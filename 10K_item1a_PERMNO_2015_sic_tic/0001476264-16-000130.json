{"cik": "1476264", "company": "WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Associated With WashingtonFirst\u2019s Business\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry.\nWashingtonFirst faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. In particular, there is very strong competition for financial services in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which it conducts its business. WashingtonFirst competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as other kinds of local and community, super-regional, national and international financial institutions and enterprises that operate offices in its primary market areas and elsewhere. WashingtonFirst\u2019s future growth and success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment.\nMany of WashingtonFirst\u2019s competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions and many offer products and services that it does not. Many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, some operate in less stringent regulatory environments. While WashingtonFirst believes it competes effectively with these other financial institutions in its primary markets, it may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, smaller asset base, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread its marketing costs across a broader market. If WashingtonFirst has to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, its net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new or to retain existing clients may reduce or limit WashingtonFirst\u2019s net income and its market share and may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s profitability depends on interest rates generally, and it may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy.\nThe economy, interest rates, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and regulatory policies have a significant influence on WashingtonFirst and the industry as a whole. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to regulate the supply of bank credit are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on borrowings from the Federal Reserve System and changes in reserve requirements with respect to deposits. These activities are used in varying\ncombinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits on a national basis, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.\nFederal Reserve monetary policies and the fiscal policies of the federal government have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. WashingtonFirst cannot predict the nature of future monetary and fiscal policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of WashingtonFirst or its subsidiaries.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s profitability depends in substantial part on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates it receives on loans and investments and the rates it pays for deposits and other sources of funds. Its net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of its control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. In recent years, the bank\u2019s interest income from its loan portfolio has been negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve has conveyed that it anticipates maintaining interest rates at low levels in an effort to stimulate the economy. A persistent low interest rate environment will adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to earn income on loans and investments. In addition, if market interest rates change so that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it earns on loans and investments, our net income could be negatively affected.\nChanges in interest rates, particularly by the Federal Reserve, which implements national monetary policy in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures, also affect the value of its loans. In setting its policy, the Federal Reserve may utilize techniques such as: (i) engaging in open market transactions in United States government securities; (ii) setting the discount rate on member bank borrowings; and (iii) changing reserve requirements. These techniques may have an adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or its business and operations. The reduction by the Federal Reserve of its historic levels of securities purchases, or \u201ctapering,\u201d could cause the interest required to be paid by WashingtonFirst on deposits and borrowings to increase leading to a reduction in its net interest margin. In addition, an increase in interest rates could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to pay the principal or interest on existing variable rate loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money. This may lead to an increase in WashingtonFirst\u2019s nonperforming assets, a decrease in loan originations, or a reduction in the value of and income from its loans, any of which could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s results of operations. WashingtonFirst tries to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk, but it is unable to completely eliminate this risk. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions, and may be adversely affected by reductions in Federal spending.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area which are, in turn, dependent to a large extent on the Federal government, particularly its local employment and spending levels. In addition, the banking industry in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, similar to other geographic markets, is affected by general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond WashingtonFirst\u2019s control. Prolonged continuation of adverse economic and financial conditions or other economic dislocation in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including a substantial reduction in the level of employment or local spending by the Federal government, could cause increases in nonperforming assets, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity and eroding capital. WashingtonFirst cannot assure you that future adverse changes in the economy in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area would not have a material adverse effect on the WashingtonFirst\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s loan portfolios have significant real estate concentration.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real estate collateral. Real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. While we believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified, these concentrations expose us to the risk that a decline in the real estate market or in the economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, could increase the levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, decrease the value of collateral and reduce loan demand. In that event, Bank\u2019s earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nCommercial, commercial real estate and construction loans tend to have larger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate and construction loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in: a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, under guidance adopted by the federal banking regulators, banks that have concentrations in construction, land development or commercial real estate loans (other than loans for majority owner occupied properties) would be expected to maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher levels of capital. We may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain as a result of our levels of construction, development and commercial real estate loans, which may require us to obtain additional capital sooner than we would otherwise seek it, which may reduce shareholder returns.\nWashingtonFirst derives a significant portion of its revenue from residential mortgage lending, a market sector that experiences significant volatility.\nA substantial portion of our consolidated net revenues (net interest income plus non-interest income) are derived from originating and selling residential mortgages. Residential mortgage lending in general has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods. An increase by the Federal Reserve in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our future loan origination volume, margins, and the value of the collateral securing our outstanding loans, may increase rates of borrower default, and may otherwise adversely affect our business. Additionally, fluctuations in housing inventory could impact the volume of mortgage loans that we originate. Further, a reduction in housing inventory could result in elevated costs, as a significant amount of loan processing and underwriting that we perform would be to qualifying borrowers for mortgage loan transactions that never materialize.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s business strategy includes the continuation of its growth plans, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if it fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively.\nWashingtonFirst has grown rapidly in the past several years, through acquisition and through organic growth. The Company intends to continue to grow in its existing banking markets (internally and through additional offices) and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise. WashingtonFirst\u2019s prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are experiencing growth. WashingtonFirst cannot assure you it will be able to maintain its rate of growth, expand its market presence in its existing markets, successfully enter new markets, or that any expansion or growth will not adversely affect its results of operations. Failure to manage WashingtonFirst\u2019s growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations, and could adversely affect its ability to successfully implement its business strategy. Also, if WashingtonFirst\u2019s growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, its operating results could be materially affected in an adverse way.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in its market areas and its ability to manage its growth. While WashingtonFirst believes it has the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage its future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed. WashingtonFirst may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nAs a strategy, WashingtonFirst has sought to increase the size of the Bank by business acquisitions, and it has grown rapidly since its incorporation. WashingtonFirst may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those entities in the future. Acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners;\n\u2022\nthe estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target entity may not be accurate;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced management, opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and generating of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to finance an acquisition and possible ownership or economic dilution to its current shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of WashingtonFirst\u2019s management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where WashingtonFirst lacks experience;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and services into its business;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on WashingtonFirst\u2019s results of operations; and\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees and clients.\nWashingtonFirst may incur substantial costs to expand, and it can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits it seeks. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful. Also, WashingtonFirst may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of its common stock, in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to its current shareholders. There is no assurance that, following any future merger or acquisition, WashingtonFirst\u2019s integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, it will achieve profits comparable to or better than its historical experience.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce its earnings and capital.\nWashingtonFirst maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate for absorbing the estimated future losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s clients relative to their financial obligations with it. The amount of future losses, however, is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values, which are beyond WashingtonFirst\u2019s control, and these future losses may exceed its current estimates. There can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the economic assumptions underlying management\u2019s estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy on a national basis or in the Bank\u2019s market area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. Although WashingtonFirst believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in its loan portfolio, WashingtonFirst cannot predict the amount of such losses or guarantee that its allowance will be adequate in the future. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Basel III Final Rules impose more stringent capital requirements, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.\nIn 2013 the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to WashingtonFirst. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Financial Reform Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios which were effective for WashingtonFirst on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the previous rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (b) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (c) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities. In addition, the final rule provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to capital and prescribes a revised approach for risk weightings that could result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.\nThe application of these more stringent capital requirements for WashingtonFirst could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s future growth opportunities, and result in regulatory actions such as a prohibition on the payment of dividends or on the repurchase of shares if it were unable to comply with such requirements.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s primary source of funds is client deposits in the Bank and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions. The deposits from the title and escrow agency customers are expected to continue to be an important component of WashingtonFirst\u2019s deposit base. Because deposits of title and escrow agency customers are directly related to home sales and refinancing activity, any decrease in this activity would adversely impact WashingtonFirst\u2019s deposit levels. Accordingly, WashingtonFirst may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include FHLB advances, sales of securities and loans, and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, as well as out-of-market time deposits. While WashingtonFirst believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if WashingtonFirst continues to grow and experience increasing loan demand. Should such sources not be adequate, WashingtonFirst may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets.\nThe profitability of the Bank will be significantly reduced if we are not able to sell mortgages.\nCurrently, the Bank generally sells virtually all of the mortgage loans originated by its subsidiary, the Mortgage Company. The profitability of the Mortgage Company depends in large part upon our ability to originate a high volume of loans and to quickly sell them in the secondary market. Thus, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to sell loans into that market.\nThe Mortgage Company\u2019s ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary\nmarket in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are government-sponsored enterprises with substantial market influence whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these government-sponsored enterprises and other institutional and non-institutional investors or any impairment of our ability to participate in such programs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have reported past substantial losses and a need for substantial amounts of additional capital. Such losses were due to these entities\u2019 business models being tied extensively to the U.S. housing market which severely contracted during the recent economic downturn. In response to the deteriorating financial condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the U.S. housing market contraction, Congress and the U.S. Treasury undertook a series of actions to stabilize these entities. The FHFA was established in July 2008 pursuant to the Regulatory Reform Act in an effort to enhance regulatory oversight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into federal conservatorship in September 2008. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have returned to profitability as a result of the housing market recovery, but their long-term financial viability is highly dependent on governmental support. If the governmental support is inadequate, these companies could fail to offer programs necessary to an active secondary market. In addition, future policies that change the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. government, including those that result in their winding down, nationalization, privatization, or elimination may have broad adverse implications for the residential mortgage market, the mortgage-backed securities market and the Mortgage Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition. If this were to occur, the Mortgage Company\u2019s ability to sell mortgage loans readily could be hampered, and the profitability of the Bank could be significantly reduced.\nChanges in fee structures by third party loan purchasers and mortgage insurers may decrease our loan production volume and the margin we can recognize on conforming home loans, and may adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn the future, third party loan purchasers may revise their fee structures and increase the costs of doing business with them. Such changes may have a negative impact on our ability to originate loans to be sold because of the increased costs of such loans and may decrease our profitability with respect to loans held for sale. In addition, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market or the underwriting criteria of these third party loan purchasers could negatively impact our results of business, operations and cash flows.\nIf we breach any of the representations or warranties we make to a purchaser or securitizer of our mortgage loans, we may be liable to the purchaser or securitizer for certain costs and damages.\nWhen we sell or securitize mortgage loans in the ordinary course of business, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our agreements require us to repurchase mortgage loans if we have breached any of these representations or warranties, in which case we may be required to repurchase such loan and record a loss upon repurchase and/or bear any subsequent loss on the loan. We may not have any remedies available to us against a third party for such losses, or the remedies available to us may not be as broad as the remedies available to the purchaser of the mortgage loan against us. In addition, if there are remedies against a third party available to us, we face further risk that such third party may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available to us. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces remedies against us, we may not be able to recover our losses from a third party and may be required to bear the full amount of the related loss.\nIf repurchase and indemnity demands increase on loans that we sell from our portfolios, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe may face risk of loss if we purchase loans from a seller that fails to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nWe generally receive representations and warranties from the originators and sellers from whom we purchase loans such that if a loan defaults and there has been a breach of such representations and warranties, we may be able to pursue a remedy against the seller of the loan for the unpaid principal and interest on the defaulted loan. However, if the originator and/or seller breach such representations and warranties and does not have the financial capacity to pay the related damages, we may be subject to the risk of loss for such loan as the originator or seller may not be able to pay such damages or repurchase loans when called upon by us to do so.\nWashingtonFirst is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict its activities and adversely affect its earnings.\nWashingtonFirst and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not WashingtonFirst\u2019s shareholders. These regulations affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on WashingtonFirst, the Bank and their respective operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on WashingtonFirst. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s recent results may not be indicative of its future results.\nWashingtonFirst may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow its business at all. In addition, its recent and rapid growth may distort some of its historical financial ratios and statistics. In the future, WashingtonFirst may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors, such as a generally stable interest rate environment, an improving real estate market, the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities, or the relative resistance of the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to economic downturns. Various factors, including economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to expand its market presence. As our asset size and earnings increase, it may become more difficult to achieve high rates of increase in assets and earnings. Additionally, it may become more difficult to achieve continued improvement in our expense levels and efficiency ratio. We may not be able to maintain the relatively low levels of nonperforming assets that we have experienced. Declines in the rate of growth of income or assets or deposits, and increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may have an adverse impact on the value of the common stock. If WashingtonFirst experiences a significant decrease in its historical rate of growth, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to the fixed nature of certain operating costs.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s small to medium-sized business target market may have fewer financial resources to withstand a downturn in the economy.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s commercial development and marketing strategy targets the banking and financial services needs of small and medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the markets in which WashingtonFirst operates, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWashingtonFirst may not be able to expand its investment advisory services and retain current clients.\nWashingtonFirst and its subsidiary Wealth Advisors, may not be able to attract new and retain current investment advisory clients due to competition from the following: commercial banks and trust companies; mutual fund companies; other investment advisory firms; law firms; brokerage firms; and other financial services companies. Their ability to successfully attract and retain clients is dependent upon their ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. Due to changes in economic conditions, the performance of Wealth Advisors may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in which investment clients\u2019 assets are invested, causing clients to seek other alternative investment options. If Wealth Advisors is not successful, the Company\u2019s results from operations and financial position may be negatively impacted.\nWashingtonFirst depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, WashingtonFirst may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. WashingtonFirst also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to customers, WashingtonFirst expects that a customer\u2019s financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. WashingtonFirst\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on customer-provided financial statements or other information which are discovered to be materially misleading.\nWashingtonFirst relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if it is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of WashingtonFirst\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. WashingtonFirst relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment which adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of WashingtonFirst\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default\noccurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, WashingtonFirst may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan and may suffer a loss.\nWashingtonFirst is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title.\nIn the course of its business, WashingtonFirst may foreclose and take title to real estate, potentially becoming subject to environmental liabilities associated with the properties. WashingtonFirst may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs or it may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. Costs associated with investigation or remediation activities can be substantial. If WashingtonFirst or the Bank is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to statutory and/or common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s business.\nNegative public opinion could damage WashingtonFirst\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to its business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in WashingtonFirst\u2019s business. Negative public opinion can result from WashingtonFirst\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose WashingtonFirst to litigation and regulatory action. Although WashingtonFirst takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with its clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of its business.\nWashingtonFirst depends on the services of key personnel, and a loss of any of those personnel could disrupt its operations and result in reduced revenues.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s success depends upon the continued service of its senior management team and upon its ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel. Competition for qualified employees is intense. In management\u2019s experience, it can take a significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of professional skills and personal attributes necessary for the successful implementation of WashingtonFirst\u2019s strategy. If WashingtonFirst loses the services of one or more of its key personnel, including key client relationship personnel, or is unable to attract additional qualified personnel, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWashingtonFirst depends on technology to compete effectively and may be required to make substantial investments in new technology, which could have a negative effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s operating results and the value of its common stock.\nThe market for financial services, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, mobile devices, computers, automation and Internet-based banking. This is particularly true for WashingtonFirst, which relies on technology to compete in its market. WashingtonFirst depends on third party vendors for portions of its data processing services. In addition to WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to finance the purchase of those services and integrate them into its operations, its ability to offer new technology-based services depends on WashingtonFirst\u2019s vendors\u2019 abilities to provide and support those services. Future advances in technology may require WashingtonFirst to incur substantial expenses that adversely affect its operating results, and WashingtonFirst\u2019s limited capital resources may make it impractical or impossible for it to keep pace with competitors possessing greater capital resources. WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to compete successfully in its banking markets may depend on the extent to which WashingtonFirst and its vendors are able to offer new technology-based services and on WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to integrate technological advances into its operations.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s reliance on technology exposes WashingtonFirst to cybersecurity risks.\nWashingtonFirst relies on digital technologies to conduct its operations, and those technologies may be compromised by the deliberate attacks by others or unintentional cybersecurity incidents. Deliberate cybersecurity attacks may seek to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Other events may not seek unauthorized access, but may seek to prevent authorized users to be able to access digital systems, referred to as \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks. A cybersecurity incident of this type, could require WashingtonFirst to incur substantial remediation and increased cybersecurity protection costs, such as implementing new technologies, hiring and training new employees and engaging third party experts and consultants. In addition, WashingtonFirst could become subject to litigation from customers whose sensitive data was obtained without their consent, and to damage to the company\u2019s reputation, which could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation. From time to time, WashingtonFirst is subject to cybersecurity attacks arising in the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, there have been no cybersecurity attacks which would have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s financial condition, results of operation or products and services.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s operations rely on certain external vendors.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support its day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. WashingtonFirst\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in its agreements for any number of reasons including: equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or simple change in their strategic focus. While WashingtonFirst has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to WashingtonFirst\u2019s business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations may not generate the cash needed to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding subordinated debt notes may have negative consequences.\nOn October 5, 2015, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with each of sixteen accredited investors (the \"Purchasers\") pursuant to which the Company sold $25 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 2025 (the \"Notes\") to the Purchasers at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. Each Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company, on the one hand, and the respective Purchasers, on the other hand.\nThe Notes were offered and sold in reliance on the exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder. Accordingly, the Notes were offered and sold exclusively to persons who are \"accredited investors\" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D.\nThe Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated October 5, 2015 (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The Trustee will also serve as the initial paying agent and registrar with respect to the Notes.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nRisks Associated with WashingtonFirst\u2019s Common Stock\nAn active liquid trading market for WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock may not develop and WashingtonFirst\u2019s stock price may be volatile.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock began trading on NASDAQ on December 24, 2012. However, an active and liquid trading market for WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock may not develop or be maintained. Liquid and active trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. The market price of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond WashingtonFirst\u2019s control.\nThe following factors could affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s stock price:\n\u2022\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s operating and financial performance;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of WashingtonFirst\u2019s financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by WashingtonFirst\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in WashingtonFirst\u2019s revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\npublication of reports or changes or withdrawals of research coverage by equity research analysts;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nsales of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock by WashingtonFirst, members of its board of directors or management, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by WashingtonFirst\u2019s shareholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to WashingtonFirst\u2019s performance.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against WashingtonFirst, could result in very substantial costs, divert WashingtonFirst\u2019s management\u2019s attention and resources and harm WashingtonFirst\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nWashingtonFirst is a relatively small public company, and compliance with the increased regulatory and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain its resources, increase its costs and distract management; and WashingtonFirst may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, WashingtonFirst is required to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, including corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NASDAQ. Amongst other things, WashingtonFirst is required to:\n\u2022\ndesign, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022\ndesign, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures to ensure the information required to be disclosed in its filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ncomply with enhanced corporate governance requirements and other rules promulgated by the NASDAQ;\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with WashingtonFirst\u2019s obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and\n\u2022\nenhance its investor relations function.\nComplying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupy a significant amount of time of WashingtonFirst\u2019s board of directors and management and significantly increase its costs and expenses.\nWashingtonFirst is an emerging growth company and its reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make its common stock less attractive to investors.\nWashingtonFirst is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and it may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, while WashingtonFirst is an emerging growth company it will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, it will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies and it will not be required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. WashingtonFirst may remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2017, though WashingtonFirst may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of its common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30, in which case it would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or (ii) if its gross revenues exceed $1 billion in any fiscal year. Investors may find WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock less attractive if WashingtonFirst relies on these exemptions and relief. If some investors find WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and its stock price may decline and/or become more volatile.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws and Virginia law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock.\nSome provisions of WashingtonFirst\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of WashingtonFirst, even if the change of control would be beneficial to and desirable by WashingtonFirst\u2019s shareholders, including:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the WashingtonFirst board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which preferred stock could have voting, liquidation, dividend or other rights superior to those of the WashingtonFirst common stock;\n\u2022\nthe inability of WashingtonFirst shareholders to act without a meeting except by unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of WashingtonFirst shareholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nlimitations on affiliated transactions and control share acquisitions;\n\u2022\nif a two-thirds majority of the WashingtonFirst board of directors has not approved certain transactions, such as an amendment to the WashingtonFirst articles of incorporation, merger, share exchange, sale of substantially all of the assets, or dissolution, the transaction must receive the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of each voting group of WashingtonFirst shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction for the transaction to be approved; and\n\u2022\nthe WashingtonFirst bylaws provide that the WashingtonFirst bylaws may be amended by the WashingtonFirst board of directors.\nThe VSCA contains provisions governing \u201caffiliated transactions.\u201d These include various transactions such as mergers, share exchanges, sales, leases, exchanges, mortgages, pledges, transfers or other material dispositions of assets, issuances of securities, dissolutions, and similar transactions with an \u201cinterested shareholder.\u201d An interested shareholder is generally the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting shares. During the three years following the date a shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, any affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder must be approved by both a majority of the \u201cdisinterested directors\u201d (those directors who were directors before the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder or who were recommended for election by a majority of disinterested directors) and by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the corporation\u2019s voting shares other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. These requirements do not apply to affiliated transactions if, among other things, a majority of the disinterested directors approve the interested shareholder\u2019s acquisition of voting shares making such a person an interested shareholder before such acquisition. Beginning three years after the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the corporation may engage in an affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder if:\n\u2022\nthe transaction is approved by the holders of two-thirds of the corporation\u2019s voting shares, other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder;\n\u2022\nthe affiliated transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or\n\u2022\nsubject to certain additional requirements, in the affiliated transaction the holders of each class or series of voting shares will receive consideration meeting specified fair price and other requirements designed to ensure that all shareholders receive fair and equivalent consideration, regardless of when they tendered their shares.\nUnder the VSCA\u2019s control share acquisitions law, voting rights of shares of stock of a Virginia corporation acquired by an acquiring person or other entity at ownership levels of 20 percent, 33 1/3 percent and 50 percent of the outstanding shares may, under certain circumstances, be denied. The voting rights may be denied:\n\u2022\nunless conferred by a special shareholder vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, other than shares held by the acquiring person and officers and directors of the corporation; or\n\u2022\namong other exceptions, such acquisition of shares is made pursuant to an affiliation agreement with the corporation or the corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation or bylaws permit the acquisition of such shares before the acquiring person\u2019s acquisition thereof.\nIf authorized in the corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation or bylaws, the statute also permits the corporation to redeem the acquired shares at the average per share price paid for them if the voting rights are not approved or if the acquiring person does not file a \u201ccontrol share acquisition statement\u201d with the corporation within 60 days of the last acquisition of such shares. If voting rights are approved for control shares comprising more than 50 percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding stock, objecting shareholders may have the right to have their shares repurchased by the corporation for \u201cfair value.\u201d\nThese provisions are only applicable to public corporations that have more than 300 shareholders, and, therefore, have only recently become applicable to WashingtonFirst. Corporations may provide in their articles of incorporation or bylaws to opt-out of these provisions, but WashingtonFirst has not done so.\nFuture sales of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock in the public market could lower its stock price, and any additional capital raised by WashingtonFirst through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.\nOn December 30, 2014, WashingtonFirst entered into separate Investment Agreements with six institutional accredited investors (collectively, the \u201cInvestors\u201d) relating to the sale by WashingtonFirst of an aggregate of 710,553 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), and an aggregate of 666,666 shares of non-voting common stock, series A, $0.01 par value per share (the \u201cSeries A Stock\u201d), at a price of $15.00 per share (the \"Private Placement\"). Each of the Investors was an existing shareholder of WashingtonFirst. WashingtonFirst received aggregate gross proceeds from the Investors of $20,658,285. WashingtonFirst also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with all of the Investors who purchased Common Stock in the Private Placement pursuant to which the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC within forty-five (45) days of the closing of the Private Placement for purposes of registering the resale of the shares of the Common Stock issued in the Private Placement.\nOn December 8, 2015, WashingtonFirst completed an underwritten public offering of 1,655,000 shares of its voting common stock, which included 215,000 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price of $20.00 per share to the public (\u201cPublic Offering\u201d). WashingtonFirst received aggregate proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $31.1 million. The voting common stock was offered pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated December 3, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the Company\u2019s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration File No. 333-202318; effective on March 11, 2015).\nWashingtonFirst may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public or private offerings or otherwise issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock in the future. WashingtonFirst filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the WashingtonFirst 2010 Equity Compensation Plan and predecessor WashingtonFirst incentive plans. In addition, upon acquiring 1st Portfolio Holding Corporation, WashingtonFirst filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the 1st Portfolio Holding Corporation 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, shares registered under WashingtonFirst\u2019s registration statements on Form S-8 will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.\nWashingtonFirst cannot predict the size of future issuances of its common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of its common stock will have on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock.\nThe concentration of WashingtonFirst\u2019s capital stock ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of March 3, 2016, the record date for purposes of the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, WashingtonFirst\u2019s directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own approximately 22.86 percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and options exercisable within sixty days. Consequently, WashingtonFirst\u2019s board of directors has significant influence over all matters that require approval by WashingtonFirst\u2019s shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions, and it may be unable to pay future cash dividends.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory, statutory and contractual restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient capital. Its only source of funds with which to pay dividends to its shareholders are dividends received from the Bank, and the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by its own obligations to maintain sufficient capital and regulatory restrictions. If these regulatory requirements are not satisfied, WashingtonFirst will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock. The Company commenced paying cash dividends in 2014 and has paid a dividend of four cents ($0.04) per share -- on the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock and Series A non-voting common stock -- on January 2, April 1, July 1 and October 1, 2014. In the fourth quarter 2014, the Company increased the quarterly cash dividend to five cents ($0.05) per share. In the fourth quarter 2015, the Company increased the quarterly cash dividend to six cents ($0.06) per share.", "PERMNO": 13713, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WFBI"}
