{"cik": "1337553", "company": "AERIE PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in an industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization\n\u2022If we or our collaborators are unable to successfully commercialize our products, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\u2022If we fail to obtain and sustain market acceptance for our products or an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our products, potential future sales would be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022We face significant competition, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\n\u2022If clinical trials are unsuccessful or delayed, we could be required to abandon development.\n\u2022Our products may have undesirable or adverse effects, which may result in the delay, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval or may limit sales of our products after regulatory approval is received.\n\u2022We may not be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our products or to expand our portfolio of product candidates.\nRisks Related to Regulation\n\u2022Regulatory approval may be substantially delayed or may not be obtained for our products if regulatory authorities require additional time or studies to assess the safety and efficacy.\n\u2022Our products subject us to ongoing regulatory requirements and we may face future development, manufacturing and regulatory difficulties.\n\u2022Legislation may increase the difficulty and cost of commercialization and affect the prices we may obtain.\n\u2022Healthcare law and policy changes may negatively impact our business, including by decreasing the prices that we and our collaborators receive for our products.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\n\u2022We anticipate continued reliance on third-party manufacturers. Production at our suppliers\u2019 facilities could be disrupted, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to satisfy demand.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\n\u2022Any collaboration arrangement that we may enter into may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products or to enter new therapeutic areas.\n\u2022We currently depend on third parties for portions of our operations, and we may not be able to control their work as effectively as if we performed these functions ourselves. If the third parties fail to comply with regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\n\u2022If we fail to manage an effective distribution process in the United States or establish an effective distribution process in jurisdictions outside the United States, our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\u2022We may not be able to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights and our proprietary technology.\n\u2022If our pending patent applications fail to issue, our business will be adversely affected.\n\u2022We may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay product development and disrupt the commercialization of or increase the costs of commercializing our products.\n\u2022We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\n\u2022We will need to obtain regulatory approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\n\u2022We have limited revenue and may never become profitable.\n\u2022We may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our products.\n\u2022Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d).\n\u2022We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes if required or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and the terms of our then-existing borrowing arrangements may limit our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\n\u2022The capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock and subject us to counterparty risk.\n\u2022We may sell additional debt or equity securities at any time, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and impose restrictions on our business.\n\u2022Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited and changes to U.S. tax laws and tax laws in other jurisdictions could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\n\u2022We depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\n\u2022Our business may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and a public health crisis.\n\u2022If we engage in acquisitions or licenses in the future, we will incur a variety of costs and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or licenses.\n\u2022Business interruptions could delay the development of our potential products and our manufacturing activities and could disrupt our potential sales. Our reputation, business and operations may suffer in the event of system failures, cyber-attacks or other security breaches or failure to comply with legal obligations related to information security.\n\u2022Our disclosure controls and procedures and our systems to implement such disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\n\u2022Any litigation could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business. Any successful litigation may result in the incurrence of substantial liability if our insurance is inadequate.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\n\u2022Certain of our existing stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and may be able to influence or control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\n\u2022As we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\n\u2022Our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization\nWe depend substantially on the success of our products, Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur business and the ability to generate revenue related to product sales depend on the successful commercialization of our products, Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, and the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of any product candidates or future product candidates for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, dry eye and retinal diseases. Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae have been approved by the FDA in the United States, and the EC has granted Centralised MAs for the European Union for Rhopressa\u00ae (where it will be marketed as Rhokiinsa\u00ae) and for Rocklatan\u00ae (where it will be marketed as Roclanda\u00ae). Rhokiinsa\u00ae has been grandfathered into a U.K. national authorisation under the country\u2019s Brexit legislation and will continue to be authorised in the United Kingdom as long as we provide the MHRA with the required additional information, and Roclanda\u00ae received a U.K. authorisation in April 2021. Neither product has received regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction and no sales can be made in any such jurisdiction unless such approval occurs. Centralized and U.K. marketing authorisations lapse if the authorized products are not placed on the market for a period of three consecutive years. If we are unable to place our products on the market for a period of three consecutive years, which might occur for a variety of reasons, both practical (manufacturing issues) and regulatory (pricing and reimbursement decisions), then we would lose the right and opportunity to do so and would have to reapply for a marketing authorisation. We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, and our prospects are highly dependent on, and a significant portion of the value of our company relates to, our ability to successfully commercialize these products. The success of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates depends on factors including:\n\u2022successfully completing clinical trials;\n\u2022receiving and maintaining current regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022developing and maintaining effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022establishing adequate manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\n\u2022establishing commercial markets;\n\u2022obtaining coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers at a commercially reasonable price point; and\n\u2022successfully competing with other products.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, or if we lose market exclusivity such as through the approval of an ANDA-the filing of which by our competitors with respect to Rhopressa\u00ae and/or Rocklatan\u00ae is possible as of December 18, 2021, if such filing contains a Paragraph IV Certification, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates or to expand into new markets. This could materially harm our business, and we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.\nThe commercial success of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on the degree of market acceptance among eye-care professionals, patients, patient advocacy groups, healthcare payers and the medical community.\nThe commercial success of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in the United States will depend on the degree of market acceptance among eye-care professionals, patients, patient advocacy groups, healthcare payers, including pharmacy benefit managers, and the medical community. Similarly, if Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae are approved in jurisdictions outside the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom or any product candidates or future product candidates are approved in any jurisdiction in which they may receive approval, those products may not gain such market acceptance in such jurisdictions. There are a number of available therapies marketed for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, dry eye and retinal diseases. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, but most others, including latanoprost and many beta blockers, in the case of glaucoma treatment, are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by eye-care professionals, patients and third-party payers. Insurers and other third-party payers may also encourage the use of generic products, either in preference to or prior to the use of brand therapies. The degree of market\nacceptance of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the market price, affordability and patient out-of-pocket costs, relative to other available products, which are predominantly generics;\n\u2022the possibility that third-party payers will not give favorable positions on their formularies or will place restrictions on their use, including through use of step therapy or prior authorization programs;\n\u2022the timing of market introduction;\n\u2022their effectiveness as compared with currently available products;\n\u2022eye-care professional willingness to prescribe and patient willingness to adopt them in place of current therapies;\n\u2022varying patient characteristics including demographic factors such as age, health, race and economic status;\n\u2022changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in labeling;\n\u2022limitations in the approved clinical indications and MOA(s);\n\u2022our success in demonstrating their benefits including relative convenience and ease of initiation, prescription and administration;\n\u2022the strength of our selling, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022the quality of our relationships with eye-care professionals, patient advocacy groups, third-party payers and the medical community;\n\u2022the continuous availability of quality manufactured products;\n\u2022sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u2022the degree to which the products are subject to material product liability claims.\nAs we have done with Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, it is possible that we may find it necessary or desirable to provide rebates on product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, to customers or third-party payers or to implement patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs, which could affect our profitability. In addition, we do not know how eye-care professionals, patients and third-party payers will continue to respond to the pricing of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in the United States or how they will respond to their pricing in jurisdictions outside the United States, or the pricing of any product candidates or future product candidates in any jurisdiction, if approved.\nThe market opportunities for our currently marketed or potential products, if approved, are difficult to precisely estimate. Our estimates of these market opportunities include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, independent sources have not verified our assumptions. If any of these assumptions prove to be inaccurate and the actual market for any of our products post-regulatory approval is smaller than we expect or if we fail to maintain market acceptance or fail to achieve market acceptance, our potential product revenue may be limited, and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, by third-party payers, potential future sales would be materially adversely affected.\nThe course of treatment for patients with open-angle glaucoma, dry eye and retinal diseases includes primarily older drugs, and the leading products for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, dry eye and retinal diseases currently in the market, including latanoprost and timolol, in the case of glaucoma treatment, are available as generic drugs. Therefore, there will be no commercially viable market for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, without adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and any reimbursement policy may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. We have obtained broad formulary coverage for our glaucoma franchise products for the lives covered under commercial plans and Medicare Part D plans. We cannot be certain that those levels of coverage will continue to increase, or that we will be able to maintain those levels of coverage. Further, we cannot be certain that adequate\ncoverage and reimbursement will be available for either of our products in jurisdictions outside the United States or for any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved. Additionally, even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of coverage or reimbursement is below our expectations, our anticipated revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payers, such as government or private healthcare insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, carefully review and increasingly question and challenge the coverage of and the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. Reimbursement rates may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. A current trend in the United States healthcare industry is toward cost containment. Large public and private payers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, treatments. Such third-party payers, including Medicare, may question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payers limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. Third-party payers may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives in the U.S. healthcare industry could decrease the price we have established for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. Our products are currently priced higher than existing generic drugs and consistently with current branded drugs. If we are unable to show a significant benefit relative to existing generic drugs, Medicare, Medicaid and private payers may not be willing to reimburse for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of them gaining market acceptance. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted.\nWe believe that U.S. third-party payers consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness, safety and tolerability of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and will consider such factors of any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, and whether use of any such products should be a covered benefit under its health plan in determining whether to approve coverage and reimbursement for such products and at what level. Obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not maintain approval for reimbursement of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, from third-party payers on a timely or satisfactory basis or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare carrier level or by fiscal intermediaries. Medicare Part D, which provides a pharmacy benefit to Medicare patients as discussed below, does not require participating prescription drug plans to cover all drugs within a class of products. Our business could be materially adversely affected if Part D prescription drug plans were to limit access to or deny or limit reimbursement of any of our approved products.\nReimbursement in the European Union must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. Reimbursement in the United Kingdom will also need to be negotiated separately. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or a collaborator may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of any of our products, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, to other available therapies. If the prices for any of our products, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, our revenue, potential for future cash flows and prospects for profitability will suffer. Also, we or a collaborator may not be able to launch the product uniformly throughout the European Union but may have to commence commercial operations on a country-by-country basis, which could complicate the launching process and negatively affect our sales.\nWe face competition from larger established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies and if our competitors are able to develop and market products that are preferred over our products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from larger established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat patients with open-angle glaucoma, dry eye, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye. Our products currently compete directly against companies producing existing and future glaucoma treatment products. To the extent we develop proprietary compounds for use beyond glaucoma, we will face competition from companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions operating in such new therapeutic areas.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Early-stage companies are also developing treatments for open-angle glaucoma, dry eye and retinal diseases and may prove to be significant competitors. We expect that our competitors will continue to develop new treatments for open-angle glaucoma, dry eye and retinal diseases, which may include eye drops, oral treatments, surgical procedures, implantable devices or laser treatments. Alternative treatments beyond eye drops continue to develop. For example, although surgical procedures are currently used in severe cases, less invasive procedures are currently under development, and we expect that we will compete with other companies that develop implantable devices or other products or procedures for use in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, dry eye and retinal diseases.\nEarly-stage companies may also compete through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer adverse effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payers encourage the use of generic products. Ophthalmology is currently dominated by generic drugs, such as latanoprost and timolol, in the case of glaucoma treatment, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. In the United States, we currently enjoy regulatory exclusivity for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae through December 18, 2022, although competitors are permitted to file ANDAs as of December 18, 2021, if the ANDA contains a certification that the proposed generic product will not infringe or that our patents are allegedly invalid. Our current products are priced at a premium over competitive generic products and consistent with other branded glaucoma drugs. Our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022obtain and maintain patent protection and non-patent exclusivity in all current and potential commercial jurisdictions for our products;\n\u2022attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022continue to build an effective selling and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022demonstrate the advantages of our products compared to alternative therapies, including, in the case of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, other currently marketed PGA and non-PGA products;\n\u2022identify and develop additional product candidates to expand our current product portfolio;\n\u2022compete against other products with fewer contraindications; and\n\u2022obtain and sustain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.\nIf our competitors\u2019 market products that are more effective, safer, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our products or that reach the market sooner than any of our product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, we may not achieve commercial success.\nFailure can occur at any stage of clinical development. If the clinical trials are unsuccessful or delayed, we could be required to abandon development.\nA failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing for a variety of reasons. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. In addition, adverse events may occur or other risks may be discovered in Phase 3 registration trials that may cause us to suspend or terminate our clinical trials. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in or adherence to trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations and the rates of dropout among clinical trial participants. Our future clinical trial results therefore may not demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in jurisdictions outside the United States or for any product candidates or future product candidates in any jurisdiction.\nFlaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well-advanced or after data results have been obtained. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute clinical trials on time to support regulatory approval. In addition, clinical trials often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. Further, regulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Since our inception, we have not voluntarily or involuntarily suspended or terminated a clinical trial due to unacceptable safety risks to participants.\nIf the results of any of our clinical trials do not achieve the primary efficacy endpoints or demonstrate unexpected safety issues, the prospects for approval of our product candidates will be materially adversely affected. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations, analyses and entry criteria, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have failed to achieve similar results in later clinical trials, including longer term trials, or have failed to obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical trials or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected adverse effects that have prevented further development of the compound. Our ongoing clinical trials for regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States may not produce the results that we expect and remain subject to the risks associated with clinical drug development as indicated above.\nThe breadth of the labeling of any product or product candidate, if approved, will depend upon providing evidence of such product\u2019s MOA(s) that is satisfactory to the applicable regulatory authority. Failure to do so will limit the types of claims we will be able to make in our product marketing and labeling. For example, based on the results of our preclinical and clinical studies, we believed Rhopressa\u00ae reduced IOP through additional MOAs; however, Rhopressa\u00ae received FDA approval for only one MOA, ROCK inhibition or the mechanism by which Rhopressa\u00ae increases outflow of aqueous humor through the TM of the eye, as reflected in the Rhopressa\u00ae product labeling.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events that could cause our clinical trials to be unsuccessful, delayed, suspended or terminated, or which could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or implement a clinical hold;\n\u2022the number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we estimate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022regulators or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022we may elect or be required to suspend or terminate clinical trials based on a finding that the participants are being exposed to health risks;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022the supply or quality of product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022product candidates may have undesirable adverse effects or other unexpected characteristics.\nIf we elect or are required to suspend or terminate a clinical trial, our commercial prospects will be adversely impacted and our ability to generate product revenues may be delayed or eliminated.\nRhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates may have undesirable or adverse effects, which may result in the delay, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval or may require our products to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales after regulatory approval is received.\nUnforeseen adverse effects from Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, even after approval, after the approved product has been marketed. To date, the main tolerability finding of Rhopressa\u00ae has been mild conjunctival hyperemia, or eye redness. In our Phase 3 registration trials, some\npatients also experienced conjunctival hemorrhages, or petechiae, corneal verticillata, blurry vision, and decreased visual acuity as adverse events. Rocklatan\u00ae combines Rhopressa\u00ae with latanoprost. To date, the main tolerability finding of Rocklatan\u00ae has also been mild conjunctival hyperemia. In our Phase 3 registration trials, some patients also experienced conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pruritus, increased lacrimation, reduced visual acuity, blepharitis, punctate keratitis and corneal disorder as adverse events. The main adverse effects of latanoprost include conjunctival hyperemia, irreversible change in iris color, discoloration of the skin around the eyes and droopiness of eyelids caused by the loss of orbital fat. New data relating to Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae, including from any adverse event reports or any negative results during clinical development for additional indications, may emerge at any time.\nAny undesirable or adverse effects that may be caused by any such products or product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from successfully commercializing such products or product candidates, if approved, and generating or continuing to generate revenues from their sale. In addition, if we or others identify undesirable or adverse effects caused by Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates after regulatory approval we could face consequences relating to regulations, litigation or reputational harm, including the withdrawal of regulatory approval of the affected product. These events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating or continuing to generate revenues from its sale.\nWe may not be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates or to expand our portfolio of product candidates.\nWe continue to explore other therapeutic opportunities in ophthalmology through internal research programs and from time to time we may explore such opportunities through research collaboration arrangements or acquisitions and may seek to commercialize a portfolio of new ophthalmic drugs or technologies in addition to Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae. For example, in 2019, we acquired Avizorex, a Spanish ophthalmic pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of dry eye disease. Our clinical operations to date have been limited to developing product candidates for the treatment of glaucoma, ocular hypertension, retinal diseases and dry eye disease, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop, license or acquire any drugs or technologies in new therapeutic areas or at all.\nPreclinical studies require additional research and development, which in some cases may include significant preclinical, clinical and other testing, prior to initiating clinical development or seeking regulatory approval to market new indications, technologies and/or product candidates. Accordingly, these additional indications, technologies and product candidates will not be commercially available for a number of years, if at all.\nResearch programs, including through collaboration arrangements, to pursue the development of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates for additional indications and to identify new product candidates, technologies, therapeutic areas and disease targets require substantial technical, financial and human resources whether or not we ultimately are successful. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential additional indications, technologies, therapeutic areas and/or product candidates, yet fail to yield results for clinical development for a number of reasons.\nWe are also focused on furthering the development of our product candidates and future product candidates for treatment of retinal diseases and dry eye disease. The decision whether to pursue, and the timing of, any additional preclinical research programs is subject to a number of factors and we may suspend or discontinue research programs at any time.\nIn addition, because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to identify or develop additional therapeutic opportunities for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates or any uses for our existing proprietary compounds beyond glaucoma or to develop suitable potential product candidates or technologies through internal research programs, research collaboration arrangements or acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our future growth and prospects.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nRegulatory approval may be substantially delayed or may not be obtained for our products in jurisdictions outside the United States or for any product candidates or future product candidates in any jurisdiction if regulatory authorities require additional time or studies to assess the safety and efficacy.\nWe may be unable to initiate or complete development of our products in jurisdictions outside the United States on schedule, if at all. If applicable regulatory authorities require additional time or studies to assess the safety or efficacy of any of our products, product candidates or future product candidates, we may require funding beyond the amounts currently on our balance sheet. In addition, in the event of any unforeseen costs or other business decisions, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate funding to complete the necessary steps for approval of any of our products, product candidates or future product candidates. Preclinical studies and clinical trials required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of drug products are time consuming and expensive and together take several years or more to complete. Delays in regulatory approvals or rejections of applications for regulatory approval in the United States, Europe, Japan or other markets may result from many factors, including:\n\u2022our inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial;\n\u2022regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022regulatory questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding product candidates or other products;\n\u2022clinical holds, other regulatory objections to commencing or continuing a clinical trial or the inability to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial in countries that require such approvals;\n\u2022failure to reach agreement with the applicable regulators regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria in our clinical trials;\n\u2022our inability to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022unfavorable or inconclusive results of clinical trials and supportive non-clinical studies, including unfavorable results regarding the effectiveness or safety of product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u2022any determination that a clinical trial or product candidate presents unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions;\n\u2022our inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022our inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indications targeted by any of our product candidates;\n\u2022our inability to obtain approval from IRBs to conduct clinical trials at their respective sites;\n\u2022the failure of a third party to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including site inspections and inspection readiness;\n\u2022our inability to timely manufacture or obtain from third parties sufficient quantities or quality of the product candidate or other materials required for a clinical trial; and\n\u2022difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may also occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols submitted to applicable regulatory authorities to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nRegulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as in Europe and Japan and in emerging markets, have specific requirements for approval of drugs for commercial sale with which we must comply prior to marketing in those areas. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and\nobtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. For all of these reasons, we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies with respect to our product candidates beyond those that are initially contemplated, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other studies or if the results of these studies are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval for that product candidate, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval at all or we may obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended. Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals and we may not have sufficient funding to complete the testing and approval process. Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products if and when approved. If any of this occurs, our business will be materially harmed.\nThe United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, with a transitional period that ended on December 31, 2020. Rhokiinsa\u00ae has been grandfathered into a U.K. national authorisation under the country's Brexit legislation, and Roclanda\u00ae received a U.K. authorisation. We expect both will continue to be authorised in the United Kingdom as long as we provide the MHRA with the required additional information and do not have three consecutive years without sales.\nRhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, subject us to ongoing regulatory requirements and we may face future development, manufacturing and regulatory difficulties.\nRhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae are, and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, will be, subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, submission of safety and other post-market approval information, importation and exportation. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturing facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and EMA requirements and the requirements of other similar agencies, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current good manufacturing requirements (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work are required to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We are also required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and the EMA and other similar agencies and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs also are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Accordingly, we may not promote any product for indications, uses or claims for which they are not approved, even though physicians may prescribe them for those uses. If we want to expand any such indications for which we may market a product, we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals, which may not be granted.\nSince the 1970s, by regulation, the FDA has classified dispensers of ophthalmic drugs as drugs when packaged with the drugs. However, the FDA has informed us that, as a result of unrelated litigation regarding the definition of a medical device and despite not taking measures to repeal the existing regulation, the FDA has reconsidered this classification and determined that such products should be classified as drug-led drug-device combination products. This change in classification subjects our dispensers to regulation as device components of combination products. We are still evaluating the impact this change in classification, if maintained by the FDA, will have on our approved products, including supplements requesting approval of changes to our NDAs, and our product candidates, as well as our operations. We cannot predict if this change in classification will be subject to challenge or what the outcome of any such challenge would be.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where such product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of such product, or finds that we have engaged in the promotion of off-label use, it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of that product from the market. If either of our products fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022require product recalls;\n\u2022mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022require us or our potential future collaborators to enter into a consent decree or permanent injunction, which can include shutdown of manufacturing facilities, imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022impose other administrative or judicial civil or criminal penalties or pursue criminal prosecution;\n\u2022withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or by our potential future collaborators;\n\u2022impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022seize or detain products.\nExisting and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost of commercializing our potential products and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products or restrict or regulate post-marketing activities. In the United States, legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced at both the state and federal level to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether agencies such as the FDA will issue new guidance or interpretations, whether existing guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our sales and promotional activities for our approved products or the marketing approvals of our potential products may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing approval testing and other requirements.\nIf we are found in violation of U.S. federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws or other healthcare laws and regulations, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be suspended from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn the United States, our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable anti-bribery, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates. Restrictions under applicable federal and state anti-bribery and healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u2022The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\n\u2022The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to the government, including the federal healthcare programs, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Many states have similar false claims laws. Cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products or the provision of kickbacks have resulted in the submission of false claims to governmental healthcare programs.\n\u2022Under the HIPAA, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services to obtain money or property of any healthcare benefit program.\nViolations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from\ncontracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the Federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nIn addition, certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, are required to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with the information made publicly available on a searchable website.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\u2019s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing, price, and/or price increase disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties.\nFurthermore, the government purchasing and reimbursement programs include remedies such as the obligation to correct reported prices and pay additional rebates (depending on the direction of the correction) or pay restitution to the extent the government overpaid for covered drugs, In addition, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for conduct such as failure to provide required information, late submission of required information, false information, and knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.\nLaw enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. While we believe we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, it is possible that the government could allege violations of, or convict us of violating, these laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental funded federal or state healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Were this to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we face allegations of noncompliance with the law and encounter sanctions, our reputation, revenues and liquidity may suffer, and Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to continue to generate revenues from our product sales, our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the need to raise capital to fund our operations will be increased.\nHealthcare law and policy changes may negatively impact our business, including by decreasing the prices that we and our collaborators receive for our products.\nIn recent years, the United States has enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory actions and executive orders affecting the healthcare system that may impact our ability to profitably sell any product for which we obtain marketing approval. For example, the federal government has implemented reforms to government healthcare programs in the United States, including changes to the methods for, and amounts of, Medicare reimbursement and changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The implementation of certain of these policy changes has decreased our revenues and increased our costs, and federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payers continue to focus on containing the cost of prescription drugs. Further legislative and regulatory changes, and increasing pressure from social sources, are likely to further influence the manner in which our products are priced, reimbursed, prescribed and purchased.\nThe Medicare Modernization Act (\u201cMMA\u201d) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly by establishing Medicare Part D and introduced a reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs under Medicare Part B. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that are covered in any therapeutic class under the\nPart D program. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for any of our approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) added provisions to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, PPACA increased manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products and required manufacturers to provide a discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d which is now 70% of the negotiated price. There have been efforts to repeal or overturn PPACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the PPACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is uncertain how any such challenges and the healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business.\nIn addition, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) through FDA has issued a final rule to permit importation of certain pharmaceutical products provided certain requirements can be met. Litigation was initiated with regard to this final rule and the Biden Administration has defended the final rule. The litigation is ongoing. In addition, former President Trump and President Biden both issued Executive Orders intended to favor government procurement from domestic manufacturers.\nOn November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law or unless it is passed through to the dispensing pharmacy and reflected in the price to the patient. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. In addition, effective January 1, 2024, a provision capping the rebate amount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program at 100% of AMP will be eliminated, which means that a manufacturer could pay a rebate amount on a unit of the drug that is greater than the price the manufacturer receives for the drug. Further, effective January 1, 2023, a final rule issued by CMS will change the way copay assistance program prices are treated in best price for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. This change could result in manufacturers eliminating their patient assistance programs, which would make many innovator drugs more expensive for patients. This final rule is subject to ongoing litigation, but it is not clear when a decision will be made or how the court will rule.\nOn September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The HHS plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare Part D authority to negotiate drug prices, require drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress. It is unclear to what extent these and other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented, and to what extent these or any future legislation or regulations by the Biden administration will have on our business, including market acceptance, and sales, of our products and product candidates.\nIn addition, the Health Resources and Services Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d) recently referred several manufacturers to the HHS Office of Inspector General for consideration of assessment of civil monetary penalties over the manufacturers\u2019 policies that place restrictions on 340B pricing to 340B Covered Entities that utilize contract pharmacies. Under the 340B program, manufacturers are required to charge specified categories of federally funded clinics and safety net hospitals (known as 340B Covered Entities) no more than an established discounted price for their covered outpatient drugs. The program is designed to give 340B Covered Entities access to the same discount obtained by Medicaid under the Medicaid drug rebate program. 340B Covered Entities that do not have their own pharmacies may contract with outside pharmacies to dispense drugs to the Covered Entity\u2019s patients, though concerns about pharmacies diverting 340B drugs to non-340B patients has recently led to the manufacturer restrictions described above and manufacturer litigation over whether a 340B Covered Entity is permitted to contract with multiple outside pharmacies. This litigation is ongoing.\nAlso, some states have enacted or are considering legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices and coverage and reimbursement levels of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the United States and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases.\nIn addition, governments in countries outside the United States control the costs of pharmaceuticals. Many European countries and Canada have established pricing and reimbursement policies that contain costs by referencing the price of the same or similar products in other countries. In these instances, if coverage or the level of reimbursement is reduced, limited or eliminated in one or more countries, we may be unable to obtain or maintain anticipated pricing or reimbursement in other countries or in new markets. This may influence our decision whether to sell a product in one or more countries, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans. It is also possible that governments may take additional action to reform the healthcare system in response to the evolving effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nHealthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for our products, increases in the rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on the prices that we and our collaborators receive for our products. We cannot be certain as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of future healthcare law and policy changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential changes; however, such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could materially and adversely affect our revenue or sales of our current or future products and product candidates, as well as those of our collaborators. These actions and the uncertainty about the future PPACA are likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nThese actions and the uncertainty about the future PPACA are likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nIf we or third-party manufacturers fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBefore we or a third party can begin commercial manufacturing of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, we or the third party must obtain regulatory approval of our or their manufacturing facilities, processes and quality systems. If we or our third-party manufacturers do not have a cGMP compliant status or other comparable status acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authority, as applicable, approval of any NDA or other application that includes those manufacturers will be delayed.\nDue to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, we or any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner. We or any of our contract manufacturers may fail to satisfy or comply with manufacturing regulations. If we or our contract manufacturers do not have a compliance status acceptable to the FDA, regulatory approval and/or commercial supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, will be significantly delayed and may result in significant additional costs.\nIn addition, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval, and must comply with cGMP. We or our contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. In addition, failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury, product liability claims, product shortages, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. If we or a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, product liability claims, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, will require prior FDA or other regulatory review and/or approval of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with the FDA\u2019s regulations or comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the launch or commercial production of a product. The new facility will also be subject to pre-approval inspection. In addition, we have to demonstrate that the product made at the new facility is equivalent to the product made at the former facility by physical and chemical methods, which are costly and\ntime consuming. It is also possible that the FDA or other regulatory authority may require clinical testing as a way to prove equivalency, which would result in additional costs and delay.\nWhile we expect to rely heavily on our own manufacturing capabilities at our Athlone plant, there will be continued reliance on third-party manufacturers for the commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae as back-up suppliers and the development of any product candidates or future product candidates in accordance with manufacturing regulations, beyond our recent progress in internal manufacturing capabilities.\nWith respect to the commercial production of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we currently have contractual relationships for finished product manufacturing with two vendors and are outsourcing the production of the API. To the extent we terminate our existing supplier arrangements in the future and seek to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers, we may experience a delay in our ability to obtain our clinical or commercial supplies.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u2022manufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers give greater priority to the supply of other products over Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of their agreements with us;\n\u2022delays in obtaining regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae and/or Rocklatan\u00ae outside the United States or any product candidates or future product candidates, if our third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy or comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment or operator error;\n\u2022the failure of the third-party manufacturer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nFor example, in October 2016, we were required to withdraw the initial submission of our NDA for Rhopressa\u00ae due to a contract manufacturer of our drug product not being prepared for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. We resubmitted the Rhopressa\u00ae NDA in February 2017 upon receiving confirmation from the contract manufacturer that it was prepared for FDA inspection and the Rhopressa\u00ae NDA was subsequently approved in December 2017.\nIn addition, our manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business. In the event of a natural disaster, business failure, strike or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace a third-party manufacturer in a timely manner and the production of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates could be interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs. We may also have to incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and undertake remediation efforts.\nIn January 2017, we established our own manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, and we completed the build-out during the second quarter of 2019. In January 2020 and September 2020, we received FDA approval to produce Rocklatan\u00ae and Rhopressa\u00ae, respectively, at the Athlone manufacturing plant for commercial distribution in the United States. The Athlone manufacturing plant began manufacturing commercial supplies of Rocklatan\u00ae in the first quarter of 2020 and Rhopressa\u00ae in the third quarter of 2020 for distribution to the United States. The Athlone manufacturing plant has also manufactured clinical supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae for the Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan as well as registration batches to support product approval in Japan. We expect that the Athlone manufacturing plant will have adequate capacity to produce Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae for the United States as well as both the European and Japanese commercial markets. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture our final drug product on a commercial scale or in accordance with manufacturing regulations. If our manufacturing operations fail to achieve regulatory approval or to effectively produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, or until such time we are capable of developing internal manufacturing capabilities, we will be required to rely solely on third-party manufacturers to meet our commercial manufacturing needs, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe commenced operation of our cGMP-validated manufacturing facility in RTP for production of ophthalmic implants using the proprietary PRINT\u00ae technology platform in the fourth quarter of 2018. We anticipate that this facility will be the primary manufacturer of our implant product candidates.\nProduction at our suppliers\u2019 facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers' demands.\nA disruption in production at our suppliers\u2019 facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions or interruptions of production or operations could occur for many reasons, including accidents, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, cyber security incidents, terrorism, acts of war or political unrest, disease or public health crises, strikes or other labor unrest, transportation interruption or other unforeseen events as a result of weather, fire, natural disasters or otherwise. Additional facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production due to the need for FDA approval, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key suppliers is unable to produce our products or raw materials for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers\u2019 needs, which may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf we or our collaborators are unable to successfully obtain regulatory approval and commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in jurisdictions outside the United States, our business may be harmed.\nTo obtain regulatory approval and commercial success for our products in jurisdictions outside the United States, we must either conduct clinical trials and develop a sales and marketing organization in such jurisdictions or outsource these functions to third parties through collaboration agreements. In October 2020, we announced the First Santen Agreement for the development and commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in Japan. In December 2021, we entered into the Second Santen Agreement, which expands the scope of the First Santen Agreement, and granted Santen the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in Europe, China, India, the Middle East, CIS, Africa, parts of Latin America and the Oceania countries. We have limited experience conducting clinical trials in jurisdictions outside the United States and no experience selling, marketing or distributing any drug product in any jurisdictions outside the United States. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing for a variety of reasons. See \u201c-Risks Related to Development and Commercialization-Failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. If the clinical trials are unsuccessful or delayed, we could be required to abandon development.\u201d Other companies have experienced unsuccessful product launches and failed to meet expectations of market potential, including companies with significantly more experience and resources than we do, and there can be no guarantee that we or our collaborators will successfully launch any product in any jurisdictions outside the United States. If we enter into any collaboration agreement, such as the Santen Agreements, our collaborator may not advance the clinical trials or commercialization milestones as quickly or as successfully as we had expected. See \u201c-Any collaboration arrangement that we may enter into may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize any product candidates or future product candidates or technologies or to enter new therapeutic areas.\u201d If we pursue on our own a sales and marketing strategy in an additional jurisdiction, which may occur if a collaboration agreement does not result in a successful product launch, we would incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional time and management resources if we were to establish and train a sales force to market and sell our products in jurisdictions outside the United States. We may not be able to successfully obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our products on our expected timing or at all despite these additional expenditures.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to successfully obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our products outside the United States include:\n\u2022regulatory questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding product candidates or other products;\n\u2022clinical holds, other regulatory objections to commencing or continuing a clinical trial or the inability to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial in countries that require such approvals;\n\u2022failure to reach agreement with the applicable regulators regarding the scope or design of the clinical trials;\n\u2022an inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the clinical trials;\n\u2022an inability to compete with other pharmaceutical companies to recruit, hire, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel with requisite knowledge of our target market;\n\u2022an inability to effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing organization in such jurisdictions;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to adequate numbers of eye-care professionals to prescribe any future approved products;\n\u2022failure to adhere to regulatory requirements governing the sale of products in any jurisdiction;\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization;\n\u2022a delay in bringing products to market after efforts to hire and train our sales force have already commenced; and\n\u2022failure to maintain the relationship contemplated by a collaboration agreement for a territory leading to its termination.\nIn the event we are unable to successfully market and promote our products, our business may be harmed.\nAny collaboration arrangement that we may enter into may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products, any product candidates or future product candidates or technologies or to enter new therapeutic areas.\nWe continually explore and discuss additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas with potential partners and on our own. We may seek collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or universities for the development or commercialization of our product candidates or future product candidates or technologies. As part of our globalization strategy, in October 2020, we entered into the First Santen Agreement to advance our clinical development and ultimately commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in Japan and East Asia and in December 2021, we entered into the Second Santen Agreement to advance our clinical development and ultimately commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in Europe, China, India, the Middle East, the CIS, Africa, parts of Latin America and the Oceania countries. We will face, to the extent that we decide to enter into additional collaboration agreements, significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are often complicated and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish, implement and maintain collaborations or other alternative arrangements and the terms of such arrangements may not be favorable to us. If and when we collaborate with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate and/or technology, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate and/or technology to the third party. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any collaboration or licensing arrangement or similar strategic transaction we enter into will result in the benefits that we anticipate.\nPursuant to the First Santen Agreement and the Second Santen Agreement, there are various development milestones and sales milestones. If Santen is not able to hit the milestones within the timeframes contemplated by each agreement, as applicable, or at all, our development and commercialization efforts in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and the other countries will be harmed. Additionally, Santen Pharmaceuticals may terminate the First Santen Agreement if, among other events, there are patents issued that may prevent the commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and such discretionary termination would require us to repay up to approximately 85% of a $50.0 million upfront payment, which Santen paid pursuant to the First Santen Agreement, all development milestone payments, and 50% of the development expenses incurred by Santen Pharmaceuticals. Any such discretionary termination of the First Santen Agreement may adversely affect us financially and could harm our reputation. Furthermore, under the Second Santen Agreement, if among other events, there are patents issued in China that may prevent the commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we would be required to repay $8.0 million of the $88.0 upfront payment, which Santen SA paid in January 2022.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding research, clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate or technology and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority. In addition, collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our preclinical molecules or product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on our results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products or technologies, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities. Collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration may adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.\nWe have entered into collaboration arrangements and intend to continue exploring the licensing of commercialization rights or other forms of collaboration outside of the United States and we have developed internal manufacturing capabilities in Ireland, both of which will expose us to additional risks of conducting business in international markets.\nEntering markets outside of the United States is a component of our growth strategy. If we fail to successfully commercialize, obtain licenses or enter into collaboration arrangements with selling parties, or if these parties are not successful, our revenue-generating growth potential will be adversely affected. As part of this strategy, we completed the build-out of our manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, for additional commercial production of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in the second quarter of 2019. In January 2020 and September 2020, respectively, we received FDA approval to produce Rocklatan\u00ae and Rhopressa\u00ae, respectively, at the Athlone manufacturing plant for commercial distribution in the United States. The Athlone manufacturing plant began manufacturing commercial supplies of Rocklatan\u00ae in the first quarter of 2020 and Rhopressa\u00ae in the third quarter of 2020 for distribution to the United States. The Athlone manufacturing plant has also manufactured clinical supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae for the Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan. We expect that the Athlone manufacturing plant will have adequate capacity to produce Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae for the United States as well as both the European and Japanese commercial markets, but there can be no guaranty that the facility will be able to manufacture products with specifications unique to any particular jurisdiction. We have entered into the First Santen Agreement to advance our clinical development and ultimately commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in Japan and East Asia and, pursuant to the Second Santen Agreement, we intend to utilize the Athlone manufacturing plant to manufacture and supply Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae for Europe and the other territories covered by such agreement. Our offices in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Japan assist with our international expansion. International operations and business relationships subject us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations, including:\n\u2022efforts to enter into or expand collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties in connection with our international sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution efforts may increase our expenses or divert our management\u2019s attention from the acquisition or development of product candidates;\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition or changes in governmental regulations and laws;\n\u2022differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals, manufacturing and marketing internationally;\n\u2022difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022potential third-party patent rights in countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022changes in tariffs, trade barriers and other regulatory requirements including those governing data privacy;\n\u2022divergent environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability, particularly in non-U.S. economies and markets, including several countries in Europe;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees traveling abroad;\n\u2022the effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences (including the tax reform law that was enacted in the United States in December 2017) that create uncertainty with respect to the tax impact on our business operations and profitability;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incidental to doing business in another country;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022the potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;\n\u2022failure of our employees and contracted third parties to comply with Office of Foreign Asset Control rules and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other extra-territorial anti-bribery laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes and fires.\nThese and other risks may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or ability to attain or sustain revenue from international markets.\nWe currently depend on third parties to conduct some of the operations of our clinical trials and other portions of our operations, and we may not be able to control their work as effectively as if we performed these functions ourselves.\nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to oversee and conduct our clinical trials and to perform the related data collection and analysis. We expect to rely on these third parties to conduct clinical trials of any product candidates or future product candidates that we develop. These parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. In addition, any CRO that we retain will be subject to the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements or similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Our agreements with third-party service providers are on a trial-by-trial and project-by-project basis. Typically, we may terminate the agreements with notice and are responsible for the third party\u2019s incurred costs. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials and commercial supply. Any performance failure on the part of our third-party vendors could delay, as applicable, clinical development, regulatory approval or commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities, and we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan, the protocols for the trial and the FDA\u2019s regulations and international standards, referred to as GCP requirements, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Preclinical studies must also be conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act requirements. Managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers.\nFurthermore, these third parties may produce or manufacture competing drugs or may have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. The use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations and meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols according to regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our financial results and the commercial prospects for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, could be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to obtain regulatory approval (as applicable) and commence product sales could be delayed.\nIf we fail to manage an effective distribution process in the United States or establish an effective distribution process in jurisdictions outside the United States, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have established the infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products in which third-party logistics wholesalers warehouse Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and distribute them to pharmacies and will need to establish such infrastructures in jurisdictions outside the United States. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations, and the failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the continued commercialization of our products could be disrupted or the commercial launch and sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in jurisdictions outside the United States, in any such case, or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nA significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a limited number of distributors, and any decrease in revenue from these distributors could harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of distributors, including McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation. We further expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of distributors in the foreseeable future. We do not have long-term commitments from our distributors to carry our products, and any of our distributors may from quarter to quarter comprise a significant concentration of our revenues. Our dependence on a few distributors could expose us to the risk of substantial losses if any single large distributor stops purchasing our products, purchases a lower quantity of our products or goes out of business and we cannot find substitute distributors on equivalent terms without delays, if at all. While we may be able to shift our business to one of our other existing distributors or to a new distributor, there may be disruption in the interim. In addition, any reduction in the prices we receive for our products could adversely impact our revenues and financial condition. If we lose our relationship with any of our significant distributors, we could experience delays in the distribution of our products and could also experience declines in our revenues which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology in the marketplace.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability and any future licensee\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We believe we will be able to obtain, through prosecution of our current pending patent applications, adequate patent protection for our proprietary drug technology. If we are compelled to spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing or acquiring, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed. If we are unable to effectively protect the intellectual property that we own, other companies may be able to offer the same or similar products for sale, which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Our patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing the same or similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical products are often complex and uncertain. The standards of patentability as well as the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents in the United States and many jurisdictions outside of the United States is not consistent. For example, in many jurisdictions the support standards for pharmaceutical patents are becoming increasingly strict. Some countries prohibit method of treatment claims in patents. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or create uncertainty. In addition, publication of information related to our current product and potential products may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to such product and potential products, including without limitation composition-of-matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection.\nOur intellectual property includes issued patents and pending patent applications for compositions of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, medical devices, synthetic methods and designs. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 58 patents and have 19 pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae. Patent protection for Rocklatan\u00ae includes the U.S. patents that cover Rhopressa\u00ae. The patents cover composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and had pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates. Our exclusive license regarding AR-15512 provides us with exclusive rights in patents covering pharmaceutical compositions of AR-15512 and its use in treating dry-eye in the United States and pending patent applications internationally. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2021, for AR-1105 we had two issued patents, one in the United States and one in Japan, which could provide coverage for AR-1105 in the United States and Japan through 2036. See \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property\u201d for further information about our issued patents and patent applications. With respect to our sustained-release implant AR-14034 SR, we have filed patent applications in the United States as well as internationally. Should these applications issue, they would provide patent protection through 2040.\nPatents that we own or may license in the future do not necessarily ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n\u2022our patents may not be broad or strong enough to prevent competition from other products that are identical or similar to Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae;\n\u2022there can be no assurance that the term of a patent can be extended under the provisions of Patent Term Extension (\u201cPTE\u201d) afforded by U.S. law or similar provisions in foreign countries, where available;\n\u2022our issued patents and patents that we may obtain in the future may not prevent generic entry into the markets for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae;\n\u2022we do not currently own or control foreign patents issued outside of Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan that would prevent generic entry into those markets for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae;\n\u2022we may be required to disclaim part of the term of one or more patents;\n\u2022there may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u2022there may be prior art of which we are aware, which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a patent claim, but which, nonetheless, ultimately may be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u2022there may be other patents issued to others that will affect our freedom to operate;\n\u2022if our patents are challenged, a court of competent jurisdiction could determine that they are invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022there might be a significant change in the law that governs patentability, validity and infringement of our patents that adversely affects the scope of our patent rights;\n\u2022a court of competent jurisdiction could determine that a competitor\u2019s technology or product does not infringe our patents; and\n\u2022our patents could irretrievably lapse due to failure to pay fees or otherwise comply with regulations or could be subject to compulsory licensing.\nOur competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may seek to market generic versions of Rhopressa\u00ae and/or Rocklatan\u00ae by submitting ANDAs to the FDA in which our competitors claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Our period of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States for each of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae with respect to their current indications will end on December 18, 2022. However, our competitors are permitted to file ANDAs to obtain permission to market generic versions of Rhopressa\u00ae and/or Rocklatan\u00ae as of December 18, 2021, if the ANDA contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement, also known as a Paragraph IV Certification. In such circumstances, we may need to file a lawsuit to delay FDA approval of such ANDA, to defend our patent rights and to try to maintain the longer-term benefits of patent-based market exclusivity. The filing of such a lawsuit would trigger a 30-month stay of regulatory approval of the ANDA filer\u2019s application. In addition, our competitors may file patent applications that may have an impact on our ability to make, use and sell products that contain Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae. Should such a competitor\u2019s patent application(s) issue, it is possible the competitor will allege that our making, using or selling of products containing Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae infringes such issued patents. In such circumstances, we may need to challenge such pending applications or issued patents, or perhaps come to a financial arrangement with the competitor.\nAlternatively, our competitors may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency having competent jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, ownership, priority, validity or enforceability. In that regard, third parties may challenge our patents in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and potential products. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.\nA significant portion of our intellectual property portfolio currently comprises pending patent applications that have not yet been issued as granted patents. If our pending patent applications fail to issue our business will be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend significantly on maintaining and expanding patent protection for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, as well as successfully defending our current and future patents against third-party challenges. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 160 issued patents and 135 pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions relating to Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, product candidates as well as previously discontinued product candidates and other proprietary technology. See \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property\u201d included elsewhere in this report for further information about our issued patents and patent applications. Our issued patents include 51 patents for composition of matter and method of use covering Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. These patents also cover Rocklatan\u00ae to the extent that Rhopressa\u00ae forms a part of Rocklatan\u00ae. The remainder of our portfolio is made up of patents covering product candidates, implants, medical devices, syntheses of compounds, previously discontinued product candidates and other proprietary technology and pending patent applications that have not yet been issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d).\nThere can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which such applications are pending. Even if patents do issue on any of these applications, there can be no assurance that a third party will not challenge their validity or enforceability, or that we will obtain sufficient claim scope in those patents to prevent a third party from competing successfully with our products.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. It may be difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of these intellectual property rights in any foreign jurisdictions. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and disrupt the commercialization of or increase the costs of commercializing Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. If patents issued to other companies contain blocking, dominating or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology and cease practicing those activities, including potentially manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe those patents. There could be issued patents of which we are not aware that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe.\nMoreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that claim or can be amended to claim subject matter that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates infringe. Competitors may file continuing patent applications claiming priority to already issued patents in the form of continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part applications, in order to maintain the pendency of a patent family and attempt to cover Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us for patent or other intellectual property infringement. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims asserted are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. If a court holds that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, unless we acquire or obtain a license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing one or more of our current products and potential products or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property, including trade secrets, of a third party, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities, biotechnology companies or other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed such intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with members of our senior management, but litigation may be necessary in the future to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Accordingly, these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Further, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, a proposal by the FDA to increase disclosure\nand make data more accessible to the public, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position and financial results.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights brought by or against us will be costly and time consuming and may adversely impact the price of our common stock.\nWe may be required to initiate litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property. In the United States, once an ANDA filer notifies us of their filing of a Paragraph IV Certification (i.e., a certification that the proposed generic product will not infringe our patents or that our patents are alleged to be invalid), we would have 45 days in which to bring a patent infringement lawsuit to delay regulatory review of the ANDA and to defend our IP rights. The filing of such a lawsuit would trigger a 30-month stay of regulatory approval of the ANDA filer\u2019s application. These lawsuits can be very time consuming and costly. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry generally. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\nIn any infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are resolved. Further, any claims we assert against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIn addition, our patents and patent applications could face other challenges, such as interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, re-examination proceedings, and other forms of post-grant review. Any of these challenges, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope of, any of our patents and patent applications subject to challenge. Any of these challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and would divert our management and scientific personnel\u2019s time and attention. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe will need to obtain regulatory approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely affect our business.\nWe assigned the trade names Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae to our now FDA approved products. The EC granted Centralised MAs for Rhopressa\u00ae (which will be marketed under the trade name Rhokiinsa\u00ae) in November 2019 and for Rocklatan\u00ae (which will be marketed under the trade name Roclanda\u00ae) in January 2021. Any other names we intend to use for our product candidates or any future product candidates will require approval from the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulatory authorities regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO or applicable non-U.S. regulatory authorities. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. Regulatory authorities outside the United States conduct their own investigations. If the FDA or applicable non-U.S. authorities object to any of our proposed product names for any product candidates or future product candidates, we may be required to adopt an alternative trade name.\nIf we do not obtain additional protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar foreign legislation extending the terms of our patents for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae, Rhokiinsa\u00ae, Roclanda\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA regulatory approval for Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. PTEs, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval by the FDA.\nThe application for PTE is subject to approval by the USPTO, in conjunction with the FDA. It takes at least six months to obtain approval of the application for PTE. A PTE application pursuant to 35 USC \u00a7156 (section 156) was filed February 8, 2018, seeking an extension of U.S. patent number 8,394,826 (the \u201c826 patent\u201d). The \u2018826 patent covers Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, and is presently expected to expire November 20, 2030, though the date may be extended if the \u2018826 patent PTE application is granted. To date there have been three official substantive actions on the \u2018826 patent PTE application. On September 18, 2018, the USPTO confirmed that 826 patent is eligible for PTE under section 156. On May 13, 2019, the FDA confirmed that Rhopressa\u00ae was subject to the required FDA approval and that the PTE application was filed timely. On April 14, 2021, the USPTO transmitted a copy of the PTE application to the FDA, stating the USPTO considers the \u2019826 patent to be eligible for PTE, making the FDA\u2019s determination of the applicable regulatory review period for Rhopressa\u00ae necessary. We expect the FDA and USPTO will complete the PTE application review in the next few years; however, it is not possible to predict with certainty when the PTE will become official, if at all.\nSimilarly, Europe provides a mechanism for patent owner to regain a portion of patent grant time lost due to product development and the European regulatory review process. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament, the patent owner may file for a Supplementary Protection Certificate (\u201cSPC\u201d) on a country-by-country basis in order to regain such lost patent grant time. Unlike the U.S. PTE, an SPC does not extend the expiration date of a European patent but is limited to the scope of the marketing authorisation. It provides to the patent owner all of the rights the European patent provided to the patent holder for up to five (5) years from the expiration of the European patent. Upon approval of Rhokiinsa\u00ae in Europe, Aerie has filed for SPCs in a number of E.U. countries for EP Patent 3053913. SPCs have been granted in Italy, Spain, Ireland and The Netherlands, and are presently pending in Germany, France, Belgium and Great Britain. Upon approval of Roclanda\u00ae in Europe, Aerie filed for SPCs in a number of EU Countries and Great Britain for EP Patent EP3461484. SPCs have been granted in France, Italy, Spain, Ireland, and the Netherlands, and are pending in Germany, France, Belgium and Great Britain.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have limited revenue and may never become profitable.\nWe have a limited operating history and began commercializing our first product, Rhopressa\u00ae, in the United States in April 2018, and our second product, Rocklatan\u00ae, in the United States in May 2019. We have never been profitable and only have two products approved for commercial sale. Even though we received FDA approval, began commercial sales for these two products in the United States and received the Centralised MAs for Rhokiinsa\u00ae and Roclanda\u00ae from the EC, we are still in the process of obtaining additional regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States and there is no guarantee that either product will be approved in any such jurisdictions.\nOur ability to generate product revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022maintain an acceptable price for each of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in the United States;\n\u2022set acceptable net prices for our glaucoma products outside the United States that allow for adequate profitability, in a stand-alone or partnered environment;\n\u2022set an acceptable price for any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, and obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers;\n\u2022manufacture or obtain commercial quantities of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022successfully market and sell Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, in the United States and other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022successfully complete clinical development, and receive regulatory approval, for our product candidates and any future product candidates.\nOur net product revenue may be impacted by our estimates for discounts and allowances, which estimates are based on current contractual and statutory requirements, invoices from CMS for the company funded portion of the coverage gap, known market events and trends, industry data, forecasted customer mix and lagged claims. In addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, commercialization and manufacturing, we are unable to precisely predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations for a number of reasons, including if we are required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even though we have begun\ncommercial sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, we are still incurring and anticipate continuing to incur significant costs associated with commercialization activities.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. Although we have generated revenues from the sales of our products, even if we were able to continue to generate revenues from our products and to generate revenues from product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could materially impair our ability to raise funds, expand our business or continue our operations.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses until such a time when Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae generate adequate net revenues to cover operating costs and expenses, if at all.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception in June 2005. Our net losses were $74.8 million, $183.1 million and $199.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,153.9 million.\nInvestment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have devoted the majority of our historical financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. We have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible debt, including the issuance of $316.25 million of Convertible Notes in September 2019 as well as the issuance and sale of common stock pursuant to our registration statements on Form S-3 and prior \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales agreements. Our products will continue to require significant marketing efforts and substantial investment to maintain and increase revenues. Any product candidates or future product candidates will require the completion of regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they can provide us with any revenue.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to continue to be significant in connection with our ongoing and planned activities. In addition, as we launched Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and expect to commercialize both products internationally, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased manufacturing, selling and marketing expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses until our products generate adequate commercial revenue to render Aerie profitable. These losses have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity, financial position, cash flows and working capital.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. Through December 31, 2021, we have raised net proceeds of approximately $987.2 million from our IPO, debt financings and the issuance of common stock. We received a $50.0 million payment associated with the First Santen Agreement in the fourth quarter of 2020. In January 2022, we received a $90.0 million payment from Santen in connection with the Second Santen Agreement. We may need to obtain additional financing to fund our future operations. Additionally, we may need to obtain additional financing to conduct additional trials for the approval of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae in additional jurisdictions or any product candidates or future product candidates, and for completing the development of any additional product candidates or technologies and executing our international expansion strategy. Moreover, our fixed expenses, such as rent and other contractual commitments, are substantial and are expected to increase in the future, and we also expect to incur increased expenses as we expand our employment base.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the amount of sales and other revenues from Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, including the selling prices for such potential products and the availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022selling and marketing costs associated with Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u2022our commercial success with our commercialized products and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we have established and may establish;\n\u2022cash requirements of any future acquisitions and/or the development of other product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022the progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals that may be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the time and cost necessary to increase internal manufacturing capabilities or arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022costs of any new business strategies;\n\u2022the costs of operating as a public company;\n\u2022the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; and\n\u2022the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments of $139.8 million as of December 31, 2021, the $88.0 million upfront payment and the $2.0 million supplemental upfront payment associated with the Second Santen Agreement, both received from Santen in January 2022, and expected cash flows will be sufficient to support the product commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae through at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing. We also intend to use these funds for general corporate purposes, including our clinical, regulatory and commercialization efforts beyond the United States, further development of other potential pipeline opportunities including activities to support execution of our dry eye and retina programs, our external business development efforts and our manufacturing activities, including the operation of our manufacturing plant in Ireland.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may need to finance future cash needs through additional financings or other available sources. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization or manufacturing efforts. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operating requirements is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on a number of assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. Our inability to obtain additional funding when we need it could seriously harm our business.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Convertible Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $316.25 million in principal amount of indebtedness as a result of the issuance of the Convertible Notes which mature on October 1, 2024. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Interest payments, fees, covenants and restrictions under agreements governing our current or future indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022impairing our ability to successfully continue to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae and commercialize any product candidates or future product candidates, which would prevent us from generating a source of revenue and becoming profitable;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate\nrequirements, and making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to any such additional financing;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with no debt obligations or with debt obligations on more favorable terms;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; and\n\u2022diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows and ability to satisfy our obligations under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and any other indebtedness.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, the agreements governing indebtedness that we may incur in the future may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and the terms of our then-existing borrowing arrangements may limit our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nNoteholders may require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing any of our then-existing borrowing arrangements may restrict our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. If we fail to repurchase Convertible Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required, we will be in default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and may be in default under any other then-existing borrowing arrangements. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under any of our then-existing agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the Convertible Notes and any other then-existing indebtedness.\nThe accounting method for the Convertible Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nThe accounting method for reflecting the Convertible Notes on our balance sheet, accruing interest expense for the Convertible Notes and reflecting the underlying shares of our common stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition.\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 470, Debt, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion option of the Convertible Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our consolidated balance sheets and as a discount to the Convertible Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. In addition, under the treasury stock method, if the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share assuming that all the Convertible Notes were converted and that we issued shares of our common stock to settle the excess. However, if reflecting the Convertible Notes in diluted earnings per share in this manner is anti-dilutive, or if the conversion value of the Convertible Notes does not exceed their principal amount for a reporting period, then the shares of common stock underlying the Convertible Notes will not be reflected in our diluted earnings per share.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d), which eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. This would reduce non-cash interest expense, and thereby decrease net loss (or increase net income). Additionally, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares and the if-converted method will be required.\nASU 2020-06 became effective beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, including any interim periods within that fiscal year. Under ASU 2020-06, the Convertible Notes will be subject to the \u201cif-converted\u201d method for calculating diluted earnings per share. Accordingly, under the \u201cif-converted\u201d method, diluted earnings per share will be calculated assuming that all of the Convertible Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. This new method of calculating earnings per share may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nIf any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Convertible Notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Convertible Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Convertible Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates are expected to modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock, the Convertible Notes or other securities or instruments of ours (if any) in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes or following any issuance of a notice of redemption with respect to the Convertible Notes). Any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the market price of the shares of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the past resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If any option counterparty becomes subject to proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under any capped call transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, the counterparty may fail to deliver the shares of common stock required to be delivered to us under the capped call transactions and we may suffer adverse tax consequences or experience more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties.\nWe may sell additional debt or equity securities at any time, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business.\nIn order to raise additional funds to support our operations, business strategies and growth, or if we decide based on ongoing forecast updates, new strategic initiatives, market conditions or for other reasons that additional financings are desirable or needed, we may sell additional equity or debt securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDetermining our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty.\nThe computation of income tax provisions is complex, as it is based on the laws of federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under U.S. GAAP. Our provision for income tax can be materially impacted, for example, by the geographical mix of our profits and losses, changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative or judicial developments, transfer pricing policies, tax audit determinations, changes in our uncertain tax positions, changes in our capital structure and leverage, changes to our transfer pricing practices, tax deductions attributed to equity and other compensation and limitations on such deductions and changes in our need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. In addition, relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates and reduced cash flows than otherwise would be expected. For these reasons, our actual income taxes may be materially different than our provision for income tax.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nIf we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), or similar state provisions, we may be subject to annual limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards. An ownership change is, as a general matter, triggered by sales or acquisitions of our stock in excess of 50% on a cumulative basis during a three-year period by persons owning 5% or more of our total equity value.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $635.1 million and $616.3 million, respectively. If not utilized, U.S. federal NOLs that arose before 2018 and state NOLs begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2031 and 2023, respectively. U.S. federal NOLs that arose on or after January 1, 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely to be utilized against future income, but can only be used to offset a maximum of 80% of our federal taxable income in any year. As of December 31, 2021, we also had foreign NOLs of $66.0 million which are available solely to offset taxable income of our foreign subsidiaries, subject to any applicable limitations under foreign law. Our U.S. federal, state and foreign NOLs are included as deferred tax assets and have been fully offset by a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021.\nChanges to the United States tax laws could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income and non-income-based taxes in the United States under federal, state and local jurisdictions and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without advance notice. For example, in 2021, there have been numerous changes proposed to U.S. federal income tax law, including an increase to the U.S. corporate tax rate, modifications of the provisions addressing taxation of international business operations and the imposition of a global minimum tax. Such changes may adversely affect our effective tax rates, cash flows, financial position and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income, if any, in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with any of our determinations including as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions and the statutory domiciles of our intellectual property. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates and reduced cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nThe widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions, including the disruption of global supply chains. In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a new strain of COVID-19 and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared\nCOVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and its variants continue to negatively impact the global economy, disrupt global supply chains and workforce participation due to curtailment of travel and \u201cstay at home\u201d restrictions by various governments worldwide and create significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Although state and local governments began to ease COVID-19 restrictions in the second quarter of 2021, as we have seen with the onset of the Delta and Omicron variants, the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected demand for our products because quarantines or other government restrictions on movements have caused and continue to cause changes in demand. While a majority of eye-care professionals\u2019 offices returned to in-person appointments in the second half of 2021, patients may still not visit their eye-care professionals for an extended period of time due to logistical issues or safety concerns, resulting in fewer new diagnoses or prescriptions as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to progress. Additionally, patients may continue to change the quantities in, or the frequency with, which they order our products. Our sales force is also limited in its ability to meet with current and potential prescribers, which may negatively affect sales. Our current efforts to utilize virtual tools to remain in contact with eye-care professionals, in addition to face-to-face meetings, may not be adequate to address any negative effect on sales. If the overall economy is negatively affected, including by entering into a recession, current and potential patients may alter their spending patterns and may have less disposable income with which to spend on prescriptions, amongst other changes. The changes in eye-care professional and patient behavior have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe progress of the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our clinical operations and regulatory approvals. We are in the process of advancing our products towards approval in jurisdictions outside the United States and advancing our product candidates towards regulatory approval. We also have applications for regulatory approval pending. We cannot be certain as to how the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our clinical operations or the timing of regulatory approvals.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of COVID-19 and its variants; the continued availability and efficacy of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 and its variants; the effect on eye-care professionals and patients and demand for our products; our ability to sell and provide our products, including as a result of people staying home, the health and safety of our employees and any closures of our offices and our manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, our eye-care professionals\u2019 offices and regulatory agencies, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, any adverse conditions discussed above in the financial and credit markets due to the market conditions described above may limit the availability of liquidity or increase the cost of such liquidity, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. COVID-19, and the volatile economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or new variants of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this section, including our ability to achieve market acceptance of our products, our competitiveness, our reliance on third parties, our dependence on key personnel, our risks related to security breaches and other cybersecurity risks and our manufacturing capabilities. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our access to sources of liquidity, our financial condition and the price of our common stock.\nWe depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. We are highly dependent on our senior management team and our scientific founders, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or scientific team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. In particular, the loss of a member of our senior management could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. We do not currently carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of members of executive management. The competition for qualified members of senior management and other personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified members of senior management and other personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. Furthermore, as we continue to expand our commercialization efforts, particularly on a global scale, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified members of senior management, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nWe also rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe are currently searching for new members of our senior management team and there are no assurances concerning the timing or outcome of our search.\nWe are currently searching for a new Chief Financial Officer, a head of commercial operations and a Chief Medical Officer; however, the marketplace for attracting senior executives, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, is competitive and identifying and hiring a new executive may take several months or longer. Although we anticipate a smooth transition, any changes to members of our senior management may be disruptive to our operations, including by diverting our Board of Directors and management\u2019s time and attention and a decline in employee morale. There are no assurances concerning the timing or outcome of our search for new members of our senior management team. If there are any delays in this process, our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, it may not be feasible to pass through price increases to patients. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients, payers and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers, collaboration partners or licensees to remain in business or otherwise develop, manufacture or supply product. Failure by any of them to remain in business could affect our ability to manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, or develop additional product candidates or technologies.\nIf we engage in acquisitions or licenses in the future, we will incur a variety of costs and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or licenses.\nWe may attempt to acquire or license businesses, technologies, services, products, product candidates or implants in the future that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. For example, in October 2017, we acquired the rights to use PRINT\u00ae technology and certain other assets from Envisia. Further, in August 2018 we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaborative Research, Development, and License Agreement with DSM, which provides for (i) a worldwide exclusive license for all ophthalmic indications to DSM\u2019s polyesteramide polymer technology, (ii) continuation of the collaborative research initiatives through the end of 2020, including the transfer of DSM\u2019s formulation technology to Aerie during that time and (iii) access to a preclinical latanoprost implant. Additionally, in late 2019 we acquired Avizorex, a Spanish ophthalmic pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of dry eye disease. We expended considerable capital in\nconnection with these acquisitions. While we believe these acquisition will provide material benefits to our business, to date, there has been no commercial return. We have no present agreement regarding any material acquisitions. If we do undertake any additional acquisitions or additional licenses, the process of integrating an acquired or licensed business, technology, service, product or product candidate into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from our core business. In addition, we may fail to retain key executives and employees of the companies we acquire, which may reduce the value of the acquisition or give rise to additional integration costs. Future acquisitions or licenses could result in additional issuances of equity securities that would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. Future acquisitions or licenses could also result in the incurrence of debt, actual or contingent liabilities or the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have limited experience identifying, negotiating and implementing acquisitions or licenses of additional businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates, which is a lengthy and complex process. The market for acquiring or licensing businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates is intensely competitive, and other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may also pursue strategies to acquire or license businesses, technologies, products or product candidates that we may consider attractive. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or licensing of additional businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire or license the rights to additional businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all. In particular, any product candidate that we acquire or license may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities.\nBusiness interruptions could delay the development of our potential products and our manufacturing activities and could disrupt our potential sales.\nOur principal executive office and research facility is located in Durham, North Carolina, our regulatory, commercial support and other administrative activities are located in Irvine, California and our clinical, finance and legal operations are located in Bedminster, New Jersey. We also lease space for a manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, and small offices in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Japan. We are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as severe storms, and other adverse events that could disrupt our operations. We carry limited insurance for natural disasters and other adverse events, and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, cyber-attacks or other security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs, sales force, collaborators and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, malware, ransomware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information including e-mails and other electronic communications. In addition, an employee, supplier, collaboration partner or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs, manufacturing activities and/or commercialization efforts, damage our reputation, provide competitors with valuable information and subject us to additional liabilities, including criminal penalties and civil sanctions. We have not been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents to date which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our business, but the actions we take to prevent or detect the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology networks and infrastructure may be insufficient to prevent or detect a major cyber-attack or other cyber incident in the future.\nIn addition, there is a risk created by our lack of redundancy across our systems and if any of these events were to occur, this could result in a loss of materials that would be difficult to replace, such as proprietary information including intellectual property and business information and/or customer, supplier, employee, business partner and, in certain instances, patient personally identifiable information. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae, and similar events relating to their systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and the further development of any product candidates or future product candidates could be delayed.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, data about our clinical participants, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. Any access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, all of which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and international privacy and security regulations. For example, HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) took effect in January 2020 and became enforceable in July 2020. The CCPA created new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as the word is broadly defined in the law) and placed increased privacy and security obligations on many organizations that handle personal information of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosure to consumers about such companies\u2019 data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers a new right to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provides consumers with a new cause of action for certain data breaches. Additionally, California voters voted to approve the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) in November 2020, which modifies the CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CCPA and CPRA may impact our business activities and increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states, such as Virginia and Colorado, which have instituted privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, and all of which may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.\nWith our increasing international presence, we are also subject to the laws of jurisdictions outside the United States. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements, which could increase the costs incurred by us in complying with such laws. The E.U. member states, Switzerland, Japan and other countries have established, or are in the process of establishing, legal frameworks for privacy and data security that impose significant compliance obligations with which our customers, our vendors or we must comply. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes strict requirements on data controllers and processors of personal data. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements, including requirements relating to processing sensitive data (including health, biometric and genetic information), obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. In addition, the GDPR grants individuals an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union, including to the United States and other regions.\nThe GDPR imposes new fines and penalties for a breach of requirements, which may result in significant fines of up to 4% of annual global revenues, or \u20ac20.0 million, whichever is greater. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that has increased our cost of doing business and required us to change our business practices, in particular as regards data processing in the context of clinical trials. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we were required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules, although there is a risk that the measures will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within our business will not be fully compliant with the new procedures. If\nthere are any breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and our systems to implement such disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, our insurance may be inadequate and we may incur substantial liability.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates. We face an additional risk from our commercial sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and will face further risk to the extent we commercialize any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved. We maintain primary product liability insurance and excess product liability insurance that cover our clinical trials, and we have and plan to maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for commercial sale of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved. Historically, the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable. Although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to claims in connection with our clinical trials or commercial use of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved, for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate, and the cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial.\nFor example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u2022decreased demand for Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022significant costs to defend resulting litigation;\n\u2022diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022loss of revenue; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe increased our insurance coverage when each of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae received FDA approval. However, the product liability insurance we will need to maintain in connection with the continued commercial sales of Rhopressa\u00ae and Rocklatan\u00ae and any product candidates or future product candidates if and when they receive regulatory approval, may be unavailable in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. In addition, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, it could inhibit the continued commercial production and sale of Rhopressa\u00ae or Rocklatan\u00ae or any product candidates or future product candidates if and when they obtain regulatory approval, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nAdditionally, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe failure by the U.S. Congress to timely approve a budget for the federal government and its agencies, including the FDA, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn an annual basis, the U.S. Congress must approve budgets that govern spending by the federal agencies, including the FDA. If Congress cannot agree on a budget, or if the President vetoes a budget approved by Congress, then the federal government may be shut down and non-essential federal employees, including many FDA employees, may be furloughed. Such a shutdown would prevent the FDA from performing many of its duties, which are crucial to our business. For example, on December 22, 2018, due to a lapse in appropriations for the federal government, most of the federal government was shut down, including many functions of the FDA, and most federal employees were furloughed for several weeks. Any future government shutdown could affect, among other things, the FDA approval process of one or more of our product candidates or future product candidates, or the ability of the FDA to inspect a manufacturing facility supporting our business, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile. The following factors, in addition to other factors described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022overall company profitability and ability to generate positive cash flows;\n\u2022our ability to maintain adequate product supply to meet demand at an acceptable per unit cost;\n\u2022our ability to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain successful collaboration arrangements;\n\u2022the results of our testing and clinical trials for our product candidates and future product candidates;\n\u2022announcements of therapeutic innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022any adverse changes to our relationships with manufacturers, suppliers or licensees;\n\u2022the results of our efforts to develop, acquire or license additional product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations;\n\u2022any intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the capital markets;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles; and\n\u2022the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have historically experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Further, any decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly.\nAny securities litigation could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nA putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors in 2015, which has now concluded. If our stock price experiences volatility, we may be the subject of additional securities litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Monitoring and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus on our business activities. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nCertain of our existing stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and may be able to influence or control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur officers and directors, and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, beneficially own approximately 24.3% of our common stock as of December 31, 2021. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with ownership concentration. Some of our stockholders may be able to influence or determine matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nThis may also prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that other stockholders may feel are in their best interest, and certain of our existing stockholders may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nAdditionally, under certain circumstances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy that we have in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, corporate opportunities that are presented to certain entities or their affiliates and certain other related parties (whether or not any such person is our director). These provisions will apply even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, we expect that only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors for the foreseeable future.\nThe requirements associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In addition, subsequent rules implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Market may also impose various additional requirements on public companies. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our corporate governance standards, disclosure controls and financial reporting and accounting systems to continue to meet our reporting obligations. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company, which could subject us to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nWe are subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), which requires that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, among other additional requirements. Compliance with Section 404 is costly and time consuming for management and could result in the detection of internal control deficiencies. Moreover, if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. Any failure to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports that we are required to file with the SEC under the Exchange Act could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The Nasdaq Global Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022establishing a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022allowing the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022requiring the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal our bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the\nmembers of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14238, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AERI"}
