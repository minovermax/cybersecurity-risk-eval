RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is challenged by a changing environment that involves many known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The risks described below discuss factors that have affected and/or could affect us in the future. There may be others. We may be affected by risks that are currently unknown to us or are immaterial at this time. If any such events did occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. Our future results may also be impacted by other risk factors listed from time to time in our future filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nRisks Related to Our Revenues\nFuture revenues and earnings are dependent on the award of new contracts which we do not directly control.\nDue primarily to the favorable operating results of GPS, we have generated income for nine fiscal years in a row. As described in the risks presented below, our ability to maintain profitable operations depends on many factors including the ability of the power industry services business segment to continue to obtain significant new EPC projects and to complete its projects successfully.\nOur dependence on a few customers could adversely affect us.\nThe size of the energy plant construction projects of our power industry services segment frequently results in a limited number of projects contributing a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues each year. Should we fail to replace major projects that are completed by GPS in the future with new projects, future revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur dependence on large construction contracts may result in uneven financial results.\nOur power industry service activities in any one fiscal quarter are typically concentrated on a few large construction projects for which we use the percentage-of-completion accounting method to determine corresponding revenues. To a substantial extent, our contract revenues are recognized as services are provided based on the amount of costs incurred. As the timing of equipment purchases, subcontractor services and other contract events may not be evenly distributed over the terms of our contracts, the amount of total contract costs may vary from quarter to quarter, creating uneven amounts of quarterly consolidated revenues. In addition, the timing of contract commencements, suspensions and completions may exacerbate the uneven pattern. As a result of the foregoing, future amounts of consolidated revenues, cash flow from operations, net income and earnings per share reported on a quarterly basis may vary in an uneven pattern and may not be indicative of the operating results expected for any other quarter or for an entire fiscal year, thus rendering consecutive quarter comparisons of our consolidated operating results a less meaningful way to assess the growth of our business.\nActual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.\nTo prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments as of the date of such financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, we recognize revenues over the life of a contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project. We review and make necessary revisions to such costs on a monthly basis. In addition, contract results may be impacted by our estimates of the amounts of change orders that we expect to receive and our assessment of any contract claims that may arise.\nUnder our accounting procedures, we measure and recognize a large portion of our revenues under the percentage-of-completion accounting methodology. This methodology allows us to recognize revenues and contract profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred. The effects of revisions to revenues and estimated costs are recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated, and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material. Given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nOther areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:\n\u00b7 the identification of the significant beneficiary of entities in which we may have variable interests;\n\u00b7 the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\n\u00b7 the assessment of the value of goodwill and recoverability of other purchased intangible assets;\n\u00b7 provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances associated with deferred income tax assets;\n\u00b7 accruals for estimated liabilities, including losses and expenses related to legal matters;\n\u00b7 the adequacy of allowances for uncollectible accounts and notes receivable; and\n\u00b7 the determination of stock-based compensation expense amounts.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from those estimates, which may impact our profits.\nFailure to successfully operate our power industry services business will adversely affect us.\nThe operations of our power industry services business, which substantially consist of the operations conducted by GPS, represent a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and profits. The revenues of this reportable business segment were approximately $587 million, $388 million and $377 million, or 87%, 94% and 98% of consolidated revenues, for Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively. Income before income taxes for these three years were $117 million, $82 million and $70 million, respectively. Moreover, at any time, GPS and APC have a limited number of construction contracts. For example, five EPC projects of this reportable segment represented 97% of the aggregate value of our contract backlog at January 31, 2017 and provided 70% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017. Our inability to successfully manage and grow our power industry services business will adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial condition.\nBacklog may be an uncertain indicator of future revenues as it is subject to unexpected adjustments, delays and cancellations.\nAt January 31, 2017, the total contract backlog of the power industry services business was $1.0 billion. Projects awarded to us may remain included in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations or scope adjustments or foreign currency fluctuations may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog that could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually earn. Should any unexpected suspension, termination or delay of the work under such contracts occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, construction work was suspended indefinitely on APC\u2019s largest project at the time when the project owner was unable to secure debt financing in the wake of the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union on June 23, 2016 (\u201cBrexit\u201d), resulting in the project being removed from our backlog. In addition, as of January 31, 2017, our contract backlog included one EPC contract for which activity has been temporarily suspended by the project owner primarily due to delays in the project owner obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. We cannot guarantee that future revenues projected by us based on our backlog at January 31, 2017 and subsequently awarded projects will be realized or will result in profitable operating results.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop energy plant projects could result in write-offs and the loss of future business.\nIt is not uncommon in our industry that EPC contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of executing a project or program for a client, such as a government agency or a commercial enterprise. Such entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program.\nFor example, Moxie, an unaffiliated power plant project development firm, formed a special purpose entity during Fiscal 2015, Moxie Freedom LLC (\u201cMoxie Freedom\u201d), for the purpose of developing a natural gas-fired power plant project in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. We signed a development loan agreement with Moxie Freedom with a commitment to lend up to $6 million in funding; we were granted the exclusive right to provide EPC services for the project and we received a commitment to be paid a success fee upon the successful completion of the development effort by Moxie Freedom. In early November 2015, Moxie sold a substantial portion of its ownership interest in Moxie Freedom and we received full repayment of our development loans, the related accrued interest and our share of the development success fee, and GPS received a full notice-to-proceed with activities pursuant to the corresponding EPC contract. Approximately 31% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017 was earned pursuant to the EPC contracts that were obtained as a result of our supporting the three power plant development projects sponsored by Moxie. With the final completion of two of the EPC contracts during Fiscal 2017, approximately 28% of our contract backlog as of January 31, 2017 relates to the remaining EPC contract obtained through these efforts.\nThere are no assurances that we will benefit from successful future development efforts. Failure to obtain the opportunity to support future power plant development projects or the failure of any project developer firms supported by us to complete the development of power plants in the future would result in the loss of future potential construction business and could result in write-off adjustments related to the balance of any project development costs or amounts lent to potential project owners. During Fiscal 2017, we recorded a provision for uncollectible accounts in the amount of $1.1 million related to outstanding loans made by us to an energy project developer as the likelihood of the projects successfully being financed decreased. Similar adjustments related to future developmental projects could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for a future reporting period.\nRisks Related to Our Operational Execution\nWe may experience reduced profits or losses under contracts if costs increase above estimates.\nGenerally our business is performed under contracts that include cost and schedule estimates in relation to our services. Inaccuracies in these estimates may lead to cost overruns that may not be paid by our clients thereby resulting in reduced profits or losses. If a contract is significant or there are one or more events that impact a contract or multiple contracts, cost overruns could have a material impact on our reputation or our financial results, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. At GPS, nearly 100 percent of the dollar-value of our current backlog relates to fixed-price contracts, where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources and time necessary for these types of contracts, or fail to complete these contracts within the timeframes and costs to which we have agreed, there could be a material impact on our financial results as well as our reputation. Risks under our contracts which could result in cost overruns, project delays or other problems may include:\n\u00b7 difficulties related to the performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;\n\u00b7 delays in the scheduled deliveries of machinery and equipment ordered by us or a project owner;\n\u00b7 changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals;\n\u00b7 unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;\n\u00b7 insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed in the future to record, track, forecast and control costs and schedules;\n\u00b7 unforeseen increases in or failures to properly estimate the costs of raw materials, components, equipment, labor or warranties, or the inability to obtain resources when needed;\n\u00b7 delays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions;\n\u00b7 incorrect assumptions related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions;\n\u00b7 work stoppages and other declines in the productivity of construction workers; and\n\u00b7 modifications to projects that create unanticipated costs or delays.\nThese risks tend to be exacerbated for longer-term contracts because there is increased risk that the circumstances under which we based our original cost estimates or project schedules will change with a resulting increase in costs. In many of these contracts, we may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred and, if a project is not executed on schedule or if the contractually required performance of a plant is not achieved, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. In addition, these losses may be material and can, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively impacted.\nWe try to mitigate these risks by reflecting in our overall cost estimates the reasonable possibility that a number of different and potentially unfavorable outcomes might occur. If certain risk scenarios transpire and cost overruns occur on a project, it is possible that our overall cost estimate can absorb the cost overruns. There are no assurances that our estimates will be sufficient, which may lead to decreased profits or losses. In some cases, as certain risk scenarios are eliminated or are diminished significantly, and we estimate that the likelihood of unforeseen cost overruns has reduced, we may increase the estimated gross margin on the project by decreasing the remaining overall cost estimate.\nWe may be involved in litigation proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes which could reduce our profits.\nFrom time to time, we, our directors and/or certain of our current officers may be named as parties to lawsuits. Typically, it is not possible to predict the likely outcome of legal actions with certainty, and an adverse result in any lawsuit against us could have a material adverse effect on us. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, proceedings may occur over several years and the outcomes are typically difficult to predict. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming\nand would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations over multi-year periods, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe engage in engineering and construction activities for large and complex energy plant facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties. In addition, the nature of our business results in owners, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been, and may be in the future, named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. These claims generally arise in the normal course of our business.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face. When it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of any liability may exceed our policy limits or self-insurance reserves. Further, we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. Our management liability insurance policies are on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposures, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits and self-insurance reserves or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us, which claims may reduce our future profits and cash available for operations.\nIn the future, we may bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of which may result in additional cost. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we have used working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a negative impact on our liquidity and profitability in the future.\nOur continued success requires us to retain and hire talented personnel.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service and performance of the members of our current executive team and the senior management members of our businesses, including William Griffin, Jr., the chief executive officer of GPS, and John Roberts, the chief executive officer and founder of TRC. We cannot be certain that any such individual will continue in such capacity or continue to perform at a high level for any particular period of time. Our ability to operate productively and profitably, particularly in the power services industry and particularly related to the various new EPC projects recently awarded to GPS, may be limited by the loss of key personnel or our inability to attract, employ, retain and train skilled personnel necessary to meet our future requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain experienced management teams and an adequately skilled group of employees necessary to operate efficiently, to execute EPC contracts successfully and to support our future growth strategy. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees in the future, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.\nThe shortage of skilled craft labor may negatively impact our ability to execute on our EPC contracts.\nThere is a risk that our EPC project schedules become unachievable or that labor expenses will increase unexpectedly as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. The inability to hire and retain qualified skilled employees in the future, including workers skilled in the construction crafts, could negatively impact our ability to complete our EPC contracts successfully.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses as our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous.\nWe often work on large-scale and complex projects, sometimes in geographically remote locations. Our project sites can place our employees and others near large and/or mechanized equipment, high voltage electrical equipment, moving vehicles, dangerous processes or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. Further, regulatory changes implemented by\nOSHA or similar government agencies could impose additional costs on us. We maintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our Company. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries. The failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability, and adversely impact our ability to obtain projects in the future.\nOur dependence upon third parties to complete many of our contracts may adversely affect our performance under future energy plant construction contracts.\nCertain of the work performed under our energy plant construction contracts is actually performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and most of the materials (such as copper, concrete and steel) needed to complete our construction projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired.\nIf the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially when we are operating under a lump sum or a fixed-price type construction contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, we may be required to source these supplies, equipment or services on an expedited basis or at a higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. In addition, if a subcontractor fails to pay its subcontractors, suppliers or employees, liens may be placed on our project requiring us to incur the costs of reimbursing such parties in order to have the liens removed.\nIf we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project, we could incur additional costs to fulfill such obligations.\nIn some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee a customer that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes provide that the project, when completed, will also achieve certain performance standards. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance standards, we may be held responsible for cost impacts to the customer resulting from any delay or modifications to the plant in order to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform substandard work. If these events would occur, the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project.\nFuture bonding requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete for new energy plant construction projects.\nOur construction contracts frequently require that we obtain payment and performance bonds from surety companies on behalf of project owners as a condition to the award of such contracts. Historically, we have had a strong bonding capacity. As of January 31, 2017, the contract value of future work covered by outstanding performance bonds was $0.8 billion. However, under standard terms in the surety market, surety companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds.\nCurrent or future market conditions, changes in our performance or financial position, changes in our surety\u2019s assessment of its own operating and financial risk or larger future projects could cause our surety company to decline to issue, or substantially reduce the amount of, bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These actions can be taken on short notice. If our surety company were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, joint venturing with other construction firms, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit, or cash. We may be unable to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption, reduction or other alteration in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.\nIt can be very difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.\nAs part of business operations we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of the world\u2019s leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted.\nIf we are unable to collect amounts billed to project owners as scheduled, our cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nMany of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design, engineering, procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable contract milestone. As a result, under these types of arrangements, we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment. If the project owner determines not to proceed with the completion of the project, delays in making payment of billed amounts or defaults on its payment obligations, we may face delays or other difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies. Such problems may impact the planned cash flows of affected projects and result in unanticipated reductions in the amounts of future cash flows from operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Regulatory Environment\nSoft demand for electrical power may cause deterioration in our financial outlook.\nThe sluggish economic recovery in the United States may continue to result in a lackluster demand for electrical power in the United States. Soft demand growth for power and a future slowdown in the anticipated pace of the retirement of coal-fired and/or nuclear power plants could result in the delay, curtailment or cancellation of future gas-fired power plant projects, thus decreasing the overall demand for our services and adversely impacting our financial outlook. In addition, project owners may experience difficulty in raising capital for the construction of power-generation plants and renewable fuel production facilities due to substantial limitations on the availability of credit and other factors. In general, if overall economic conditions do not improve steadily, the demand for our EPC contract services may be adversely affected.\nFuture construction projects may depend on the continuing acceptability of the hydraulic fracturing process in certain states.\nThe viability of the gas-fired power plant projects that we work on are based substantially on the availability of inexpensive natural gas supplies provided through the use of hydraulic fracturing drilling techniques. Certain technological advancements led to the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) and horizontal drilling techniques in recent years in order to reach natural gas and oil deposits previously trapped within shale rock formations deep under the earth\u2019s surface. The new supplies have transformed the oil and gas industry in the United States. In particular, the new supplies of natural gas have depressed the price of natural gas in the United States, making the operation of natural gas-fired power plants more economically appealing. However, the process of fracking uses large volumes of highly pressurized water to break-up the shale rock formations and to free the trapped natural gas and oil. This process is controversial due to concerns about the disposal of the waste water, the possible contamination of nearby water supplies and potential seismic events. As a result, not all states permit the use of fracking. Should future evidence confirm the concerns, or should a major contamination or seismic episode occur in the future, the use of fracking may be suspended, limited, or curtailed by state and/or federal regulation. As a result, the supply of inexpensive natural gas may not be available in the future and the economic viability of gas-fired power plants may be jeopardized. A reduction in the pace of the construction of new gas-fired power plants would have a significantly adverse effect on our future operating results.\nIf the future shutdown of existing coal-fired power plants slows, the demand for our construction services could decline.\nMany coal-fired power plants have been shut down or are scheduled for shut down as the demand for coal as a power source has been adversely affected by the inexpensive supply of natural gas in the United States, as well as by regulations regarding air pollution adopted or under development by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d). These regulations included the Clean Power Plan rules, finalized in 2015 regarding carbon dioxide emissions from certain new and existing fossil-fuel power plants and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (\u201cMATS\u201d). MATS requires large coal-fired electricity generators to meet stricter emission standards by incorporating emission control technologies in existing power facilities. Some power plant operators have reportedly decided that retrofitting units to meet the MATS standards would be cost-prohibitive and are choosing to retire older coal-fired units.\nOn the other hand, the policies and actions of newly elected or appointed government officials may present risks to our power industry services business. The nonresidential sector of the domestic construction industry may receive a significant boost from significant increases in spending on our country\u2019s infrastructure, particularly transportation. However, the expected pro-business tilt of the new administration may continue to result in the reduction or elimination of environmental rules and regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. By executive order, roll-back of the climate initiatives of the previous administration has begun. Should the federal government\u2019s anti-pollution regulations be eliminated or stalled by the new administration, overturned or modified by the courts, repealed by Congress, or otherwise weakened or eliminated, the rate of coal-fired power plant shutdowns may slow, thereby reducing the number of future gas-fired power plant construction opportunities for us in the future.\nWe could be subject to compliance with environmental laws and regulations that would add costs to our business.\nOur operations are subject to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps to ensure compliance with environmental laws, however, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nGrowing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. For example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions that could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. Legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. However, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, which could have a positive impact on our business. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers.\nThe inability of our customers to receive or to avoid delay in receiving the applicable regulatory approvals relating to projects may result in lost or postponed revenues for us.\nThe commencement and/or execution of many of the construction projects performed by our power industry services segment are subject to numerous regulatory permitting processes. Applications for permits may be opposed by individuals or environmental groups, resulting in delays and possible denial of the permits. There are no assurances that our project-owner customers will obtain the necessary permits for these projects, or that the necessary permits will be obtained in order to allow construction work to proceed as scheduled. For example, during Fiscal 2017 we have not received a full notice to proceed related to our EPC contract at the Exelon West Medway II Facility due to delays in regulatory approvals and new activity on this project was suspended. Failure to commence or complete construction work as anticipated could have material adverse impacts on our future revenues, profits and cash flows from operations.\nOur revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by a reduced level of activity in the hydrocarbon industry.\nPrevious declines in oil or natural gas prices or activities in the hydrocarbon industry could adversely affect the demand for our services. The availability of natural gas in great supply has caused, in part, low prices for natural gas in the United States, though gas prices have partially rebounded in Fiscal 2017. Regardless, the overall relatively low prices for oil and natural gas has resulted in cutbacks in exploration, extraction and production activities which may lead to reductions in future supplies of natural gas and increased prices. Continued rising natural gas prices may adversely impact the favorable economic factors for project owners as they consider the construction of natural gas-fired power plants in the future. In addition, critical financing for new power plants and major improvement to existing plants may continue to be unavailable as certain project owners suffer from reduced current and projected oil and natural gas revenues. Any reduction in the number of future power plant project construction or improvement opportunities could adversely affect our power industry service business.\nIf financing for new energy plants is unavailable or too expensive, construction of such plants may not occur and we may lose any investment made in the projects.\nHistorically, natural gas-fired power plants have been constructed typically by large utility companies. However, to a large extent, the construction of new energy plants, including alternative and renewable energy facilities, is conducted by independent power producers including private investment groups. This type of project owner may be challenged in obtaining financing necessary to complete the project. Should debt financing for the construction of new energy facilities, including alternative or renewable energy plants, not be available or become cost prohibitive, equity investors may not be able to invest in such projects, thereby adversely affecting the likelihood that GPS and APC will obtain contracts to construct such plants. In March 2017, The Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds rate to a range between 0.75% and 1.00%, and it is expected to raise it further in the future. The increased rate is an indicator that The Federal Reserve wants to slow the pace of economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing. Increased borrowing costs could reduce the rate of return on a planned power plant project and result in it not being built. For example, construction work was suspended during Fiscal 2017 on APC\u2019s largest project when the project owner was unable to secure debt financing in the wake of Brexit, resulting in losses being incurred by us on the project in Fiscal 2017.\nWe periodically see new business opportunities that contemplate our making an investment in the ownership of a new project, at least during the development phase of the project, in order to improve the probability of an EPC contract award. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider the opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks. Failure of a project owner to obtain such financing will make it likely that we will not recover the amount of any investment made by us in the project.\nIntense global competition for engineering, procurement and construction contracts could reduce our market share.\nWe serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These competitors may include Bechtel Corporation, Fluor Corporation, Black & Veatch, SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Skanska AB, Kiewit Corporation as well as other large companies located overseas in countries like Spain and Korea. In addition, it appears that the world\u2019s largest natural gas turbine manufacturers are intent on developing turnkey capabilities for power plant project owners, particularly for overseas markets. These and other competitors are multi-billion dollar companies with thousands of employees. Competing effectively requires substantial financial resources, the availability of skilled personnel and equipment when needed and the effective use of technology. Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk that we may have losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in our markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges and replace completed projects with new customers and projects with desirable margins, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in future revenues and profits.\nCyber-security breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact our ability to operate.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on a number of information technology systems both for us and for others. Various privacy and security laws require us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure. In addition, we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information (whether it be ours or a third party\u2019s information entrusted to us) from disclosure. Our computer systems face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyber-attacks, phishing and other\nsecurity incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our clients and other business partners. While we endeavor to maintain industry-accepted security measures and technology to secure our computer systems, these systems and the information stored on these systems may still be subject to threats. A party who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, or could cause damage or interruptions to our systems. Any of these events could damage our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are periodically under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions.\nOf significance, the loss of the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (\u201cDPAD\u201d) could increase our effective income tax rate. Under the current Internal Revenue Code, a corporation is allowed a DPAD equal to the specified percentage for the tax year of the corporation\u2019s qualified production activities income for the tax year, subject to certain limits. For the years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the favorable income tax effects of permanent differences included significant amounts relating to the DPAD. Speculations about future income tax reform often cite the need for a reduction of the current federal tax rate of 35%. Should any future reduction of the corporate income tax rate be offset by reductions or even the eliminations of certain corporate tax expenditures like the deferral of the active income of controlled foreign corporations or the DPAD, the net change could result in an increase to our overall effective federal income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.\nForeign currency risks could have an adverse impact on our revenues, earnings and/or backlog.\nCertain of the contracts of APC subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, our operational cash flows and cash balances, though predominately held in U.S. dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our project contracts globally and meet transactional requirements. In the future, we may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives as hedging instruments. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk and, as a result, our profitability on certain projects could be adversely affected.\nOur monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of APC\u2019s backlog may from time to time increase or decrease due to foreign currency volatility. The future amounts of revenues and earnings of foreign subsidiaries could be affected by foreign currency volatility. Revenues, costs and earnings of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar appreciates against a foreign subsidiary\u2019s non-U.S. dollar functional currency, we will report less consolidated revenues, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars than we will if the U.S. dollar depreciates against the same foreign currency or if there is no change in the exchange rate.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We may operate in parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our\nemployees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention away from other aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\nThe acquisition of The Roberts Company may not be successful, which could result in significant future losses.\nOn December 4, 2015, we acquired TRC, which is principally an industrial fabricator and constructor serving both light and heavy industrial organizations primarily in the southern United States. We paid $0.5 million to acquire the member interests and assumed approximately $15.6 million in bank debt obligations, which we paid off. Since the acquisition, we have advanced an additional $22.5 million to enable TRC to finish the work on the loss contracts, to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes. TRC historically has been primarily a profitable company that incurred a net loss in the period leading up to the acquisition date primarily due to TRC taking on large contracts that resulted in significant losses that were largely unrecoverable. With the reengagement and leadership of its founder, John Roberts, our financial support and the substantial completion of these loss contracts, we acquired TRC with the belief that it is positioned to succeed in the future. For Fiscal 2017, TRC generated revenues and pre-tax income of $79.0 million and $4.4 million. Moreover, it completed the pre-acquisition large contracts that resulted in significant losses, and no cash advances have been made to TRC since March 2016. However, there can be no assurances that TRC will succeed in the future or to sustain profitable operations. The failure of TRC to achieve sustained profitable operating results will adversely affect our future consolidated operating results, including gross profits, gross profit percentages and cash flows from operations.\nThe future operating results of Atlantic Projects Company may not be favorable, which could adversely affect our consolidated revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nOn May 29, 2015, we acquired APC, a company located near Dublin in the Republic of Ireland for consideration valued at $8.8 million, net of the amount of cash acquired. APC provides turbine, boiler and large rotating equipment installation, commissioning and outage services to original equipment manufacturers, global construction firms and plant owners worldwide. Most importantly, the expected growth of this business in the foreseeable future is dependent on the construction of new biomass-fired and natural gas-fired power plants in the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries throughout the world. APC\u2019s primary market is the United Kingdom. In the wake of Brexit, the resulting sterling pound drop, financial market uncertainty and recessionary pressures will likely impact the availability of financing for future power plant developments in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future. It is anticipated that this process, when completed, could result in greater regulatory complexities and possibly result in more restrictive business activities between the United Kingdom and the European Union. In addition, Brexit may cause general disruption to the global economic markets. Brexit may adversely impact our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, employees and subcontractors, and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. APC\u2019s second largest market has been the Middle East, which has experienced decreased project activity due to capital constraints resulting from decreased oil revenues. APC incurred an operating loss for Fiscal 2017. In addition, APC recorded an impairment loss of $2.0 million during the second quarter, which amount represented approximately 49% of its goodwill and which has been reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings for Fiscal 2017. If existing projects struggle and the anticipated new project opportunities do not occur or are delayed or if APC fails to win work associated with such new projects, the future operating results of APC, including revenues, earnings and cash flows, could be adversely affected with corresponding adverse impacts on our future consolidated operating results.\nFuture acquisitions and/or investments may not occur which could limit the growth of our business.\nWe are a holding company with no operations other than our investments in GPS, TRC, APC and SMC. We want to make additional acquisitions and/or investments that would provide positive cash flow to us and value to our stockholders. However, additional companies meeting these criteria and that provide products and/or services in growth industries similar to ours and that are available for purchase at attractive prices are difficult to find. Discussions with the principal(s) of potential acquisition targets may be protracted and ultimately terminated for a variety of reasons. Further, due diligence investigations of attractive target companies may uncover unfavorable data, and the negotiation and consummation of acquisition agreements may not be successful.\nWe cannot readily predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions or the capital we will need for these transactions. However, it is likely that any potential future acquisition or strategic investment transaction would require the use of cash and/or shares of our common stock as components of the purchase price. Using cash for acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future may depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, the strength of our future operating results and financial condition as well as conditions in our business, and the amount of outside financing sought by us. These factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to use shares of our common stock as future acquisition consideration may be limited by a variety of factors, including the future market price of shares of our common stock and a potential seller\u2019s assessment of the liquidity of our common stock. If adequate funds or the use of our common stock are not available to us, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of desirable acquisitions or other investment opportunities that would benefit our business.\nThe integration of companies that are acquired in the future may not be successful.\nEven if we do complete acquisitions in the future, acquired companies may fail to achieve the results we anticipate including the expected gross profit percentages. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquired companies with our other operations without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other important operational matters;\n\u00b7 difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;\n\u00b7 the potential disruptions to our current business; and\n\u00b7 unforeseen difficulties in the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\nIf one of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems, the reputation of our entire Company could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests, the issuance of sizable amounts of debt and the incurrence of contingent liabilities. In summary, integrating acquired companies involves a number of special risks which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our profits.\nWhen we acquire a business, we typically record goodwill equal to the excess amount paid for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. Generally accepted accounting principles require that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. The balances of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are evaluated at least annually for impairment. The amounts of intangible assets that do have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. However, should poor performance or any other condition indicate that the carrying value of a business or long-lived asset may have suffered impairment, a determination of fair value is required to be performed in the period that such a condition exists. If the carrying value of a business or of an individual purchased intangible asset is found to exceed the corresponding fair value, an impairment loss is recorded.\nThe aggregate carrying amount of goodwill, other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives and long-lived purchased intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2017 was approximately $43.1 million, or approximately 7% of total consolidated assets and 15% of consolidated net assets attributable to our stockholders.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the current year, we performed full assessments of the carrying values of goodwill for APC and TRC, and we determined that no impairment loss had incurred. Future assessments of these assets, as well as our long-lived assets, may be conducted if we identify indications of impairment, as occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2017 for APC. As discussed previously, in the quarter we recorded an impairment loss related to the goodwill of APC in the amount of $2.0 million which amount was approximately 49% of the total. Should the operating results of GPS, APC, TRC or any future acquired company experience unexpected deterioration, we could be required to record impairment losses related to purchased intangible assets. Impairment losses, if any, would be recognized as operating expenses and would adversely affect future profitability.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur acquisition strategy may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur business strategy contemplates the strategic acquisition of other businesses. We anticipate that future acquisitions will require cash and issuances of our common stock. To the extent we are required to pay cash for any acquisition, we anticipate that we would be required to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing. Equity financing would result in dilution for our then current stockholders. Stock issuances and financing, if obtained, may not be on terms favorable to us and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders at the time(s) of these stock issuances and financings.\nFuture stock option exercises may dilute the ownership of the Company\u2019s current stockholders.\nThe average of the monthly closing prices for our common stock for the year ended January 31, 2017 was $48.08 per share and the closing price of our stock on the last day of the fiscal year was $73.75 per share. During the year ended January 31, 2017, the exercise of stock options by our employees and directors resulted in the issuance of 621,750 shares of our common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $25.57 per share; the aggregate intrinsic value of such shares was approximately $18.4 million. As of January 31, 2017, there were outstanding options to purchase 707,150 shares of our common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $39.04 per share. Based on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock as of January 31, 2017, the aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding options was approximately $24.5 million. Future exercises of options to purchase shares of common stock at prices below prevailing market prices for such stock may result in ownership dilution for current stockholders, which is reflected, in part, in our weighted average number of shares outstanding on a diluted basis.\nOur officers, directors and certain unaffiliated stockholders have substantial control over the Company.\nAs of January 31, 2017, our executive officers and directors as a group owned approximately 7% of our voting shares including an aggregate of 322,000 shares of common stock that may be purchased upon the exercise of stock options held by our executive officers and directors (and deemed exercisable at January 31, 2017), 402,411 shares of common stock beneficially owned by Rainer H. Bosselmann (our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer) and 316,150 shares beneficially owned by William F. Griffin, Jr. (a founder and the current chief executive officer of GPS and member of our Board of Directors). An additional 3.4% of the outstanding shares are controlled by Allen & Company entities (\u201cAllen\u201d). One of our independent directors is an officer of Allen. In addition, four other stockholders owned approximately 23.2% of our voting shares in total. These groups of stockholders may have significant influence over corporate actions such as an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, the consummation of any merger, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and may substantially influence the election of directors and other actions requiring stockholder approval.\nWe may not pay cash dividends in the future.\nAnnually, our board of directors evaluates the Company\u2019s ongoing operational and financial performance in order to determine what role strategically aligned dividends should play in creating shareholder value. Due primarily to the continued strong performance of GPS and the associated cash flows, we paid regular and special cash dividends of $0.70 and $0.30 per share, respectively, for a total of $1.00 per share during calendar year 2016, a regular cash dividend in the amount of $0.70 per share during the calendar year 2015 and we paid special cash dividends during the calendar years 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in the amounts of $0.70, $0.75, $0.60 and $0.50 per share, respectively. There can be no assurance that the evaluations of our board of directors will result in the payment of cash dividends in the future.\nAs our common stock is thinly traded at times, the stock price may be volatile and investors may have difficulty disposing of their investments at prevailing market prices.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE stock exchange and trades under the symbol AGX. Despite the listing on this national stock exchange, our common stock may trade thinly and sporadically at times and no assurances can be given that a larger market will ever develop, or if developed, that it will be maintained.\nWe may issue preferred stock with rights that are superior to our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and to designate the terms of the preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock by us could\nadversely affect the rights of holders of common stock by, among other factors, establishing dividend rights, liquidation rights and voting rights that are superior to the rights of the holders of the common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could delay, prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Among other things, as stated above, our board of directors may issue up to 500,000 shares of our preferred stock and may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of these shares of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law limits transactions between us and persons that acquire significant amounts of our stock without approval of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 64785, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "AGX"}
