Also,\nnet interest\nincome in\nfuture periods\nmight be\naffected by\nour\ninvestment in callable securities because decreases in interest rates might\nprompt the early redemption of such securities.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR could adversely affect\nthe interest rates we pay or receive, could prompt regulatory questions, result\nin costly disputes about relevant alternative interest rates and require costly systems and\nanalytics changes.\nIn July\n2017, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the\n\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, officially announced that\nit\nintended to\nstop persuading\nor compelling\nbanks to submit\ninformation\nto the administrator\nof LIBOR after\n2021. In March\n2021, the FCA\nconfirmed that publication of the\novernight and one\nmonth, three-month, six-month, and twelvemonth U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will\ncease or become\nno longer\nrepresentative\nof the market\nthe rates\nseek to measure\n(i.e., non-representative)\nimmediately\nafter June\n30, 2023,\nand all other U.S. Dollar\nLIBOR settings,\nincluding the one week\nand two-month U.S. Dollar\nLIBOR settings,\nbecame non-representative\nimmediately after December 31, 2021. The Federal Reserve, the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency,\nand the FDIC\nalso released\nsupervisory guidance encouraging banks to\ncease entering into\nnew contracts that\nuse U.S.\nDollar LIBOR as\nreference rate as\nsoon as\npracticable and in any event by\nDecember 31, 2021. Banking regulators in the U.S. and\nglobally have increased regulatory scrutiny\nand\nintensified\nsupervisory\nfocus of\nfinancial\ninstitutions\nLIBOR transition\nplans, preparations,\nand readiness.\nSignificant amounts of\nloans, mortgages,\nsecurities, derivatives, and\nother\nfinancial instruments are\nreferenced to\nLIBOR, and\nany\ninability of\nmarket\nparticipants and\nregulators to\nsuccessfully introduce benchmark\nrates\nto\nreplace\nLIBOR\nand\nimplement effective\ntransitional\narrangements\nto address the\ndiscontinuation\nof LIBOR could result\nin disruption\nin the financial\nmarkets. Therefore,\nregulators\nand market participants\nin various jurisdictions\nhave been working to recommend\nalternative\nrates to LIBOR for each respective\ncurrency\nthat are compliant\nwith the International\nOrganization\nof Securities\nCommission\u2019s standards\nfor transaction-based\nbenchmarks.\nIn the U.S.\nthe Alternative Reference Rate\nCommittee (\u201cAARC\u201d), a\ngroup of\nmarket participants convened by\nthe Federal\nReserve, identified the\nSecured Overnight\nFinancing\nRate (\u201cSOFR\u201d)\nas its recommended\nalternative\nto LIBOR. The\nFederal Reserve\nstarted publishing\nthe SOFR\nin April 2018. The\nSOFR is a\nbroad measure of the cost\nof overnight borrowings collateralized\nby Treasury securities in the repurchase\nagreement market. During 2021, the ARRC\nrecommended using the\nChicago Mercantile Exchange Group\u2019s (\u201cCME\u201d) forward-looking\nTerm\nSOFR\nrates\nfor\ncash\nproducts\nand\nderivatives, limited\nto\nend-users\nhedging\ncash\nproducts.\nAn\nend-user\nis\ndescribed\nas\nany\ncounterparty\nto the underlying\ncash product,\nsuch as a\nborrower, lender,\nor guarantor.\nThese parties\nmay enter\ninto Term SOFR\nrates swaps,\ncaps, swaptions,\nor other derivatives\nto hedge cash product\nexposures.\nThe market transition\naway from LIBOR to an\nalternative\nreference\nrate is complex and could\nhave a range of adverse effects\non our business, financial\ncondition, and\nresults of operations.\nIn particular, any\nsuch transition\ncould:\n\u25cf\nAdversely\naffect the\ninterest\nrates received\nor paid on,\nthe revenue\nand expenses\nassociated\nwith or the\nvalue of\nthe Corporation\u2019s\nLIBOR-based assets\nand\nliabilities, which include\ncertain variable\nrate\nloans, primarily\ncommercial and\nconstruction loans,\nprivate\nlabel\nMBSs,\nthe\nCorporation\u2019s\njunior\nsubordinated\ndebentures,\nand\ncertain\nother\nfinancial\narrangements\nsuch\nas\nderivatives.
