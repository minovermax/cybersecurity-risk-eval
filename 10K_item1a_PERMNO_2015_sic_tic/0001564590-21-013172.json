{"cik": "1162112", "company": "RigNet, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors that could materially affect our business, financial position, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our common stock are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC.\nThe announcement and pending agreement to merge with Viasat may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nUncertainty relating to the pending Viasat Merger could have an adverse effect on our employees, customers, partners and other third parties that may materially disrupt key business activities and may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Moreover, we are subject to various additional risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Viasat Merger, including:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the conditions to the closing of the Viasat Merger may not be satisfied or waived, including that the required approval of our stockholders may not be obtained;\n\u2022\nuncertainty relating to the pending Viasat Merger may cause current and prospective customers to consider alternatives and potentially change suppliers;\n\u2022\npotential adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles following the Viasat Merger;\n\u2022\nthe significant diversion of internal resources and key employees\u2019 and management\u2019s attention due to the pending Viasat Merger;\n\u2022\nlegal proceedings that have arisen challenging the Viasat Merger and the related transactions contemplated by the Viasat Merger Agreement may require us to incur significant legal fees and expenses, and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could delay or prevent the completion of the Viasat Merger;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions imposed on our business and operations under the Viasat Merger Agreement may prevent us from pursuing opportunities without Viasat\u2019s approval or taking other action that we might\nhave undertaken in the absence of the proposed Viasat Merger, which may interfere with our ability to effectively respond to competitive pressures, execute business strategies and meet financial goals;\n\u2022\nthe Viasat Merger Agreement contains customary provisions that restrict our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the Viasat Merger and that may discourage potential competing acquires from considering or proposing an alternative transaction that may provide a higher value to our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe required regulatory approvals from governmental entities (U.S. and non-U.S.) may delay the completion of the Viasat Merger or result in the imposition of conditions that would allow Viasat to terminate the Viasat Merger Agreement in certain circumstances.\nAny failure of the pending Viasat Merger to be completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price.\nEach of our and Viasat\u2019s obligations to complete the Viasat Merger is subject to a number of conditions in the Viasat Merger Agreement, including among others (i) the adoption of the Viasat Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock; (ii) the expiration or termination of review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the receipt of certain other material regulatory consents and approvals; (iv) the authorization for listing of shares of Viasat common stock to be issued in the Viasat Merger on Nasdaq; (v) the absence of any court order or regulatory injunction prohibiting completion of the Viasat Merger; (vi) subject to specified materiality standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party; (vii) compliance by each party in all material respects with covenants; (viii) the absence of any effects that have constituted or resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a material adverse effect with respect to either party; and (ix) the receipt by each party of closing tax opinions. There can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the Viasat Merger will be satisfied within the timeframe specified in the Viasat Merger Agreement or at all.\nRegulatory and governmental authorities may impose conditions on the granting of the required regulatory approvals, including divestitures of certain assets or businesses, which may result in extended negotiations among these entities, Viasat and us, which may delay completion of the Viasat Merger and increase the risk that the Viasat Merger may not be completed.\nIf the Viasat Merger is not completed, our stock price could decline to the extent that our current share price reflects an assumption that the Viasat Merger will be completed. Furthermore, if the Viasat Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Viasat Merger, and may of the fees and costs are payable by s regardless of whether the Viasat Merger is completed;\n\u2022\nwe could be required to pay a termination fee of up to $5.5 million to Viasat under circumstances described in the Viasat Merger Agreement, including a circumstance in which our board of directors changes its recommendation concerning the approval of the Viasat Merger or if the Company were to receive an alternative proposal;\n\u2022\nthe failure to complete the Viasat Merger may result in adverse publicity, negatively impact the reputation of the Company in the capital markets and investment community, and result in critical responses from our customers, partners and other third parties;\n\u2022\nlegal proceedings have been instituted against us, our directors and other relating to the Viasat Merger and related transactions;\n\u2022\nany disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Viasat Merger, including any adverse changes to our relationships with customers, vendors and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Viasat Merger is not completed;\n\u2022\nwe may experience employee departures; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments, have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity. These effects have adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as for our services. The collapse in demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, coupled with oil oversupply, has had and is reasonably likely to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the demand for our services. The decline in our customers\u2019 demand for our services has had and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is not yet known, we are closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic on commodity demands and on our customers, as well as on our operations and employees. These effects have included and may continue to include adverse revenue, net income, and Adjusted EBITDA effects; disruptions to our operations; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers and suppliers.\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results continue to be affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions taken by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. COVID-19 may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nRecently, we have experienced increased cancellations of platform space agreements which are having a material adverse effect on our Gulf of Mexico infrastructure.\nWe enter License of Platform Space (LOPS) agreements with operators of platforms in the Gulf of Mexico to place equipment necessary for our WiMax, microwave and LTE networks in the Gulf of Mexico. These agreements allow the operator to cancel the agreement with short notice periods if the operator intends to decommission or abandon the platform. The downturn in demand for oil and gas triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a high number of notifications of cancelations of our LOPS agreements. When LOPS agreements are cancelled, we have to relocate equipment to another platform in order to maintain our network infrastructure. These moves increase our costs and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, we cannot guarantee that alternative platform space is available for all required network moves resulting from the cancellation of LOPS agreements. Failure to secure alternative space could result in gaps in our network coverage or degraded network performance and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA large portion of our business fluctuates with the level of global oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, as a large portion of our customers are energy-related.\nDemand for our remote communication services and collaborative applications depends on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas. Our business will suffer if these expenditures decline. Our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas depends largely upon prevailing market conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nthe supply, demand and price expectations for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure levels of producers of oil and natural gas and drilling contractors;\n\u2022\nthe addressable market and utilization rate for drilling rigs and oilfield services;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or non-OPEC countries to influence and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide political, regulatory and economic environment;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics, or other \u201cacts of God\u201d affecting significant oil-importing countries, including the recent worldwide outbreak of coronavirus and its effect on travel, commerce and industry;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which alternative energy sources displace oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technology.\nOil and gas prices are volatile, and the oil and gas business is cyclical. When prices are perceived as being too low to generate acceptable returns, companies reduce expenditures for exploration and production. At the start of 2020, oil prices significantly decreased largely as a result of the Saudi state producer, Aramco, reducing crude pricing in response to a split and price war with Russia. Following the Saudi reduction in pricing, Brent crude spot prices declined steeply to a mid-30 dollar per barrel range. As a result, we have seen a material decline in the demand for our products and services and significant pressure on the prices we can charge. Furthermore, our customers have experienced declines in their cash flows which has led to delays in payment, or nonpayment, for our products and services. Commodity price declines and increased volatility have particularly affected our customers\u2019 budgets for offshore capital investments and expenditures, which has had a material and adverse effect on our addressable market.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the volatility of oil and gas prices and has caused delays, supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions that have impacted the oil and gas industry and certain projects in the Asia Pacific region.\nThese conditions have had and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nContinued growth in satellite capacity has adversely affected our MCS segment revenues.\nNew digital applications are driving demand growth for bandwidth in our core MCS segment. However, we also continue to see growth in available satellite capacity and expect that growth to continue over the intermediate-term. While we have experienced bandwidth price declines from our satellite suppliers, due to competition for our oil and gas customers and declining capital investment by our customers, we have passed much of our realized savings onto our customers. If satellite capacity growth continues to outstrip demand growth or is expected to continue, we may be forced to reduce our prices in the MCS segment further, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to timely collect receivables, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nSome of our customers in the oil and gas industry have been through bankruptcy proceedings or other restructurings. In addition, as the global oil and gas industry has continued to experience reduced activity, many of our customers have unilaterally extended their payment practices. We actively manage our credit exposures and accounts receivable collections, but restructuring or insolvency proceedings by our largest customers, or continued lengthening of payment cycles could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we fail to keep pace with these changes or if access to telecommunications in remote locations becomes easier or less expensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nRecently some remote communications providers are offering the use of LTE and high-throughput satellite (HTS) service, instead of or in addition to the conventional Ku-band, Ka-Band, and C-band satellite space segments used today. Our business may be harmed if our competitors are more successful than us in introducing LTE and or HTS services to meet customer needs.\nIf alternative telecommunications services to remote locations become more readily accessible or less expensive, our business will suffer. New disruptive technologies could make our VSAT-based networks or other services obsolete or less competitive than they are today, requiring us to reduce the prices that we are able to charge for our services or causing us to undergo expensive transitions to new technologies. We may not be able to successfully respond to new technological developments and challenges or identify and respond to new market\nopportunities, services or solutions offered by competitors. In addition, our efforts to respond to technological innovations and competition may require significant capital investments and resources. Furthermore, if we invest either organically or through acquisition in new technology and any such technology is not successful, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur business model has historically required significant capital expenditures to win new business. To the extent we are unsuccessful in shifting some of those capital expenditures to our customers or suppliers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nHistorically we have purchased much of the equipment to provide new services to our customers and recovered the cost of that equipment through service charges over the life of the contract. This business model requires large capital expenditures at the start of new customer contracts. We are attempting to shift some of the upfront capital expenditures to our customers and/or suppliers through new contractual arrangements with them. However, we may be unsuccessful in shifting those required capital investments to our customers and/or suppliers. To the extent we are unable to finance growth capital or to change our business model, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. Furthermore, future new technologies could be capital intensive and may require capital expenditures in order for us to remain competitive.\nFailure to obtain and retain skilled personnel could impede our business and growth strategy.\nOur operations depend on a highly qualified executive, sales, technical, development, service and management team. Competition for personnel talent in the artificial intelligence, machine learning, engineering and cybersecurity industry is intense, and these roles are critical to our operation. Failure to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event that our cybersecurity measures fail or are otherwise inadequate, our systems or reputation may be damaged which could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with data privacy requirements applicable to us could result in costly regulatory enforcement actions and the imposition of significant penalties.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to run our business and our customers rely on our networks and security measures in running their businesses. Given that our customers own and operate critical infrastructure, the nature of cybersecurity threats are advanced and persistent. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such attacks. If such incidents or attacks do occur, they could have a material impact on our systems including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our facilities, equipment and data. In addition, we could be adversely affected by the theft or loss of confidential customer data or intellectual property. With the acquisition of Cyphre, we now market our cybersecurity services as an expertise. A successful cyberattack against us or one of our cybersecurity customers may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against these events or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, customer loss and litigation, caused by these events or the failure or inadequacy of our security systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn a widely publicized attack in 2020, SolarWinds software, which we utilize for certain network management and monitoring functions, was compromised by alleged foreign State Actors. The Company learned of this hack on December 14, 2020 when the owner of SolarWinds notified the public. By December 15, 2020, we determined that we had not updated to the infected patch because of our policy of waiting to implement patches until they had been thoroughly market tested. Nevertheless, we installed the fix and upgraded to the latest version of SolarWinds in January 2021. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully avoid future attacks which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our policy of waiting for patches to be market tested could lead to other vulnerabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is complex and evolving, and we believe it is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government entities and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. Internationally, certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we must\ncomply. For example, the European Union has issued the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to anyone doing business in Europe. In general, GDPR sets a higher bar for privacy compliance, including new data subject rights, new mandatory security breach notification requirements, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments and extensive record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with GDPR can have significant consequences, including substantial fines and reputational damage. We continue to analyze the GDPR in respect of its burden and applicability to our global business operations. We may fail to comply with any of these requirements, and compliance with these requirements may increase our compliance burden and costs.\nAttempts to enter new verticals may not be successful.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we attempt to enter new verticals, and offer new and innovative products and services. We have and intend to enter new verticals and launch new products. Our attempts to enter new verticals and launch new products and services may not be successful, costing us money and diverting management time and attention.\nOur customers may terminate many of our contracts on short notice without penalty, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomers may switch service providers without incurring significant expense relative to the annual cost of the service. Our contracts generally provide that in the event of prolonged loss of service or for other good reasons, our customers may terminate service without penalty. In addition, some of our contracts may be terminated by our customers for no reason and upon short notice. Terms of contracts typically vary with a range from short-term call out work to five years. Work orders placed under such agreements may have shorter terms than the relevant customer agreement. As a result, we may not be able to retain our customers through the end of the terms specified in the contracts, resulting in harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. These ratios may limit our capacity to finance our growth strategy and operations. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our Credit Agreement, including as a result of events beyond our control, technical or other default could result, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions, including restricting the payment of cash dividends under default and maintaining certain financial covenants such as a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio requirement then steps down to 2.75 for all remaining quarters after June 30, 2021. If any default occurs related to these covenants that is not cured or waived, the unpaid principal and any accrued interest can be declared immediately due and payable. The RCF under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company.\nIf we approach our covenant limits, we will be limited in our ability to finance capital and operating expenditures and any acquisitions we may pursue in the future. Should this happen we would pursue additional financing, through either debt and / or equity offerings. We may incur financing and legal fees attempting to amend our current Credit Agreement, or in pursuing other debt and or equity financing. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur growth strategy may require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms.\nTo support our growth strategy, we expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures. Many of our customers now demand newer HTS services, requiring significant capital expenditures to upgrade equipment. We expect to fund capital expenditures, with cash generated by operations and borrowings under RCF or capital markets transactions; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities. The issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Furthermore, raising equity capital would generally dilute existing stockholders. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur strategy of moving up the technology stack entails entering new business lines that could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to move up the technology stack, that is to leverage our existing network to provide application layer solutions to our network customers. In 2017, we began reporting a new segment, Apps & IoT, to capture results from these new OTT services, such as SCADA, MetOcean, BlackTIE, CyphreLink and Advanced Video Intelligence. In addition, in 2018, we acquired Intelie which provides us a real-time machine-to-machine learning offering, Intelie LIVE. We continue to expect to invest in new lines of business, new products and other new initiatives to generate revenue. Our customers may not adopt some of our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Furthermore, efforts at establishing new lines of business could divert management attention from our core MCS network and Systems Integration businesses. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe rely on third parties, particularly satellite owners, to provide products and services for the operation of our business. Failures by third-party providers have caused, and in the future could cause, service interruptions, harm our business and reputation and result in loss of customers and revenue.\nA significant part of our operations and growth depends on third-party providers delivering reliable communications connections, networks, equipment, maintenance, repair and satellite transponder capacity, subjecting our business, reputation and customer revenue to risks beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\ntelecommunications, satellite manufacturing, equipment or control system errors, faults or failures;\n\u2022\nsaturation of communication connection points, networks and third-party facilities;\n\u2022\nin-orbit risks for satellites including malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris;\n\u2022\nlack of communication service alternatives, including failure of satellite providers to timely replace aging satellites with more modern technology and updated capacities;\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\npower loss;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\nunauthorized access or security risks; and\n\u2022\nsabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism or war.\nOur results in 2019 and 2018 were negatively impacted by certain satellite outages and interruptions by certain of our providers. These incidents caused RigNet to lose forecasted revenues and to experience increased costs as we had to make alternative arrangements for our customers. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer future satellite outages or that any potential future outage will not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Under most of our contracts with satellite service providers, our satellite service providers do not indemnify us for such loss or damage to our business resulting from certain risks, including satellite failures. If any potential claims result in liabilities, we could be required to pay damages or other penalties.\nIf we lose the right to use or upgrade any products or services provided by a third-party, our customers could experience delays or be unable to access our own services until we can obtain and integrate equivalent technology. There might not always be commercially reasonable hardware or software alternatives to the third-party infrastructure, products and services that we currently license for our operations. Any such alternatives could be more difficult or costly to replace than the third-party infrastructure, products and services we currently use, and integration of the alternatives into our operations could require significant work and substantial time and resources. Any delays or failures associated with our operations may injure our reputation with customers and potential customers and result in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure of our Line-of-Site network or loss of platform access could materially impact our results of operations.\nOur microwave network is a Line-of-Site (LOS) system that operates by relaying microwave communications from one microwave site to another that must be within visible sight. Furthermore, our LTE network is built on the existing infrastructure of our microwave network. We secure access to our customers\u2019 offshore platforms to house our LOS, microwave and LTE network, but the agreements are subject to termination for various reasons, including decommissioning of the platform. When a microwave site on a microwave relay is rendered inoperable subsequent dependent sites can also be rendered inoperable. As such the risk of a LOS, microwave or LTE site being rendered inoperable by weather, technical failure, loss of access to an operator\u2019s platform space or other means will likely negatively affect other dependent microwave sites. We do not insure for loss of a LOS, microwave or LTE site or business interruption caused by the loss of such a site as we believe the cost of such insurance outweighs the risk of potential loss, so the loss of a LOS, microwave or LTE site or any business interruption could require us to spend significant capital to restore network service and / or harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and export control laws that have stringent compliance standards.\nWe are subject to a number of applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States as well as comparable laws of other countries. We cannot provide services to or in certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control of the United States Department of the Treasury or the United States Department of Commerce unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations. If our customers move their sites into countries subject to certain sanctions, we may not be able to serve them, in which case, our revenues will be adversely impacted, and we may incur additional costs. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws that, generally, prohibit bribes or unreasonable gifts to governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, and more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. In certain countries, we engage third-party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in dealings with government officials, such as customs agents, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in penalties or sanctions being assessed against us.\nMany of our potential customers are resistant to new solutions and technologies, which may limit our growth.\nAlthough there is a strong focus on technology development within the oil and gas industry, some of the companies in the upstream oil and gas industry are relatively conservative and risk-averse with respect to adopting new solutions and technologies in the area of remote communications. As a result of the sustained downturn in oil and gas prices, many of our customers focus on price rather than the value new technologies bring them, further slowing the uptake of new solutions and technologies. Some drilling contractors, oil and gas companies and oilfield service providers may choose not to adopt new solutions and technology, such as our OTT offerings, which may limit our growth potential.\nSI projects are heavily dependent on cost, productivity, schedule and performance management.\nWe account for SI contracts using accounting rules for construction-type contracts. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include the price and availability of labor, equipment and materials, productivity, as well as the time necessary to obtain approvals and permits. If we make inaccurate estimates, or if we find errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, changes in local labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of equipment and materials, or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform, or changes in foreign exchange rates, then cost overruns may occur. We may be required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. In accordance with the accounting guidance, we would record a cumulative adjustment to reduce the margin previously recorded on the related project in the period a change in estimate is needed. If the contract is significant, or we encounter issues that impact multiple contracts, cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, SI contracts can require performance bonds, surety bonds and similar instruments. Any inability to secure required performance bonds, surety bonds and similar instruments, could limit business. Although we have not previously had performance bonds, surety bonds and similar instruments called, should such instruments be called in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of any of these customers would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we continue to diversify our customer base, we still receive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of large customers, among them being Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Valaris Plc, Transocean Ltd, Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP Plc, Baker Hughes Company, Halliburton Company, Bechtel Corporation, and Seadrill Ltd.. Although none of these customers represents more than 10% of our annual revenue, should one or more of these customers terminate or significantly reduce their business with us and we were not able to replace such revenue, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. As our top customers are concentrated in energy, should there be any adverse impact on the energy business that caused our customers to reduce demand for our services our financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nWe expect both product and pricing competition to persist and intensify. Increased competition could cause reduced revenue, price reductions, reduced profits and loss of market share. Our industry is characterized by competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology. Our primary global competitor is Speedcast International Ltd. Panasonic, through its ITC Global subsidiary, Marlink and Tampnet Inc. have begun to expand their presence as active providers of communications services to the oil and gas, mining and maritime markets. We also compete with regional competitors in the countries in which we operate. In addition, in certain markets outside of the U.S., we face competition from local competitors that provide their services at a lower price due to lower overhead costs, including lower costs of complying with applicable government regulations and their willingness to provide services for a lower profit margin. Furthermore, in the Apps and IoT space we compete with IBM, Microsoft, Google, Kongsberg Gruppen and other smaller pure-play companies, as well as large, established oilfield technology providers like Schlumberger and Haliburton. Additionally, in the SI space, we compete primarily with Speedcast and ABB Ltd and other construction contractors. Strong competition and significant investments by competitors to develop new and better solutions may make it difficult for us to maintain our customer base, force us to reduce our prices or increase our costs to develop new solutions.\nFurthermore, competition may emerge from companies that we have not previously perceived as competitors or consolidation of our industry may cause existing competitors to become bigger and stronger with more resources, market awareness and market share. For example, we have experienced customer projects where we have bid directly against some of our satellite bandwidth providers, either acting alone or in conjunction with one of our direct competitors. Competition with our satellite bandwidth providers, either alone or in restrictive arrangements with our suppliers or competitors may materially and adversely affect the availability and pricing of our products and services.\nAs we expand into new markets, we may experience increased competition from some of our competitors that have prior experience or other business in these markets or geographic regions. In addition, some of our customers may decide to insource some of the MCS solutions that we provide, in particular our terrestrial communication services (e.g., Line-of-Site (LOS) or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)), which do not require the same level of maintenance and support as our other services. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competitive forces, to adapt to technological advances, to develop more advanced services and solutions more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors, to continue to develop and deepen our global sales and business development network, and to educate potential customers about the benefits of using our solutions rather than our competitors\u2019 services or in-sourced solutions. Our failure to successfully respond to these competitive challenges could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations are subject to additional or different risks than our United States operations, which may harm our business and financial results.\nWe operate in many countries around the world, including countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Europe and intend to continue to expand the number of countries in which we operate. However, because operations in some countries may be temporary, the total number of countries in which we operate fluctuates. There are many risks inherent in conducting business internationally that are in addition to or different than those affecting our United States operations, including:\n\u2022\nforeign laws and regulations that may be vague or arbitrary, lack traditional concepts of due process, and be subject to unexpected changes or interpretations, resulting in difficulty enforcing contracts or timely collection of receivables;\n\u2022\ntariffs, import and export restrictions and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically dispersed operations and culturally diverse work forces in countries with varying employment laws and practices including restrictions on terminating employees;\n\u2022\nincreased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuation and currency controls;\n\u2022\npotential political and economic instability, which may include military conflict, nationalization or expropriation;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expense of maintaining international sales distribution channels; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining and protecting our intellectual property.\nThe authorities in the countries where we operate may introduce additional regulations for the oil and gas and communications industries. New rules and regulations may be enacted, or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to provide our services. Recently, some of our foreign telecommunications regulators have adopted new interpretations of existing regulations when we have renewed our licenses, causing increased costs in certain jurisdictions. Future amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities in the oil and gas industry and telecommunications industry could harm our operations and financial results. Compliance with and changes in tax laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect our operating results.\nCompliance related tax issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries. Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities, disagreements with taxing authorities over our tax positions and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct, or if we conduct, business in the affected countries.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure or inability to sufficiently protect them could harm our business and our operating results.\nWe own, and maintain certain intellectual property assets, including patents, patent applications, copyrights and trademarks, trade secrets, and rights to certain domain names, which we believe are collectively among our most valuable assets. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through the laws of the U.S. and other countries of the world, and through contractual provisions. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property assets and proprietary rights might not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of those rights. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced.\nInternal restructuring activities may negatively impact the Company.\nReductions in resources may adversely affect or delay various sales, marketing, product development and operational activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Additionally, restructuring activities could have negative effects on our internal control over financial reporting and employee morale.\nInformation technology infrastructure and systems are critical to supporting our operations, accounting and internal controls; any potential failure of our information technology infrastructure or systems could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe continue to update and enhance our information systems. If a problem occurs that impairs or compromises this infrastructure, systems upgrades and/or new systems implementations; the resulting disruption could impede our ability to perform accounting, invoice, process orders, generate management reports or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue and could require us to incur significant expenses to remediate. Additionally, any such events could adversely harm our legal, accounting and compliance capabilities including but not limited to: our ability to (i) timely file reports with the SEC; (ii) maintain effectiveness of internal control; (iii) timely file financial statements required by certain statutes; (iv) timely file compliance reports with our lenders under our credit agreement; and (v) timely file income taxes with the IRS, foreign taxing authorities, and local taxing authorities.\nSevere weather in the Gulf of Mexico or other areas where we operate could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain areas in and near the Gulf of Mexico and other areas in which our clients operate experience unfavorable weather conditions, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions, on a relatively frequent basis. A major storm or threat of a major storm in these areas may harm our business. Our clients\u2019 drilling rigs, production platforms and other vessels in these areas are susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms, which may cause them to no longer need our communication services. Our equipment on these rigs, platforms or vessels could be damaged causing us to have service interruptions and lose business or incur significant costs for the replacement of such equipment. Even the threat of a very large storm will sometimes cause our clients to limit activities in an area and thus harm our business. Changing weather conditions could impair satellite connectivity, cause more sites to be shut down and generally cause activities to be limited so that our business may be harmed. This risk is more pronounced for LOS microwave service, as there is a likely loss of service for multiple subsequent microwave sites in the network relay.\nChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.\nOur U.S. services are provided on a private carrier basis. As such, these services are subject to light or no regulation by the FCC and state PUCs. If the FCC or one or more PUCs or any other telecommunications regulator determine that these services or the services of our subsidiaries or affiliates constitute common carrier offerings or change the regulations applicable to private carriers, we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of those laws and regulations. We may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties if we fail to comply with those requirements.\nOur international operations are also regulated by various non-U.S. governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards and requirements. The adoption of new laws or regulations, changes to the existing regulatory framework, new interpretations of the laws that apply to our operations, or the loss of, or a material limitation on, any of our material licenses could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Recently, some of our foreign telecommunications regulators have adopted new interpretations of existing regulations when we have renewed our licenses, causing increased costs in certain jurisdictions.\nThe FCC is considering reallocating 6 GHZ technology to allow unlicensed use of this spectrum. Much of our Gulf of Mexico backbone network traffic is carried over 6 GHZ spectrum which we own. Unlicensed use of this spectrum could interfere with our client\u2019s safety critical communications and degrade our overall network performance. Any such interference or degradation of performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we infringe, or if third parties assert that we infringe, third-party intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs and incur significant harm to our business.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us, which could result in substantial damages if it is ultimately determined that our services infringe a third-party\u2019s proprietary rights. Even if claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from our other business concerns.\nMany of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries that may make them difficult or expensive to interpret or enforce.\nMany of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries other than the U.S., which may create both legal and practical difficulties in case of a dispute or conflict. We operate in regions where the ability to protect contractual and other legal rights may be limited. In addition, having to pursue arbitration or litigation in some countries may be more difficult or expensive than pursuing litigation in the United States.\nSome of our stockholders could exert control over the Company.\nAs of February 28, 2021, funds associated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 23.8% of our outstanding voting power and have a seat on our board of directors. Additionally, as of February 28, 2021, funds associated with FMR, LLC, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 5.1% of our outstanding voting power, and funds associated with Arrowmark Colorado Holding, LLC, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 6.3% of our outstanding voting power. As a result, any of these stockholders could potentially exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election or removal of our directors and change of control transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and limitations on the expatriation or conversion of currencies, which may result in significant financial charges, increased costs of operations or decreased demand for our services and solutions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, 11.8% of our revenues were earned in non-U.S. currencies, while a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures and all of our outstanding debt, was priced in U.S. dollars. In addition, we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material effect on our reported earnings or the value of our assets. In the future, a greater portion of our revenues may be earned in non-U.S. currencies, increasing this risk of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nAny depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which we conduct business may result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may, at the same time, decrease demand for our services and solutions in the affected markets. If our operating companies distribute dividends in local currencies in the future, the amount of cash we receive will also be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, some of the countries in which we have operations do or may restrict the expatriation or conversion of currency making such cash unavailable for financing of our global operations and capital investments.\nFurthermore, a majority of our cash balances are held outside of the United States. Repatriating cash to the United States can require paying taxes in one or more countries making the cash available to us less than that reported in our financial statements.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and, as such, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, (i.e. a company with less than $250 million of public float) and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our smaller reporting company status. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our PPP Loan, and our application for the PPP Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible or could result in damage to our reputation.\nIn May 2020, we borrowed $6.3 under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, a portion of which may be forgiven. All or a portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven by the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) upon our application in accordance with the forgiveness rules set out in the CARES Act. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered lease payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the twenty-four-week period beginning on the date the loan is advanced, but not to exceed December 31, 2020. Not more than 40% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs. In addition, the amount of the PPP Loan eligible for forgiveness related to payroll costs is subject to additional\nlimitations as outlined in the CARES Act. Although we intend to use the entire PPP Loan for designated qualifying expenses and to apply for forgiveness in accordance with the terms of the Paycheck Protection Program, no assurance can be given that we will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan in whole or in part. Furthermore, on April 28, 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury stated that the SBA will perform a full review of any PPP loan over $2.0 million before forgiving the loan.\nWe will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, through monthly principal and interest payments. These payments will commence following the end of the deferment period as defined in the PPP Loan. The PPP bears interest at a rate of 1% per annum. We may prepay the principal at any time without penalty.\nAs part of our application for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation and access to alternative forms of capital, and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act. The certification described above does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. On April 23, 2020, the SBA issued guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program has resulted in significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good faith belief that given our Company\u2019s circumstances we satisfied all eligible requirements for the PPP Loan, we are later determined to have violated any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan, such as the False Claims Act, or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties and could be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety. In addition, receipt of a PPP Loan may result in adverse publicity and damage to reputation, and a review or audit by the SBA or other government entity or claims under the False Claims Act could consume significant financial and management resources. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 12494, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "RNET"}
