{"cik": "1365555", "company": "Amtrust Financial Services, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Included below are the primary risks and uncertainties that, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or our access to liquidity. The following discussion of risk factors includes forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. See \u201cNote on Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is sensitive to general economic, business, and industry conditions.\nWe are exposed to general economic, business and industry conditions, both in the United States and internationally. Adverse global economic and financial conditions are difficult to predict and mitigate against, and therefore the potential impact is difficult to estimate. Adverse general economic conditions may cause, among other things, significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other credit providers, substantial volatility in equity and currency values worldwide, and/or a prolonged recessionary or slow growth period. Several of the risks we face, including those related to our investment portfolio, reinsurance arrangements, our estimates of loss reserves, emerging claim and coverage issues, the competitive environment and regulatory developments result from, or are made worse by, an economic slowdown or financial disruption.\nOur loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses.\nThe principal cost associated with our property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, significant time may pass before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and concluded. We will not know whether reserves established or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Our loss reserves are based on estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims and on actuarial estimation techniques. These estimates are based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency of claims and changes in the average cost of claims that may arise in the future. They are inherently uncertain and do not represent an exact measure of actual liability. Judgment is required to determine the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under current facts and circumstances. The interpretation of this historical data can be impacted by external forces, principally legislative changes, economic fluctuations and legal trends.\nOur estimated unpaid losses are material ($7.2 billion at December 31, 2015), so even small percentage increases to the aggregate liability estimate can result in materially lower future periodic reported earnings. An increase in reserves could result in a reduction in our surplus, which could result in a downgrade in our A.M. Best rating. Such a downgrade could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to sell insurance policies.\nIn particular, workers\u2019 compensation claims are often paid over a long period of time and there are no policy limits on our liability for workers\u2019 compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance. Therefore, estimating reserves for workers\u2019 compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other types of insurance claims with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts.\nCatastrophic losses, including those that may result from the possible negative effects of climate change, or the frequency of smaller insured losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nProperty and casualty insurers are subject to claims arising from catastrophes. Catastrophes can cause losses in multiple property and casualty lines, including property and workers\u2019 compensation. Workers\u2019 compensation constitutes approximately 41% of our business and we write commercial property insurance in our Specialty Program segment and our Small Commercial Business segment. In addition, we issue policies that cover crop-related revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes and other perils such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, frost, insects, and disease. The incidence and severity of catastrophes, such as those due to natural disasters and also large-scale terrorist attacks, are inherently unpredictable, and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial.\nLonger-term weather trends are changing and new types of catastrophic losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that is expected to result in an increased incidence of extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, including\neffects on global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperature, sea levels, rain and snow. Climate change could increase the frequency and severity of catastrophic losses we experience in both coastal and non-coastal areas.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may experience an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period, which could cause substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to write new business. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to these types of catastrophic and cumulative losses, including through the use of reinsurance, the severity or frequency of these types of losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance coverage.\nIf we do not accurately price our policies, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn general, the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time the policy is issued and, therefore, before all of our underlying costs are known. Like other insurance companies, we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates. Establishing adequate premiums is necessary, together with investment income, to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses and other underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. If we do not accurately assess the risks that we assume, we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses, which could reduce our net income and cause us to become unprofitable. In order to accurately price our policies, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our insureds; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both frequency and severity of our insureds\u2019 losses with reasonable accuracy.\nOur ability to undertake these efforts successfully and, as a result, accurately price our policies, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022\navailability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data;\n\u2022\nuncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nour failure to implement appropriate rating formulas or other pricing methodologies;\n\u2022\nregulatory constraints on rate increases;\n\u2022\nincreases or changes in taxes;\n\u2022\nunexpected escalation in the costs of ongoing medical treatment;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action.\nOur premium rates, generally, are established for the term of the policy. Consequently, we could set our premiums too low, which would negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability, or we could set our premiums too high, which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues.\nA downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of our principal insurance subsidiaries would likely reduce the amount of business we are able to write and could adversely impact the competitive positions of our insurance subsidiaries.\nA.M. Best evaluates insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims. Our principal insurance subsidiaries are rated \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) by A.M. Best. The ratings of A.M. Best are subject to periodic review using, among other things, proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by our A.M. Best rating. If our A.M. Best rating is reduced, our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher ratings.\nIf market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.\nAs part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase quota share reinsurance and excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance. The Maiden Quota Share and our reinsurance agreement with Maiden Reinsurance for our European medical liability business reinsure approximately 40% of our net retained premiums. In addition, we purchase reinsurance on an excess of loss and catastrophe basis for protection against catastrophic events and other large losses. Market conditions beyond our control, in terms of price and available capacity, may affect the level of our business and profitability. The Maiden Quota Share\nwas renewed through June 30, 2019 and our excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal.\nWe may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities, including the Maiden Quota Share and our reinsurance agreement with Maiden Reinsurance for our European medical liability business, or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. Increases in the cost of reinsurance would adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance on favorable terms, either our net exposure to risk would increase, which would increase our costs, or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures, we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite, which would reduce our revenues.\nRetentions in various lines of business expose us to potential losses.\nWe retain risk for our own account on business underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries. The determination to reduce the amount of reinsurance we purchase or not to purchase reinsurance for a particular risk or line of business is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions, pricing, availability of reinsurance, the level of our capital and our loss history. Such determinations have the effect of increasing our financial exposure to losses associated with such risks or in such lines of business and, in the event of significant losses associated with such risks or lines of business, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to recover amounts due from our third-party reinsurers, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\nReinsurance does not discharge our obligations under the insurance policies we write; it merely provides us with a contractual right to seek reimbursement on certain claims. We remain liable to our policyholders even if we are unable to make recoveries that we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts. As a result, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Losses are recovered from our reinsurers after underlying policy claims are paid. The creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we recover amounts to which we are entitled. Therefore, if a reinsurer were unable to meet its obligations to us, we would be responsible for claims and claim settlement expenses for which we would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer. If we were unable to collect these amounts from our reinsurers, our costs would increase and our financial condition would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate amount of approximately $3.0 billion of recoverables from third-party reinsurers on paid and unpaid losses.\nOur relationships with Maiden Holdings, Ltd., NGHC and ACP Re, Ltd. and their subsidiaries may present, and make us vulnerable to, difficult conflicts of interest, business opportunity issues and legal challenges.\nConflicts of interest could arise with respect to business opportunities that could be advantageous to Maiden, NGHC, ACP Re or their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and us or our subsidiaries, on the other hand. In addition, potential conflicts of interest may arise should our interests and those of Maiden, NGHC or ACP Re diverge. For a complete description of our relationships with Maiden, NGHC and ACP Re, see the discussion found in Note 14. \u201cRelated Party Transactions.\u201d\nIn addition, three members of our Board of Directors, Donald T. DeCarlo, who is an independent member of our Board of Directors, and Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Michael Karfunkel, are also members of NGHC\u2019s board of directors. Mr. Zyskind\u2019s service as our President and Chief Executive Officer, as non-executive chairman of the board of Maiden, and as a member of NGHC\u2019s board, and Mr. DeCarlo\u2019s and Mr. Michael Karfunkel's services as a member of our Board and NGHC\u2019s board could raise a potential challenge under anti-trust laws. Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act prohibits a person from serving as a director or officer in any two competing corporations under certain circumstances. If we and Maiden or NGHC were in the future deemed to be competitors within the meaning of the Clayton Antitrust Act and certain thresholds relating to direct competition between us and Maiden or NGHC are met, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission could challenge the arrangement.\nWe receive significant ceding commission from Maiden.\nWe receive significant ceding commission from Maiden through the Maiden Quota Share and our reinsurance agreement with Maiden Reinsurance for our European medical liability business. A detailed description of these reinsurance arrangements is found in \u201cReinsurance\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe may be unable to maintain these reinsurance arrangements beyond their current terms, and we may not be able to readily replace these arrangements if they terminate. If we were unable to continue or replace these arrangements on equally favorable terms, our underwriting capacity and commission and fee income could decline, we could experience a downgrade in our A.M. Best rating, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe receive significant service and fee income from NGHC, Maiden and ACP Re.\nWe receive significant service and fee income from NGHC, Maiden and ACP Re through a series of agreements described in Note 14. \"Related Party Transactions.\" We may be unable to maintain these arrangements. If we no longer provide these services to Maiden, NGHC and ACP Re and do not replace them with services provided to other parties on equally favorable terms and at similar levels, our service and fee income could decline, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully acquire or integrate additional business or manage the growth of our operations, which could make it difficult for us to compete and could negatively affect our profitability.\nFrom time to time we may pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives. The process of integrating an acquired business or company can be complex and costly, may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and will require substantial management attention. We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire additional existing business on acceptable terms or integrate any business that we acquire.\nIn addition, our growth strategy of expanding in our existing markets, opportunistically acquiring books of business, other insurance companies or producers, entering new geographic markets and further developing our relationships with independent agencies and extended warranty/service contract administrators subjects us to various risks, including risks associated with our ability to identify profitable new geographic markets for entry, attract and retain qualified personnel for expanded operations, identify, recruit and integrate new independent agencies and extended warranty/service contract administrators, integrate information technology systems, manage risks associated with the acquisition of entities in foreign markets with which we are less familiar, expand existing agency relationships and augment our internal monitoring and control systems as we expand our business.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any new business may not be profitable. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business, and our success and profitability rely, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement technology improvements.\nWe depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, and thus our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner. Some system development projects are long-term in nature, may negatively impact our expense ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we expect to complete. In addition, system development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in accelerated recognition of expenses. If we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology platform, or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.\nIf we experience security breaches or other disruptions involving our technology, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely affected, we could be liable to third parties and our reputation could suffer.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to access our information technology and telecommunication systems. We rely upon our systems, as well as the systems of our vendors, to perform business functions, such as underwriting and administering policies, processing claim payments, providing customer support, and complying with insurance regulatory requirements. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to process our business timely and efficiently and protect our information systems from physical loss or unauthorized access. In the event one or more of our facilities cannot be accessed due to a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or power outage, or systems and telecommunications failures or outages, external attacks such as computer viruses, malware or cyber-attacks, or other disruptions occur, our ability to perform business operations on a timely basis could be significantly impaired and may cause our systems to be inaccessible for an extended period of time. A sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to perform necessary business operations in a timely manner, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. While we have\nexperienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology and systems, to date none of these threats has had a material impact on our business or operations. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. Our systems and networks may be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers' information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisers or other damage to our business. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents and negative media attention could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we could suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. Advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments could compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.\nOperational risks, including the risk of fraud, are inherent in our business, and we may not be successful in preventing internal control failures or detecting all errors or fraud.\nAs a result of limitations inherent in all control systems, we may not be able to adequately prevent fraud or errors from occurring. Our controls and procedures for prevention and detection of fraud may not prevent errors or instances of human fraud. Judgments in decision making can be faulty and breakdowns may occur through simple human error. In addition, controls can be circumvented by individuals or multiple persons acting in collusion. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in maintaining a cost-effective control system, operational errors or fraud may occur and may not be detected. Any ineffectiveness in our internal controls resulting from fraud or error could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. We test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually. If we determined that such goodwill or intangible assets has or have been impaired, we would be required to write down the goodwill or the intangible asset by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nOur significant level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and impair our ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.0 billion, which does not include approximately $168.0 million aggregate principal amount of a loan made by Maiden Reinsurance to us in connection with a reinsurance agreement between AII and Maiden Reinsurance that requires Maiden Reinsurance to provide sufficient collateral to secure its proportionate share of AII\u2019s obligations.This amount is accounted for as a note payable on our balance sheet. We may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, requiring the dedication of portions of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, restricting our operational flexibility due to restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to explore certain business opportunities, dispose of assets and take other actions and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our annual debt service obligation on our outstanding indebtedness was approximately $54 million. We may be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, our business may not generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or our cash needs may increase. If we were unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we failed to comply with the various requirements of any indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur in the future, we would be in default, which would permit the holders of the affected indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause us to default\nunder our other indebtedness. Any default under any indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us, or only available to us on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including regulatory requirements, the financial stability of our reinsurers, future acquisitions and our ability to write new business and establish premium rates sufficient to cover our estimated claims. We may need to raise additional capital or curtail our growth to support future operating requirements or cover claims. If we have to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available to us or may be available only on terms that are not favorable, such as terms resulting in dilution to our stockholders, or the securities sold may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our currently issued and outstanding common stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may sell our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock, at a price per share less than the market value of our common stock. If we cannot obtain adequate additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe covenants in our credit facilities and indentures governing our convertible senior notes due 2021 and 2044 and 6.125% notes due 2023 limit our financial and operational flexibility, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur credit facilities and indentures governing our convertible senior notes and 6.125% notes due 2023 contain covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to borrow money, make particular types of investments or other restricted payments, sell assets, merge or consolidate. These covenants could restrict our ability to achieve our business objectives, and therefore, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, our credit facilities and the indenture governing our 6.125% notes due 2023 also require us to maintain specific financial ratios. If we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios, the lenders under our credit facilities could cancel their commitments to lend and/or issue letters of credit and the lenders under our credit facilities and our noteholders could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them.\nIf we were unable to realize our investment objectives, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nInvestment income is an important component of our net income. Our investments are subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, market volatility, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits, tax law changes and disputes, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. General economic conditions may be adversely affected by U.S. involvement in hostilities with other countries and large-scale acts of terrorism, or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts.\nWe may be forced to liquidate investments at times and prices that are not optimal, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Investment losses could decrease our asset base and adversely affect our ability to conduct business and pay claims. Any significant decline in our investment income would adversely affect our revenues and net income and, as a result, decrease our surplus and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nA significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations.\nOur investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2015, our investment in fixed income securities was approximately $5.43 billion, or 78% of our total investment portfolio.\nThe fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise. Conversely, if interest rates decline, the fair market value of fixed income securities generally increases. However, investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will decrease due to being reinvested at lower interest rates. In addition, some fixed income securities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations. Based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately $281.3 million.\nThe value of investments in fixed income securities, and particularly our investments in high-yield securities, is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer or increases in market interest rates. Our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we\ninvest, as well as risks inherent in particular securities. These conditions could result in lower than expected yields on our fixed securities and short term investment portfolio. In addition, our investment in less liquid investments, such as our investment in NGHC, life settlement contracts and real estate, is subject to increased valuation uncertainty because the valuation is more subjective, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying cost) does not reflect the price at which an actual transaction would occur.\nAs a result of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, our net investment income could decrease, or we could experience realized and/or unrealized investment losses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur international operations expose us to investment, political, legal and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk.\nOur expanding international operations expose us to increased investment, political, legal and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Investments outside the United States also subject us to additional laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws in other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. If our controls are ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur investments in non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in the currency markets, and those markets can be volatile. We may, from time to time, experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies or be unable to repatriate cash to the United States, or otherwise make available cash in the United States, and to do so at a favorable foreign exchange rate and with favorable tax ramifications, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be subject to taxes on our Luxembourg affiliates\u2019 equalization reserves.\nWe have made several acquisitions of Luxembourg-domiciled reinsurance companies. In connection with these transactions, we acquire cash and the associated equalization reserves of the reinsurance companies. An \u201cequalization reserve\u201d is a catastrophe reserve in excess of required reserves determined by a formula based on the volatility of the business ceded to the reinsurance company and is established pursuant to Luxembourg law. Luxembourg reinsurance companies are required to establish equalization reserves for Luxembourg statutory and tax purposes, but the equalization reserves are not recognized under U.S. GAAP.\nProvided that we are able to cede business that generates a net loss to the reinsurance companies through intercompany reinsurance arrangements sufficient to offset the reinsurers\u2019 required reductions of the equalization reserves, Luxembourg would not, under laws currently in effect, impose any income, corporation or profits tax on the reinsurance companies. However, if the reinsurance companies were to cease reinsuring business without exhausting the equalization reserves, they would be taxed by Luxembourg at a rate of approximately 30%. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $37 million of unutilized equalization reserves and an associated deferred tax liability of approximately $11 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we were able to reduce our overall income tax expense by a net amount of approximately $2 million to reflect the net reduction of the deferred tax liability related to the utilization of the equalization reserves.\nResolution of uncertain tax matters and changes in tax laws or taxing authority interpretations of tax laws could result in actual tax benefits or deductions that are different than we have estimated, both with regard to amounts recognized and the timing of recognition. Such differences could affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nOur provision for income taxes, our recorded tax liabilities and net deferred tax assets, including any valuation allowances, are recorded based on estimates. These estimates require us to make significant judgments regarding a number of factors, including, among others, the applicability of various federal and state laws, our interpretation of tax laws and the interpretations given to those tax laws by taxing authorities and courts, the timing of future income and deductions, and our expected levels and sources of future taxable income. Additionally, from time to time there are changes to tax laws and interpretations of tax laws that could change our estimates of the amount of tax benefits or deductions expected to be available to us in future periods. In either case, changes to our prior estimates would be reflected in the period changed and could have a material effect on our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we do business, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, as part of its \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d initiative, have focused on perceived tax avoidance by multinational corporations. As a result, the tax laws\nin the U.S., United Kingdom, Bermuda, Ireland, Italy, and Luxembourg and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction taxes. We are periodically under routine examination by various federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding tax matters and our tax positions could be successfully challenged and the costs of defending our tax positions could be considerable, both of which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on the efforts of our principal executive officers.\nOur success is dependent on the efforts of our principal executive officers, Barry D. Zyskind, Ronald E. Pipoly, Jr., Michael Saxon, Christopher Longo and Max Caviet, because of their industry expertise, knowledge of our markets and relationships with our independent agencies and warranty administrators. Although we have entered into employment agreements with all of our principal executive officers, should any of these executive officers cease working for us, we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry and/or the specialty risk sectors that we target, and our business may be adversely affected. We do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or other employees.\nWe are an insurance holding company and do not have any direct operations.\nOur operations are substantially conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries As a holding company, we do not own any significant assets other than equity in our subsidiaries. Payments from our insurance subsidiaries pursuant to management agreements and tax sharing agreements, as well as fee income we generate from providing services discussed throughout this report, are our primary source of funds to pay our direct expenses. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us depends on the availability of cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets and other capital-raising activities. Dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to contractual and other restrictions and are subject to other business considerations.\nPayment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by insurance laws of various states, and the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business (primarily Ireland, United Kingdom and Bermuda), including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. As a result, at times, we may not be able to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, which would affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, as discussed below, and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, our insurance subsidiaries collectively could pay dividends to us of $621.6 million without prior regulatory approval. Any dividends paid by our subsidiaries would reduce their surplus. The inability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other permitted payments in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level would have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical in nature, which may affect our overall financial performance.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess capacity (known as a soft market) followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity (known as a hard market). Although an individual insurance company\u2019s financial performance is also dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern. We cannot predict with certainty the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle because the cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors beyond our control. We have experienced increased price competition in certain of our target markets, and these cyclical patterns, the actions of our competitors, and general economic factors could cause our revenues and net income to fluctuate, which may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile.\nNegative developments in the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we engage in other businesses, approximately 41% of our gross written premium currently is attributable to workers\u2019 compensation insurance. As a result, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in certain states in which we do business, insurance regulators set the premium rates we may charge. In addition, if legislators in one of our larger markets were to enact legislation to increase the scope or amount of benefits for employees under workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies without related premium increases or loss control measures, this could negatively affect\nthe workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry. Negative developments in the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry could have a greater effect on us than on more diversified insurance companies that also sell many other types of insurance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and may lack the financial resources to compete effectively.\nWe compete with other insurance companies, both domestic and foreign, and many of our existing and potential competitors are larger, have longer operating histories, and possess greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. In our Small Commercial Business segment, we also compete with individual self-insured companies, state insurance pools and self-insurance funds. We compete on the basis of many factors, including coverage availability, responsiveness to the needs of our independent producers, claims management, payment/settlement terms, premium rates, policy terms, types of insurance offered, overall financial strength, financial ratings and reputation. If any of our competitors offer premium rates, policy terms or types of insurance that are more competitive than ours, we could lose market share. We may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we currently operate or establish a competitive position in new markets into which we may expand.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued. In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could be harmful to our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability, limit our growth or restrict our ability to transact business.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business we can write, the rates we can charge for coverage, the level of capital we must maintain, and restrictions on the types and size of investments we can make. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries, may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.. For a discussion of the various types of regulation we face, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation.\u201d\nWe may have exposure to losses from terrorism for which we are required by law to provide coverage regarding such losses.\nU.S. insurers are required by state and federal law to offer coverage for terrorism in certain commercial lines, including workers\u2019 compensation. As discussed under \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation - United States - Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes,\u201d the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, as extended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, or TRIPRA, requires commercial property and casualty insurance companies to offer coverage for acts of terrorism, whether foreign or domestic, and established a federal assistance program through the end of 2020 to help cover claims related to future terrorism-related losses. The impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable, and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature, extent, location and timing of such an act. Although we reinsure a portion of the terrorism risk we retain under the program, our terrorism reinsurance does not provide full coverage for an act stemming from nuclear, biological or chemical terrorism.\nThe effects of litigation on our business are uncertain.\nAlthough we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers, other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts, and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation is based on a variety of issues, including insurance and claim settlement practices. If we become subject to such litigation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Outstanding Indebtedness\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of developments beyond our control, which may cause volatility in the price of our shares of common stock and the market price of our Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cAFSI.\u201d Our Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols \u201cAFSI-A,\u201d \u201cAFSI-B\u201d, \"AFSI-C\" and \u201cAFSI-D.\u201d Our performance, as well as the risks discussed herein, government or regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates and general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock and the market price of our Preferred Stock. Developments that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock or Preferred Stock include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges to our earnings estimates or publications of research reports about us or the industry;\n\u2022\nrising levels of claims costs, changes in the frequency or severity of claims or new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurance company liability;\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of our third-party reinsurers, changes in the level of reinsurance capacity, termination of reinsurance arrangements and changes in our capital capacity;\n\u2022\nincreases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of common or preferred stock to demand a higher yield;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of other insurance companies;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates or inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment that affect returns on invested assets;\n\u2022\nchanges to our credit worthiness;\n\u2022\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nreaction to the sale or purchase of company stock by our principal stockholders or our executive officers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic environment in the markets in which we operate, including reduction in the business activities of our policyholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax law;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is possible that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility.\nRepurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Stock repurchases may not enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common\nstock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our common stock price and the market price of our Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls , we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports or otherwise maintain appropriate internal controls, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price for our common and preferred stock could decline.\nOur principal stockholders have the ability to control our business, which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders.\nBased on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015, Barry D. Zyskind, Michael Karfunkel, Leah Karfunkel (wife of Michael Karfunkel and sole trustee of the Trust) and George Karfunkel, directly or indirectly, collectively own or control approximately 48% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. These stockholders may have interests that are different from other stockholders.\nOn November 10, 2015, we ceased being a \"controlled company\" as defined in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(e), meaning we are no longer exempt from the board and board committee independence requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As a result, we have one year from the date we ceased being a \"controlled company\" to have an entirely independent compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee. If we are unable to achieve compliance with these requirements, our common stock could be de-listed from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nIn addition, Michael Karfunkel and George Karfunkel, through entities that each of them controls, have entered into transactions with us and may from time to time in the future enter into other transactions with us. As a result, these individuals may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, their interest as our stockholders. Such transactions may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur principal stockholders could delay or prevent an acquisition or merger of our company even if the transaction could benefit other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of share ownership makes it difficult for other stockholders to replace directors and management without the consent of the controlling stockholders. In addition, this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the price prospective buyers are willing to pay for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect the trading price of our convertible senior notes.\nWe may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock or Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock.\nAs discussed above, the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is regulated and under certain circumstances, restricted, pursuant to applicable law. If our insurance subsidiaries could not pay dividends, we may not, in turn, be able to pay dividends to stockholders. In addition, the terms of our junior subordinated debentures and our credit facilities limit, in some circumstances, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock, and future financing arrangements may include prohibitions on dividends or other restrictions. For these reasons, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock or Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock.\nWe have a history of paying dividends to our stockholders. However, future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors including the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, which ability is restricted in the manner discussed above. Also, we may be unable to continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution.\nOur shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are equity interests and are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nOur shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims of our creditors with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including our liquidation, dissolution and winding up. As of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt was $1,010 million and our total consolidated liabilities were approximately $14.0 billion. We may incur additional debt and liabilities in the future. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict payments of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares, dividends are payable only if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors). Our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares may be limited by the terms of our agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness and by the provisions of other existing and future agreements.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are non-cumulative.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are non-cumulative and payable only out of our legally available funds. Consequently, if our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors) does not authorize and declare a dividend for any dividend period with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares, holders of the Series A, B, C and D Preferred Stock and, in turn, the depositary shares, will not be entitled to receive any such dividend, and such unpaid dividend will not accumulate and will never be payable. We have no obligation to pay dividends for a dividend period on or after the dividend payment date for such period if our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors) has not declared such dividend before the related dividend payment date. If dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B, C and D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are authorized and declared with respect to any subsequent dividend period, we will be free to pay dividends on any other series of preferred stock and/or our common shares.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance any required purchases of our convertible senior notes due 2044 upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d which would constitute an event of default under the indentures.\nIf a fundamental change (as such term is defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes due 2044) occurs, holders of these convertible senior notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to purchase for cash any or all of the notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof such that the principal amount that remains outstanding of each note purchased in part equals $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The fundamental change purchase price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. However, we may not have sufficient funds at the time we are required to purchase the convertible senior notes surrendered therefor and we may not be able to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have not established a sinking fund for payment of the convertible senior notes due 2044, nor do we anticipate doing so. In addition, our ability to purchase these convertible senior notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or we may in the future enter into credit agreements or other agreements that may contain provisions prohibiting redemption or repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances, or may provide that a designated event constitutes an event of default under that agreement. If a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing these convertible senior notes, we could seek a waiver from the holders of these notes or attempt to refinance these notes. If we were not able to obtain consent, we would not be permitted to purchase the convertible senior notes. Our failure to purchase tendered convertible senior notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the notes, which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness.\nThe conditional conversion features of the convertible senior notes due 2044, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf one of the conversion contingencies in our convertible senior notes due 2044 is triggered, holders of these convertible senior notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible senior notes, we may be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity and various aspects of our business.\nCertain provisions in our convertible senior notes due 2021 and 2044 could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in our convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change within the meaning of our outstanding convertible senior notes, holders of our convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash. In addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a make-whole fundamental change within the meaning of our outstanding convertible senior notes, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. In any of these cases, and in other cases, our obligations under the convertible senior notes as well as provisions of our organizational documents and other agreements could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nOur subordinated notes are subordinated in right of payment to our senior indebtedness and holders of these subordinated notes may recover ratably less than unsubordinated creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. In addition, our subordinated notes are structurally subordinate to the debt of our subsidiaries.\nOur subordinated notes rank junior in right of payment to the claims of holders of our senior indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to us or our property, our creditors, other than those in respect of debt ranking equal with or junior to the subordinated notes, will be entitled to receive payment in full of all obligations due to them before the holders of the subordinated notes will be entitled to receive any payment. As a result, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, holders of the subordinated notes may recover ratably less than unsubordinated creditors. In addition, the indentures governing the subordinated notes prevent us from making payments in respect of the subordinated notes if any principal, premium or interest in respect of our senior indebtedness is not paid within any applicable grace period (including at maturity) or any other default on our senior indebtedness occurs and the maturity of such senior indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors, including the holders of our subordinated notes, to participate in the distribution or allocation of the assets of any subsidiary during its liquidation or reorganization, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary\u2019s creditors, unless we are ourselves a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. Claims from creditors (other than us) against the subsidiaries may include long-term and medium-term debt and substantial obligations related to federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings. Our subordinated notes are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, our subsidiaries, and our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the subordinated notes.", "PERMNO": 91603, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "AFSI"}
