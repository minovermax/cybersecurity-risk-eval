RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are described below. The following list is not all-inclusive, and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may have a material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nRisks Related Primarily to Operating our Business\nOur financial and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and annual fluctuations. Some of the quarterly variation is the result of weather, particularly rain and snow, which create difficult operating conditions. Similarly, demand for routine repair and maintenance services for gas utilities is lower during their peak customer needs in the winter. Some of the annual variation is the result of large construction projects which fluctuate based on general economic conditions and customer needs. Annual and quarterly results may also be adversely affected by:\n\u00b7 Changes in our mix of customers, projects, contracts and business;\n\u00b7 Regional and/or general economic conditions;\n\u00b7 Variations and changes in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;\n\u00b7 Increases in the costs to perform services caused by changing weather conditions;\n\u00b7 The termination of existing agreements or contracts;\n\u00b7 The budgetary spending patterns of customers;\n\u00b7 Increases in construction costs that we may be unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u00b7 Cost or schedule overruns on fixed-price contracts;\n\u00b7 Availability of qualified labor for specific projects;\n\u00b7 Changes in bonding requirements and bonding availability for existing and new agreements;\n\u00b7 Costs we incur to support growth whether organic or through acquisitions;\n\u00b7 The timing and volume of work under contract; and\n\u00b7 Losses experienced in our operations.\nAs a result, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the operating results expected for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nDemand for our services may decrease during economic recessions or volatile economic cycles, and the reduction in demand in end markets may adversely affect our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenues and profits is generated from construction projects the awarding of which we do not directly control. The engineering and construction industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recessions, downturns in business cycles of our customers, material shortages, price increases by subcontractors, interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control. When the general level of economic activity deteriorates, our customers may delay or cancel upgrades, expansions, and/or maintenance and repairs to their systems. Many factors, including the financial condition of the industry, could adversely affect our customers and their willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future.\nTraditionally, the construction industry has lagged recoveries in the general economy. While economic conditions have improved in general, economic, regulatory and market conditions affecting some of our specific end markets may adversely impact the demand for our services, resulting in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and these conditions may continue to adversely affect us in the future.\nMuch of the work that we perform in the highway markets involves funding by federal, state and local governments. In the current budgetary and political environment, funding for these projects could be reduced significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe are also dependent on the amount of work our customers outsource. In a slower economy, our customers may decide to outsource less infrastructure services reducing demand for our services. In addition, consolidation, competition or capital constraints in the industries we serve may result in reduced spending by our customers.\nIndustry trends and government regulations could reduce demand for our pipeline construction services.\nThe demand for our pipeline construction services is dependent on the level of capital project spending by companies in the oil and gas industry. This level of spending is subject to large fluctuations depending primarily on the current and expectations of future prices of oil and natural gas. The price is a function of many factors, including levels of supply and demand, government policies and regulations, oil industry refining capacity and the potential development of alternative fuels. Since the middle of 2014, there has been a significant decrease in oil prices caused partially by a significant increase in the supply of natural gas due to the development of North American shale formations. If the lower price results in a decrease in activity in the discovery or development of oil and gas reserves, customers could reduce their capital spending on underground projects which could result in a reduction of demand for our services which could adversely affect our overall financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nSpecific government decisions could affect demand for our construction services. For example, a limitation on the use of \u201cfracking\u201d technology, or creation of significant regulatory issues for the construction of underground pipelines, could significantly affect the revenues and profitability of our operations.\nMany of our customers are regulated by federal and state government agencies and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact demand for our services and the profitability of those services.\nMany of our energy customers are regulated by FERC, and our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions. These agencies could change the way in which they interpret current regulations and may impose additional regulations. These changes could have an adverse effect on our customers and the profitability of the services they provide which could reduce demand for our services, adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur business may be materially adversely impacted by regional, national and/or global requirements to significantly limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future.\nGreenhouse gases that result from human activities, including burning of fossil fuels, are the focus of increased scientific and political scrutiny and may be subjected to various legal requirements. International agreements, federal laws, state laws and various regulatory schemes limit or otherwise regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, and additional restrictions are under consideration by different governmental entities. We derive a significant amount of revenues and contract profits from engineering and construction services to clients that own and/or operate a wide range of process plants and own and/or operate electric power generating plants that generate electricity from burning natural gas or various types of solid fuels. These plants may emit greenhouse gases as part of the process to generate electricity or other products. Compliance with the existing greenhouse gas regulation may prove costly or difficult. It is possible that owners and operators of existing or future process plants and electric generating plants could be subject to new or changed environmental regulations that result in significantly limiting or reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the cost of emitting such gases or requiring emissions allowances. The costs of controlling such emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances could be significant. It also is possible that necessary controls or allowances may not be available. Such regulations could negatively impact client investments in capital projects in our markets, which could negatively impact the market for our products and/or services. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the establishment of rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions could impact our ability to perform construction services or to perform these services with current levels of profitability. New regulations may require us to acquire different equipment or change processes. The new equipment may not be available or may not be purchased or rented in a cost effective manner. Project deferrals, delays or cancellations resulting from the potential regulations could adversely impact our business.\nChanges to renewable portfolio standards and decreased demand for renewable energy projects could negatively impact our future results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nA significant portion of our future business may be focused on providing construction and/or installation services to owners and operators of solar power and other renewable energy facilities. Currently, the development of solar and other renewable energy facilities is highly dependent on tax credits, the existence of renewable portfolio standards and other state incentives. Renewable portfolio standards are state-specific statutory provisions requiring that electric utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources. These standards have initiated significant growth in the renewable energy industry and a potential demand for renewable energy infrastructure construction services. Since renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce, elimination of, or changes to, existing renewable portfolio standards, tax credits or similar environmental policies may negatively affect future demand for our services.\nWe may lose business to competitors through the competitive bidding processes, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are engaged in highly competitive businesses in which most customer contracts are awarded through bidding processes based on price and the acceptance of certain risks. We compete with other general and specialty contractors, both foreign and domestic, including large international contractors and small local contractors. The strong competition in our markets requires maintaining skilled personnel and investing in technology, and it also puts pressure on profit margins. We do not obtain contracts from all of our bids and our inability to win bids at acceptable profit margins would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth, which may affect our ability to expand our operations or grow our business, which may cause an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to generate internal growth may be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u00b7 Attract new customers;\n\u00b7 Increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;\n\u00b7 Hire and retain qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 Successfully bid for new projects; and\n\u00b7 Adapt the range of services we offer to address our customers\u2019 evolving construction needs.\nIn addition, our customers may reduce the number or size of projects available to us due to their inability to obtain capital. Our customers may also reduce projects in response to economic conditions.\nMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe timing of new contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in our cash flow and profitability, which could adversely affect our business.\nSubstantial portions of our revenues are derived from project-based work that is awarded through a competitive bid process. The portion of revenue generated from the competitive bid process for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately 64%, 66%, and 69%, respectively. It is generally very difficult to predict the timing and geographic distribution of the projects that we will be awarded. The selection of, timing of or failure to obtain projects, delays in award of projects, the re-bidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-utilization of our assets and reduce our cash flows. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect whether, or when, work will begin. For example, some of our contracts are subject to financing, permitting and other contingencies that may delay or result in termination of projects. We may have difficulty in matching workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of a ready workforce and equipment that is larger than necessary, resulting in unpredictability in our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If any expected contract award or the related work release is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenues. Moreover, construction projects for which our services are contracted may require significant expenditures by us prior to receipt of relevant payments by a customer and may expose us to potential credit risk if the customer encounters financial difficulties. Finally, the winding down or completion of work on significant projects that were active in previous periods will reduce our revenue and earning if the significant projects have not been replaced in the current period.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could have significant effects on our revenues, resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customer base is highly concentrated, with our top ten customers accounting for approximately 53% of our revenue in 2014, 50% of our revenue in 2013 and 56% of our revenue in 2012. However, the customers included in our top ten customer list generally varies from year to year. Our revenue is dependent both on performance of larger construction projects and relatively smaller MSA contracts. For the large construction projects, the completion of the project does not represent the loss of a customer.\nWe also generate ongoing revenues from our MSA customers, generally regulated gas utilities. If we were to lose one of these customers, our revenue could significantly decline. Reduced demand for our services by larger construction customers or a loss of a significant MSA customer could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations expose us to legal, political and economic risks in different countries as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations that could harm our business and financial results. We could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with laws applicable to our foreign activities, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nDuring 2014, 2013 and 2012, revenue attributable to our services outside of the United States was 1.0%, 0.8% and 0.7% of our total revenue, respectively. While much of this revenue is derived from the operations of our Canadian subsidiary, OnQuest Canada, ULC, actual construction operations have occurred in the several far eastern countries and in Australia. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u00b7 Imposition of governmental controls and changes in laws, regulations, policies, practices, tariffs and taxes;\n\u00b7 Political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 Changes in United States and other national government trade policies affecting the market for our services;\n\u00b7 Potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar non-United States laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 Currency exchange rate fluctuations, devaluations and other conversion restrictions;\n\u00b7 Restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States; and\n\u00b7 Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. We require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws. There is no assurance that our policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged FCPA violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\nIn spite of the minimal revenue amounts, any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBacklog may not be realized or may not result in revenues or profits.\nBacklog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to \u201cbacklog\u201d as our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts on which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts plus an estimated level of MSA revenues for the next four quarters. Backlog is not a comprehensive indicator of future revenues. Most contracts may be terminated by our customers on short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer, or for other reasons, could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time. While backlog includes estimated MSA revenues, customers are not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services under the MSA.\nGiven these factors, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our backlog could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBacklog is an indicator of future revenues; however, recognition of revenues from backlog does not necessarily insure that the projects will be profitable. Poor project or contract performance could reduce profits from contracts included in backlog.\nOur actual cost may be greater than expected in performing our fixed-price and unit-price contracts, causing us to realize significantly lower profits or losses on our projects, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a portion of our revenue and profits under fixed-price and unit-price contracts. The approximate portion of revenue generated from fixed-price contracts for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 23%, 48% and 51%, respectively. The approximate portion of revenue generated from unit-price contracts for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 32%, 39% and 30%, respectively. In general, we must estimate the costs of completing a specific project to bid these types of contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials may vary from the costs we originally estimated, and we may not be successful in recouping additional costs from our customers. These variations, may cause gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated. Reduced profitability or losses on projects could occur due to changes in a variety of factors such as:\n\u00b7 Failure to properly estimate costs of engineering, materials, equipment or labor;\n\u00b7 Unanticipated technical problems with the structures, materials or services being supplied by us, which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem;\n\u00b7 Project modifications not reimbursed by the client creating unanticipated costs;\n\u00b7 Changes in the costs of equipment, materials, labor or subcontractors;\n\u00b7 Our suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform;\n\u00b7 Changes in local laws and regulations, and;\n\u00b7 Delays caused by local weather conditions.\nAs projects grow in size and complexity, these factors may combine, and depending on the size of the particular project, variations from the estimated contract costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe require subcontractors and suppliers to assist us in providing certain services, and we may be unable to retain the necessary subcontractors or obtain supplies to complete certain projects adversely affecting our business.\nWe use subcontractors to perform portions of our contracts and to manage workflow, particularly for design, engineering, procurement and some foundation work. We are not dependent on any single subcontractor. However, general market conditions may limit the availability of subcontractors to perform portions of our contracts causing delays and increases in our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also use suppliers to provide the materials and some equipment used for projects. If a supplier fails to provide supplies and equipment at a price we estimated or fails to provide supplies and equipment that is not of acceptable quantity, we may be required to source the supplies or equipment at a higher price or may be required to delay performance of the project. The additional cost or project delays could negatively impact project profitability.\nFailure of a subcontractor or supplier to comply with laws, rules or regulations could negatively affect our business.\nWe may enter into joint ventures which require satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their obligations. The failure of our joint venture partners to perform their joint venture obligations could impose additional financial and performance obligations on us that could result in reduced profits or losses for us with respect to the joint venture.\nAs is typical in our industry, we may enter into various joint ventures and teaming arrangements where control may be shared with unaffiliated third parties. At times, we also participate in joint ventures where we are not a controlling party. In such instances, we may have limited control over joint venture decisions and actions, including internal controls and financial reporting which may have an impact on our business. If our joint venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their joint venture obligations, the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments or provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits for us with respect to the joint venture.\nWe may experience delays and defaults in client payments and we may pay our suppliers and subcontractors before receiving payment from our customers for the related services; we could experience an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use subcontractors and material suppliers for portions of certain work, and our customers pay us for those related services. If we pay our suppliers and subcontractors for materials purchased and work performed for customers who fail to pay, or such customers delay in paying us for the related work or materials, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to recover on claims against project owners or subcontractors for payment or performance could negatively affect our financial results and liquidity.\nWe occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients and subcontractors for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. If we do not properly document the nature of our claims and change orders, or are otherwise not successful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profitability or a loss on a project. Claims often occur from owner-caused delays or changes in scope from the original project. Claims may be subject to lengthy and costly arbitration or litigation and may require a lengthy process. The timing of a settlement and the ability to reach an acceptable settlement may adversely impact our financial results and cash flow.\nFor some projects we may guarantee a timely completion or provide a performance guarantee which could result in additional costs to cover our obligations.\nIn many of our fixed-price contracts we provide a project completion date, and in some of our projects we commit that the project will achieve specific performance standards. If we do not complete the project as scheduled, or if the project does not meet the contracted performance standards, we may be held responsible for the impact to the client resulting from the delay or the inability to meet the standards. Generally, the impact to the client is in the form of liquidated damages in the contract. To the extent that we incur these additional costs, the project profitability and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds, and we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds adversely affecting on financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur contracts frequently require that we provide payment and performance bonds to our customers. Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing bonds.\nCurrent or future market conditions, as well as changes in our surety providers\u2019 assessments of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or to substantially reduce, the availability of bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties, finding more business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects and such interruption or reduction could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur bonding requirements may limit our ability to incur indebtedness, which would limit our ability to refinance our existing credit facilities or to execute our business plan, and potentially result in an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon various factors including our capitalization, working capital, tangible net worth and amount of our indebtedness. In order to help ensure that we can obtain required bonds, we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness that may be needed to refinance our existing credit facilities upon maturity and to execute our business plan. Our inability to incur additional indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to win some new contracts if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit.\nFor many of our clients, surety bonds provide an adequate form of security, but for some clients, additional security in the form of a letter of credit may be required. While we have capacity for letters of credit under our credit facility, the amount required by a client may be in excess of our credit limit. Any such amount would be issued at the sole discretion of our lenders. Failure to provide a letter of credit when required by a client may result in our inability to compete for or win a project.\nDuring the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties. Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers\u2019 infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system failure. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention to the business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our reputation, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are self-insured against potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to employer\u2019s liability, general liability, auto and workers compensation claims, those policies are subject to deductibles or self-insured retention amounts of up to $250,000 per occurrence. We are primarily self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible/self-insured retention. In addition, for our employees not part of a collective bargaining agreement, we provide employee health care benefit plans. Our primary health insurance plan is subject to a deductible of $250,000 per individual claim per year.\nOur insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice. If we fail to comply with these requirements, our coverage could be denied.\nLosses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes the accruals are adequate. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates, our results of operations could be adversely affected in a given period.\nOur business is labor intensive. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, our operating costs may increase which could reduce our profitability and liquidity.\nOur business is labor intensive and our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability may be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may not be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. We have from time-to-time experienced, and may in the future experience, shortages of certain types of qualified personnel. For example, periodically there are shortages of engineers, project managers, field supervisors, and other skilled workers capable of working on and supervising the construction of underground, heavy civil and industrial facilities, as well as providing engineering services. The supply of experienced engineers, project managers, field supervisors and other skilled workers may not be sufficient to meet current or expected demand. The beginning of new, large-scale infrastructure projects or increased competition for workers currently available to us, could affect our business, even if we are not awarded such projects. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. If we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and value of our common stock.\nOur unionized workforce may commence work stoppages, which could adversely affect our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 34% of our hourly employees, primarily consisting of field laborers, were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the 82 collective bargaining agreements to which we are a party, forty five expire during 2015 and require renegotiation. Although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons. For instance, in certain geographic areas, our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union company. In addition, if we acquire a union affiliated company, we may increase our future exposure to withdrawal liabilities for any underfunded pension plans.\nThe current Federal administration has expressed strong support for legislation and regulation that would create more flexibility and opportunity for labor unions to organize non-union workers. This legislation or regulation could result in a greater percentage of our workforce being subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nWithdrawal from multiemployer pension plans associated with our unionized workforce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur collective bargaining agreements generally require that we participate with other companies in multiemployer pension plans. To the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (\u201cMEPA\u201d), may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated. In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. For a plan in critical status, additional required contributions and benefit reductions may apply if a plan is determined to be underfunded, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For plans in critical status, we may be required to make additional contributions, generally in the form of surcharges on contributions otherwise required. Participation in those plans with high funding levels could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if we are not able to adequately mitigate these costs.\nThe amount of the withdrawal liability legislated by ERISA and MEPA varies for every pension plan to which we contribute. For each plan, our liability is the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan multiplied by a fraction: the numerator of the fraction is the sum of our contributions to the plan for the past ten years and the denominator is the sum of all contributions made by all employers for the past ten years. For some pension plans to which we contribute, the unfunded vested benefits are in the billions of dollars. If we cannot reduce the liability through exemptions or negotiations, the withdrawal from a plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate and grow our business effectively if we lose the services of any of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified and skilled personnel in the future. This could lead to a decrease in our overall competitiveness, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and value of your common stock.\nWe are dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, and our ability to retain them and hire other qualified employees. The loss of our executive officers or other key personnel could affect our ability to run our business effectively. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and we may not be able to retain our personnel. The loss of any key person requires the remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. In addition, as some of our key persons approach retirement age, we need to provide for smooth transitions. An inability to find a suitable replacement for any departing executive or senior officer on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business.\nIf we fail to integrate acquisitions successfully, we may experience operational challenges and risks which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire companies that expand, complement or diversify our business. Acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including, among others:\n\u00b7 The diversion of management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined company;\n\u00b7 Managing a significantly larger company than before completion of an acquisition;\n\u00b7 The assimilation of new employees and the integration of business cultures;\n\u00b7 Retaining key personnel;\n\u00b7 The integration of information, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems;\n\u00b7 Challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u00b7 Challenges in combining service offerings and sales and marketing activities;\n\u00b7 The assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves;\n\u00b7 The potential impairment of acquired goodwill and intangible assets; and\n\u00b7 The inability to enforce covenants not to compete.\nIf we cannot effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process of any acquisition, our business could suffer and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nOur business growth could outpace the capability of our internal infrastructure and may prohibit us from expanding our operations or execute our business plan, which failures may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our operations as they expand. To the extent that we are unable to buy or build equipment necessary for a project, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis or to find alternative ways to perform the work without the benefit of equipment ideally suited for the job, which could increase the costs of completing the project. We often bid for work knowing that we will have to rent equipment on a short-term basis, and we include our assumptions of market equipment rental rates in our bid. If market rates for rental equipment increase between the time of bid submission and project execution, our margins for the project may be reduced. In addition, our equipment requires continuous maintenance, which we generally provide through our own repair facilities. If we are unable to continue to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain additional third-party repair services at a higher cost or be unable to bid on contracts.\nOur business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments, which may adversely affect our ability to procure materials and labor, which may adversely affect our overall business.\nWe perform our work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, difficult and hard to reach terrain, difficult site conditions and busy urban centers where delivery of materials and availability of labor may be impacted. Performing work under these conditions can slow our progress, potentially causing us to incur contractual liability to our customers. These difficult conditions may also cause us to incur additional, unanticipated costs that we might not be able to pass on to our customers.\nWe may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.\nOur operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future. Serious accidents, including fatalities, may subject us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business.\nWe may incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the U.S. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. The changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and other costs for which we may not be reimbursed by our customers. The employee insurance requirements are expected to impact our expenses beginning in 2015 as our insurance costs could increase by $2 million to $6 million annually. While we anticipate increases in our customer billing rates to reflect the increased expense, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to pass these costs to our customers or that our competition will increase their bids to reflect the increased healthcare costs. For our multi-year highway projects, we may not be able to anticipate further increases in healthcare costs associated with the healthcare reform legislation.\nInterruptions in information technology or breaches in data security could adversely impact our operations, our ability to report financial results and our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on computer, information and communication technology and related systems to operate our business. As we continue to grow our business, we need to add software and hardware and effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure in order to improve the efficiency and protection of our systems and information. Our computer and communications systems, and consequently our operations, could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, loss of power, telecommunications failures, acts of war, acts of terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and actions by hackers and cyber-terrorists. Any of these, or similar, events could cause system disruptions, delays and loss of critical information, delays in processing transactions and delays in the reporting of financial information. While we have implemented network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or data security breach would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on our subsidiaries for cash distributions to fund debt payments, dividend payments and other liabilities.\nWe are a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the stock that we own of our subsidiaries.\nWe depend on dividends, loans and distributions from these subsidiaries to service our indebtedness, pay dividends, fund share repurchases and satisfy other financial obligations. If contractual limitations or legal regulations were to restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash distributions to us, we may not have sufficient funds to cover our financial obligations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.\nOur ability to generate cash is essential for the funding of our operations and the servicing of our debt. If existing cash balances together with the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities are not sufficient to make future investments, make acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend on a number of factors including prevailing capital market conditions; conditions in our industry; and our operating results. These factors may affect our ability to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. If additional funds were not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities or respond to competitive challenges.\nRisks Related Primarily to the Financial Accounting of our Business\nOur financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results and such differences between the estimates and actual results may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn preparing our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, many estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the reported revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often times, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities, revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion accounting and provisions for income taxes. Actual results for estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur use of percentage-of-completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits, which may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, using the cost-to-cost method, where revenues are estimated based on the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs. This method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of total contract revenues, total costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based upon ongoing reviews of contract profitability.\nPenalties are recorded when known or finalized, which generally is during the latter stages of the contract. In addition, we record adjustments to estimated costs of contracts when we believe the change in the estimate is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, especially when comparing the results of several periods.\nOur reported results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as a result of changes in accounting standards.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board finalized revised standards for revenue recognition which become effective for the Company beginning in 2017. The FASB has also announced they expect to finalize standards regarding the accounting for leases. These changes and other future changes could result in changes in the way we report our financial results. For example, if the lease accounting standard changes the accounting for operating leases, we may need to negotiate changes to our credit agreements to meet certain financial covenants. If we were unable to successfully negotiate these changes, we could negatively impact our ability to maintain or obtain future credit for growth opportunities.\nOur reported results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of impairments of goodwill, other intangible assets or investments.\nWhen we acquire a business, we record an asset called \u201cgoodwill\u201d for the excess amount we pay for the business over the net fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire. At December 31, 2014, our balance sheet included a goodwill amount of $119 million and intangible assets of $40 million resulting from acquisitions made since 2008. Fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Under current accounting rules, goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, while intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. Any impairment of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in connection with the various acquisitions, or for any future acquisitions, would negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, we may enter into various types of investment arrangements, such as an equity interest we hold in a business entity. Our equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 income, losses and distributions. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below its carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, factors such as the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain future earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether an impairment should be recognized. Any future impairments, including impairments of goodwill, intangible assets or investments, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in continuing to meet the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting, including the requirements for management to report on internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. At December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was effective using the internal control standards issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (\u201cCOSO\u201d) of the Treadway Commission: Internal control-Integrated Framework (1992). In 2013, an updated set of internal control standards, COSO 2013, was published. We intend to adopt the COSO 2013 framework in assessing our internal control over financial reporting in 2015; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years. Failure to maintain effective internal controls or the identification of significant internal control deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the future could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock, the reduced ability to obtain financing, the loss of customers, penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements in the future.\nStarting in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company\u2019s management, outside counsel and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors spent considerable time and resources reviewing and analyzing various issues relating to the methods used by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to recognize revenue and estimate contingencies for ongoing projects. The internal review is not yet completed and we cannot estimate when such review will be completed. However, as outlined in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made process and procedural changes that we believe enhance our controls over revenue recognition, and these enhanced controls were in place at December 31, 2014. We anticipate continuing enhancement of our controls, especially as we begin to integrate our financial and operations information systems onto a common platform.\nAs our internal review is ongoing, we cannot predict the final outcome of the review. Until our review efforts are completed, the Company\u2019s management, outside counsel and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors will continue to devote considerable time and resources. A government entity or other third party could bring an action and seek interest, injunctions, fines, civil and criminal penalties, or other remedies, or assert other claims or litigation against the Company with respect to any issues that might arise in connection with the review. We also may not be able to effectively improve and expand our financial infrastructure, and internal operating and administrative systems and controls, or do so on a timely basis. Findings from the our review could result in a loss of investor confidence and decrease in the market value of our common stock, the reduced ability to obtain financing and the loss of customers.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock is subject to potential dilution to our stockholders.\nAs part of our acquisition strategy, we have issued shares of common stock and used shares of common stock as a part of contingent earn-out consideration, which have resulted in dilution to our stockholders. Our Articles of Incorporation permit us to issue up to 90 million shares of common stock of which 51.56 million were outstanding at December 31, 2014. While NASDAQ rules require that we obtain stockholder approval to issue more than 20% additional shares, stockholder approval is not required below that level. In addition, we can issue shares of preferred stock which could cause further dilution to the stockholder, resulting in reduced net income and cash flow available to common stockholders.\nIn 2013, our stockholders adopted our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201cEquity Plan\u201d). The Equity Plan replaced a previous plan. The Equity Plan authorized the Board of Directors to issue equity awards totaling 2,526,275 shares of our common stock. Our current director compensation plan, our management long-term incentive plan and any additional equity awards made will have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership.\nOur Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President is a significant stockholder, which may make it possible for him to have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval and his interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014 our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President beneficially owned approximately 23% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. He may have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. Such influence could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting to purchase us or take us over and could reduce the market price offered for our common stock.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change in control.\nAs a Delaware corporation, anti-takeover provisions may impose an impediment to the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be of benefit to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws also may impose an impediment or discourage others from a takeover. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 Our Board of Directors is classified;\n\u00b7 Stockholders may not act by written consent;\n\u00b7 There are restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or nominate a director for election; and\n\u00b7 Our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.\nThese types of provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to obtain a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 92773, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "PRIM"}
