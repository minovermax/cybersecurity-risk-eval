{"cik": "74260", "company": "OLD REPUBLIC INTERNATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nIn evaluating the Company, the factors described below should be considered carefully. The occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OLD REPUBLIC AND ITS BUSINESSES\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the associated governmental responses could materially adversely affect Old Republic\u2019s business.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the U.S. economy and financial markets. Governmental responses to the pandemic have included shelter-in-place orders, directing many businesses to cease operations and individuals to restrict their movements. These actions have resulted in rapid decreases in economic activity, an increase in unemployment and pressures on the commercial real estate market. For a further discussion of the impact of the pandemic on Old Republic\u2019s business for the year ended December 31, 2020, see \u201cManagement Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations-COVID-19 Pandemic and Old Republic\u2019s Business.\u201d\nIn addition, the pandemic caused significant financial market disruptions, most particularly in the first and second quarters of 2020. This had an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and stock price. While many sectors in which the Company invests have recovered or partially recovered, should the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause economic disruption, the Company\u2019s investment portfolio could experience continued volatility. For more information on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio performance, see \u201cManagement Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations-Financial Position.\u201d\nWhile the duration and ultimate effects of the pandemic remain highly uncertain, COVID-19 continues to have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy, which led to increased or continuing restrictions on business activity. A continuing or worsening reduction in economic activity could lead to a meaningful decline in the demand for the Company\u2019s products. The pandemic could also have a more significant impact on Old Republic\u2019s claims experience in future periods, resulting in a decrease in profitability.\nLegislative and regulatory responses to COVID-19 could adversely affect Old Republic's business.\nFederal, state and local government authorities, including state insurance departments, have taken various actions in response to the pandemic. For example, certain states are considering legislation that would retroactively mandate coverage for losses that are not covered under the terms of insurance policies. Certain state insurance departments are taking regulatory action that creates a presumption of compensability for workers in certain industries. Other regulatory initiatives include requirements to return premium, prevent the collection of premium, and/or prohibit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies. These legislative and regulatory actions, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect Old Republic\u2019s business.\nOld Republic\u2019s loss reserves are based on estimates and if these prove to be inadequate to cover its actual insured losses, Old Republic\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo recognize liabilities for anticipated policy losses, the Company establishes reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing its best estimate of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the related loss adjustment expenses. It is not possible to calculate precisely what these liabilities will amount to in advance and, accordingly, the reserves represent a best estimate at a point in time. Estimating loss reserves is a difficult, complex and inherently uncertain process involving many variables and subjective judgments. These estimates are based upon known historical loss data, assumptions and expectations of future trends in claim frequency and severity, changes in legal, regulatory and litigation environments, and inflation and other economic considerations.\nMoreover, for long-tail coverages, which generally include workers' compensation, commercial automobile (trucking) liability, general liability, errors and omissions and directors\u2019 and officers' liability, as well as title insurance, significant periods of time often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the Company and the payment of that loss. The length of time required to ultimately settle long-tailed claims and the costs associated with resolving these claims, coupled with uncertain and sometimes variable judicial rulings on coverage and policy allocation issues along with the possibility of legislative actions, makes reserving for these exposures highly uncertain and creates a risk of possibly adverse developments in both known and as-yet-unknown claims.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, the ultimate paid loss and loss adjustment expense may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in the Company\u2019s financial statements. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company experienced consolidated favorable development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in prior years of $83.8 million, $30.9 million and $77.8 million, respectively which had a positive effect on results of operations in those periods. To the extent that loss and loss adjustment expenses exceed initial estimates, the Company will be required to immediately recognize the less favorable experience and increase loss reserves, with a corresponding reduction in net income in the period in which the unfavorable development is identified.\nIf the Company is unable to accurately underwrite risks and charge competitive yet profitable rates to its policyholders and customers, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn general, the premiums for the Company\u2019s insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and, therefore, before all of the underlying costs are known. Like other insurance companies, Old Republic relies on estimates and assumptions in setting premium rates. Establishing adequate premiums is necessary to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses and other underwriting costs and to earn an underwriting profit. If the Company does not accurately assess and underwrite the risks that it assumes, it may not charge adequate premiums to cover its losses and expenses, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, the Company could set its premiums too high, which could reduce its competitiveness and lead to lower revenues.\nPricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data, and the projection of future trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of the Company\u2019s products. In order to accurately price its policies, the Company:\n\u25cf collects and analyzes a substantial volume of data from its insureds;\n\u25cf develops, tests and applies appropriate projections and rating formulas;\n\u25cf closely monitors and timely recognizes changes in trends; and;\n\u25cf seeks to project expected losses for its insureds with reasonable accuracy.\nThe Company seeks to implement its pricing accurately in accordance with its assumptions, data available to it and its analysis of that data. Given the uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions, the Company\u2019s ability to undertake these efforts successfully and, as a result, accurately price its policies, is not free from risk.\nIf the Company is unable to realize its investment objectives, its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nInvestment income is an important component of the Company\u2019s net income and one of its primary sources of cash flow to support operations. As of December 31, 2020, the consolidated investment portfolio reflected an allocation of approximately 74% to fixed-maturity (bonds and notes) and short-term investments, and 26% to equity securities (common stock). For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company reported $438.9 million, $450.7 million and $431.8 million of net investment income, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. Changing or unprecedented market conditions, such as experienced in the first half of the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could decrease liquidity and materially impact the future valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities in the investment portfolio.\nIn structuring its investment portfolio, the Company seeks to align its policyholder obligations and the maturity of its fixed maturity portfolio. As a result of either an unexpected increase in policyholder obligations (e.g., because of an underestimate in reserves) or a short fall in funds available (e.g., because of a default in a fixed maturity investment), the Company could have difficulty in meeting its obligations. In this case, the Company could be forced to liquidate its investments before their maturity or under adverse securities market conditions to obtain the funds necessary to meet its obligations. This could result in unexpected losses in the portfolio. Additionally, the Company may be forced to change its investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions, thus affecting the existing or anticipated financial condition and operating needs, including the tax position, of its business. In such circumstances, the Company\u2019s investment objectives may not be achieved, and its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nLosses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties can have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability or sources of liquidity.\nThe Company has credit risk with counterparties associated with investments, premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries have significant business relationships with financial institutions, particularly national banks. These subsidiaries are the beneficiaries of a significant amount of security in the form of letters of credit, trust funds and investments which certain banks hold as collateral securing the obligations of insureds and certain reinsurers. Other banks are depositories holding large sums of money in escrow accounts established by the Company's title subsidiaries. There is thus a risk of concentrated financial exposures in one or more such banking institutions. These counterparties may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. If any of these institutions fail or are unable to honor their credit obligations, or if escrowed funds become lost or tied up due to the failure of a bank, the result could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is also exposed to credit risk with its reinsurers. Reinsurance does not discharge the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries of their obligations under their insurance policies. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries remain liable to policyholders even if they are unable to make recoveries that they believe they are entitled to receive under their reinsurance contracts. With respect to long-tail coverages, the creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s reinsurers may change before it can recover amounts to which it is entitled. If a reinsurer is unable to meet any of its\nobligations to the Company, it would be responsible for all claims and claim settlement expenses for which it would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer. If the Company is unable to collect amounts recoverable from reinsurers, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s status as a holding company with no direct operations could adversely affect its liquidity and its ability to service debt and pay dividends.\nOld Republic is an insurance holding company with no operations of its own that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries. Old Republic\u2019s primary assets are the investments in these operating subsidiaries, and substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets consist of those used for the business conducted by its insurance subsidiaries. Old Republic relies upon dividends and interest from these subsidiaries in order to pay the interest and principal on its debt obligations, dividends to shareholders, and corporate expenses.\nThe payment of dividends by the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. These authorities recognize only statutory accounting practices for determining financial position, results of operations and the ability of an insurer to pay dividends to its shareholders. The specific rules governing the payment of dividends by the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in many different jurisdictions. Generally, the insurance subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends to the holding company in excess of either the greater or lesser of (depending upon the state involved) 10% of statutory surplus or a portion of statutory net income, without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authority. Dividends declared during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to the holding company by its subsidiaries amounted to $472.4 million, $399.5 million and $412.3 million, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s subsidiaries will be able to continue to pay such dividends to us in the future. If the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends to the holding company in amounts necessary to satisfy existing obligations, the Company\u2019s ability to service its debt and pay dividends to its shareholders would be adversely affected.\nOld Republic may not be able to maintain paying dividends at current rates, or at all.\nOld Republic has a long history of paying regular quarterly dividends and in recent years has paid special dividends. Any determination to pay either type of dividend to the Company\u2019s stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. Old Republic\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends largely on the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and operating capital requirements, and is subject to regulatory and other constraints of the subsidiaries, including the effect of any such dividends or distributions on the AM Best rating or other ratings of the insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Company may choose to retain capital to support growth or further mitigate risk, instead of returning excess capital to its shareholders. As a result, there can be no assurance that Old Republic will be able to maintain paying dividends as it has in the past.\nTechnology breaches or failures, including cybersecurity incidents, could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information and expose the Company to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect its reputation and results of operations.\nTo perform day to day operations as well as communicate with customers, business partners and other stakeholders, the Company depends upon an array of digital technologies. The Company\u2019s business depends on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data its information systems use to run its business. The Company uses computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and make use of customer, employee, and company data and information. Some internal processes, in turn, rely upon third-party systems and tools. This combination of resources allow business units to provide insurance quotes, process premium payments, make changes to existing policies, file and pay claims, provide customer support, execute transactions and manage investment portfolios. In addition, the Company routinely transmits, receives and stores personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although the Company attempts to keep this information confidential, it may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, and other third parties.\nThe Company\u2019s systems have in the past been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to cyber threats and other computer related intrusions. Like other large companies, Old Republic is a target of potential cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and disruptions. In some cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected and can remain undetected for some time, increasing the severity of the incident. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s security measures, including information security policies, will provide fully effective protection from such events. Any such cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny information security breach of systems or services or breach of a third-party vendor or services provider that results in the loss or unauthorized access of sensitive data could disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business operations during recovery and any remediation period. In the event of a cyber-attack or other information security incident, systems may be inaccessible to employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time and employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if data or systems are disabled or\ndestroyed. In addition, a successful cyber-attack or similar information security incident could expose the Company to substantial costs and negative consequences including remediation costs, lost revenues and reputational damage.\nFurthermore, Old Republic\u2019s businesses must comply with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, as well as laws enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could expose the Company to liability under federal and state laws, and subject it to litigation and investigations and result in reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may suffer losses from litigation, which could materially and adversely affect its financial condition and business operations.\nLike other large insurance companies, Old Republic continually faces risks associated with litigation of various types, including claims litigation arising in the ordinary course, corporate litigation, and disputes relating to bad faith allegations that could result in the Company incurring losses in excess of policy limits. The Company typically is a party to a variety of litigation matters throughout the year. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and if there were an outcome unfavorable to the Company, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on its results of operations and financial position in the period in which the outcome occurs. Even if an unfavorable outcome does not materialize, the Company still may face substantial expense and disruption associated with the litigation.\nThe Company competes with a large number of companies in the insurance industry for premium revenues.\nEach of the Company's lines of continuing insurance business is highly competitive and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The Company faces competition from specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and intermediaries, as well as diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than it is and that have significantly greater financial, marketing, management and other resources. The Company may also face competition from new sources of capital such as institutional investors seeking access to the insurance market, sometimes referred to as alternative capital, which may depress pricing or limit the Company\u2019s opportunities to write business. The emergence of insurtech companies and other companies that may seek to write business without the appropriate regard for risk and profitability may lead to increased competition for premiums. All of these increases in competition threaten to reduce demand for the Company\u2019s insurance products, reduce its market share and growth prospects, and potentially reduce the Company\u2019s premium revenues and profitability.\nIf the Company is unable to keep pace with the technological advancements in the insurance industry, its ability to compete effectively could be impaired.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely upon complex and expensive information technology systems for interacting with policyholders, brokers and other business partners. The pace at which information systems must be upgraded is continually increasing, requiring an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards. Many of the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries maintain separate IT systems. The Company will need to continue to develop and maintain information technology systems that will allow its insurance subsidiaries to compete effectively. The development of new technologies may result in the Company being competitively disadvantaged if it is unable to upgrade its systems in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to keep pace with the advancements being made in technology, the Company\u2019s ability to compete with other insurance companies that have more advanced technological capabilities will be negatively affected. Further, if the Company is unable to effectively update or replace its key legacy technology systems as they become obsolete or as emerging technology renders them competitively inefficient, the Company\u2019s competitive position and its cost structure could be adversely affected.\nOld Republic is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and if the Company fails to comply with these regulations, it can be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s realization of its business objectives as well as its financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nMost insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders and other investors. These regulations, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and territory in which the Company does business, relate to, among other things, policy forms, premium rates, capital requirements, licensing, investments, policy limits, accounting methods and reserving.\nState insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the conduct and affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual, quarterly and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. At any given time, governmental agencies are examining or investigating certain of the Company\u2019s operations. These include examinations or investigations of market conduct, competitive practices and other regulatory compliance matters. Changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business as currently conducted and adversely affect or inhibit Old Republic\u2019s ability to achieve some or all of its business objectives.\nRegulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including\nthe violation of regulations. In some instances, the Company follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations or practices that it believes may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If the Company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals or does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could initiate investigations or other proceedings, fine the Company, preclude or temporarily suspend the Company from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize the Company. This could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nIn addition to regulations specific to the insurance industry, as a public company, Old Republic is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), each of which regulate many areas such as financial and business disclosures, corporate governance and shareholder matters. Old Republic is also subject to the corporation laws of Delaware, its state of incorporation. At the federal level, among other laws, the Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, each of which regulate corporate governance, executive compensation and other areas, as well as laws relating to federal trade restrictions, privacy/data security and terrorism risk insurance laws. The Company monitors these laws, regulations and rules to assess the Company\u2019s compliance and make appropriate changes as necessary. Implementing such changes may require adjustments to the Company\u2019s business methods, increases to its costs and other changes that could cause the Company to be less competitive in the industry.\nRISKS RELATING TO GENERAL INSURANCE\nCatastrophic losses, including those caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes or man-made events such as terrorist attacks, are inherently unpredictable and could cause the Company to suffer material financial losses.\nWhile the General Insurance segment does not have a meaningful exposure to homeowners or other real property coverages, the casualty or liability insurance it underwrites creates exposure to claims arising out of catastrophes. The two principal catastrophe exposures are earthquakes and acts of terrorism in areas where there are large concentrations of employees of an insured employer or other individuals who could potentially be injured and assert claims against an insured under workers' compensation policies. Collateral damage to property or persons from acts of terrorism and other calamities could also expose general liability policies.\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all reinsurance contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism. As discussed elsewhere in this report, the U.S. Congress subsequently passed TRIA, TRIREA, and TRIPRA legislation that required primary insurers to offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism under most commercial property and casualty insurance policies. Although these programs established a temporary federal reinsurance program through December 31, 2027, primary insurers like the Company\u2019s general insurance subsidiaries retain significant exposure for terrorist act-related losses.\nSince January 1, 2005, the Company has maintained maximum treaty reinsurance coverage of up to $200 million for workers' compensation exposures. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, however, all workers' compensation primary insurers such as the Company remain liable for unlimited amounts in excess of reinsured limits. Therefore, it is possible that in the event of a catastrophe such as an earthquake that could lead to the death or injury of a large number of persons concentrated in a single place, the Company could experience significant non-reinsured losses if the losses exceeded its reinsurance coverage, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, natural events such as the COVID-19 pandemic can have a particular impact on certain business lines. For example, the General Insurance segment writes workers\u2019 compensation business covering the continuing care industry, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on covered individuals in this sector could cause the Company to experience increased claims and losses, which could also materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative trends in employment rates can adversely affect Old Republic\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation business. If the Company\u2019s customers reduce their workforce levels, the level of workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage they require and, as a result the premiums that the Company charges, would be reduced, and if the customer ceases operations, it will not renew its policy. For example, the pandemic's impact on employment levels, businesses, and other economic activities contributed to a reduction in net written and earned premium and fee revenues in the General Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. If the pandemic continues unabated, or current economic conditions do not improve, Old Republic could experience future decreases in business activity, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nIf the Company is not able to obtain reinsurance on favorable terms, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nReinsurance is a contractual arrangement whereby one insurer (the reinsurer) assumes some or all of the risk exposure written by another insurer (the reinsured). The Company depends on reinsurance to manage its risks both in\nterms of the amount of coverage it is able to write, the amount it is able to retain for its own account, and the price at which the Company is able to write it. The availability of reinsurance and its price, however, are generally determined in the reinsurance market by conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nBecause reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its primary liability to insureds in the event of a loss, the ability of reinsurers to honor their counterparty obligations to the Company represents credit risk. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by limiting reinsurance placements to those reinsurers it considers the best credit risks. In recent years, however, there has been an ever decreasing number of acceptable reinsurers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to find the desired or even adequate amounts of reinsurance at favorable rates from acceptable reinsurers in the future. If unable to do so, the Company would have greater exposure to catastrophic losses and be forced to reduce the volume of business written or retain increased amounts of liability exposure. In either case, any reduction or other changes in the Company\u2019s reinsurance could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nLosses due to defaults by insureds with which the Company has entered into risk sharing arrangements could adversely affect its profitability.\nA significant amount of Old Republic's liability and workers' compensation business, particularly for large commercial insureds, is written on the basis of risk sharing underwriting methods. These methods may include the use of large deductibles, captive insurance risk retentions, or other arrangements by which the insureds effectively retain and fund all or a portion of the losses experience. An insured\u2019s financial strength and ability to pay are carefully evaluated as part of the underwriting process and monitored periodically thereafter. In addition, the exposure retained by an insured is estimated and collateralized based on a credit analysis and evaluation. Because the Company is primarily liable for losses incurred under its policies, the failure or inability of insureds to honor their retained liability represents a credit risk. If the Company incorrectly estimates the proper amount of collateral or if there is an impediment to the Company accessing that collateral, it could have a material adverse effect on the General Insurance segment\u2019s profitability, results of operation and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO TITLE INSURANCE\nThe Title segment\u2019s products and services and claims experience may suffer as a result of deteriorations in the real estate market.\nDemand for the products and services provided by the Title segment is generally dependent on the strength of the real estate market and the frequency of real estate transactions. If real estate market conditions and real estate values decline, the number of real estate transactions may decrease, as a result of high or increasing mortgage interest rates and limited or decreasing availability of credit, including commercial and residential mortgage funding. Historically, increasing foreclosure activity has led to an increase in claims. These factors may adversely affect both net premiums and fees earned and profitability in the segment.\nA significant portion of the Title segment\u2019s business is generated by independent title agents and underwritten insurance companies. If this segment\u2019s products and services become less attractive to these independent title agents, or if there is a decrease in the amount of title industry business placed by independent title agents, it could have a material adverse impact on this segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $2.4 billion or 75% of the Title segment\u2019s consolidated premium and related fee income was produced by independent title agents. The other three large national title insurers generate a higher percentage of their business through employees or owned insurance agencies. Independent title agents can direct business to any title insurer, whereas owned agencies will typically direct business solely to their parent or affiliated title insurers. If the products and services provided by competitors are more attractive to independent title agents, or if the number of, or amount of business produced by, independent title agents decreases, the segment\u2019s business may be adversely affected.\nBecause independent title agents issue a significant portion of the Title segments policies and operate with substantial independence from the business, the independent operations of these title agents could adversely affect the financial condition and profitability of this segment.\nThe Title segment issues a significant portion of its policies through title agents that operate largely independently and without direct supervision. The independent agents typically perform title searches and examinations and make underwriting decisions for which the Title segment bears the risk. The activities of these independent title agents are governed by contract. While the Title business has policies to audit and monitor their activities, there is no guarantee that these title agents will fulfill their contractual obligations. For example, an independent agent may issue a policy that is in excess of contractual limits or the independent title agent may not adhere to required underwriting standards. The Title segment\u2019s contracts with agents generally limit an agent\u2019s liability for losses. However, under certain circumstances, the segment may be liable to third parties for actions (including defalcations) or omissions of these agents. In certain states a title insurer may be held liable for the actions or omissions of its agents in those states, regardless of contractual limitations imposed on an agent\u2019s activities. As a result, the use of independent title agents could result in increased claims and an increase in other costs and expenses.\nRegulation of title insurance rates could adversely affect the Title segment.\nTitle insurance rates are subject to extensive regulation, which varies from state to state. In many states the approval of the applicable state insurance regulator is required prior to implementing a rate change. These regulations could hinder the Title segment\u2019s ability to promptly adapt to changing market dynamics through price adjustments, which could adversely affect its results of operations, particularly in a rapidly declining market.\nFlorida represents approximately 19% of the Title segment consolidated premium and related fee income, respectively. The Title segment\u2019s business may be adversely affected by business or regulatory conditions that disproportionately affect Florida.\nFlorida is the largest source of revenue for the Title segment. In the aggregate in 2020, Florida accounted for approximately 19% of total segment consolidated premium and related fee income. As a result of the significant income associated with this state, the Title segment is exposed to adverse business or regulatory conditions that significantly or disproportionally affect this state. For example, a declining business climate or real estate market that is localized in this state could have an adverse effect on the segment\u2019s results of operations. Adverse regulatory developments, including reductions in rates or increased regulatory or capital requirements in this state could similarly adversely affect the segment\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the Company does not obtain reinsurance on certain large commercial title policies, a title failure or other claim on such a policy could adversely affect the Title segment and the Company.\nThe Title segment\u2019s commercial business involves the issuance of title policies on commercial properties. Policies insuring title on large commercial properties (or aggregations of many smaller properties) may have policy exposure extending into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Historically, the segment has not obtained reinsurance on its large commercial policies. Given the large policy limits, a significant loss on one of these policies would have a material adverse effect on the Title segment and the Company.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE RFIG-RUNOFF SEGMENT\nA failure to adequately reserve for losses could materially adversely affect the RFIG Run-off segment.\nThe Company establishes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for its RFIG Run-off segment based upon loans reported by mortgage servicers to be in default, as well as estimates of those in default but not yet reported. The reserves are best estimates by management and take into consideration many variables including the number of reported defaults, the payment status of those defaults, the segment\u2019s historical loss data and management\u2019s assumptions and expectations regarding future trends in housing and mortgage markets, unemployment rates and the economy in general.\nEstimating reserves for mortgage guaranty exposures is an inherently uncertain process insofar as it is based on information reported by third parties and is subject to changes in economic conditions which could have a material impact on ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. See \u201cOld Republic\u2019s loss reserves are based on estimates and if its loss reserves prove to be inadequate to cover its actual insured losses, Old Republic\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected\u201d above.\nClaim reserve estimates for the RFIG Run-off segment rely on the accuracy and timeliness of information provided by mortgage servicers with regards to the number and payment status of mortgage loans in default. Inaccuracies or delays in the reporting of default information could adversely affect the level of carried reserves or the timing in which such reserves or changes therein are recorded. With regard to changes in economic trends and conditions, periods of sustained economic distress such as those experienced during the Great Recession of 2007-2012 or, more recently, by the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, subject estimates of loss reserves to an even greater degree of uncertainty and volatility.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act) introduced foreclosure moratoriums and established a forbearance option for borrowers suffering hardships induced by the pandemic. The RFIG Run-off segment loss reserves take into account expectations regarding the potential mitigating effects of the foreclosure moratoriums and loan forbearance provisions of the CARES Act and other loss mitigation programs implemented by mortgage servicers and governmental agencies which have oversight over mortgage servicing. The impact of the CARES Act or similar loss mitigation programs and efforts on the segment\u2019s ultimate claim costs is unknown and will likely depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic.\nAs a result of these risk factors the rate and severity of actual losses could prove to be greater than expected and could require the Company to effect substantial increases in its loss reserves. Depending upon the magnitude, such increases could have a material adverse impact on the segment\u2019s capital position and the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the actual losses for the RFIG segment will not be materially greater than previously established loss reserves.", "PERMNO": 59396, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "ORI"}
