You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects will likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe majority of our net product revenue come from a relatively small number of customers and products in a limited number of market sectors; if we lose any of these customers or if there are problems in those market sectors, our net product revenue and operating results could decline significantly.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we derived approximately 15% of our revenue from one distributor and approximately 29% of our revenue from two customers, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we derived approximately 73% and 88% of our revenue from CryoStor products, respectively. Due to our acquisitions in 2019, we expect both our revenue concentration related to CryoStor, and our customer concentration to be reduced for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our principal customers may vary from period to period and such customers may not continue to purchase products from us at current levels or at all (particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). Further, the inability of some of our customers to consummate anticipated purchases of our products due to changes in end-user demand, and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns could lead to significant reductions in net product revenue which could harm our business. Because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict (particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indicator of our future performance. Additionally, if revenue declines in a quarter, whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue, adverse economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our results of operations will be harmed because many of our expenses are relatively fixed. In particular, a large portion of our manufacturing costs, our research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are not significantly affected by variations in revenue. Further, our cost of product revenue is dependent on product mix. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet investor expectations, the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nFollowing our acquisitions in 2019, we have increased our fixed costs and now sell products having higher costs of product revenue than our biopreservation media products. We expect that the result of these acquisitions will make it more difficult to predict our revenue and operating results from period-to-period and that, as a result, comparisons of our results of operations are not currently and will not be for the foreseeable future a good indicator of our future performance. For example, if revenue declines in a quarter, whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue, adverse economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our results of operations will be harmed because many of our expenses are now relatively fixed. In particular, a large portion of our manufacturing costs, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses are not significantly affected by variations in revenue. Further, a shift in product revenue concentration away from our CryoStor products and towards our new products with higher costs of product revenue will adversely affect our operating margin. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet investor expectations, the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions or strategic transactions which may require us to seek additional financing or financial commitments, increase our expenses and/or present significant distractions to our management.\nIn fiscal 2019, we acquired three companies and made investments in two other companies. We are continuing to actively evaluate opportunities to grow our portfolio of cell and gene therapy tools. In the event we engage in an acquisition or strategic transaction, including by making an investment in another company, we may need to acquire additional financing. Obtaining financing through the issuance or sale of additional equity and/or debt securities, if possible, may not be at favorable terms and may result in additional dilution to our current stockholders. Additionally, any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, an acquisition or strategic transaction may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including the risks outlined above and additionally:\n\u25cf\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention in order to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u25cf\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u25cf\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u25cf\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u25cf\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, and any transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf intangible assets and goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisitions become impaired, we may have to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for our completed acquisitions in 2019, we recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, including developed technology and customer relationships relating to the acquired product lines, and goodwill. Under U.S. GAAP, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of intangible assets and goodwill has been impaired. Intangible assets and goodwill will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of intangible assets and goodwill will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nOur acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.\nAs a part of our growth strategy, we may make selected acquisitions of complementary products and/or businesses. Any acquisition involves numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating new operations, technologies, products, and personnel;\n\u2022\nproblems maintaining uniform procedures, controls and policies with respect to our financial accounting systems;\n\u2022\nlack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations, including risks associated with entering foreign markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nunderperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;\n\u2022\nnegative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nclaims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;\n\u2022\nthe assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions that dilute the ownership of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions may not be an option if the price of our common stock is low or volatile which could preclude us from completing any such acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business;\n\u2022\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nassumption of, or exposure to, historical liabilities of the acquired business, including unknown contingent or similar liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with acquiring intellectual property, including potential disputes regarding acquired companies\u2019 intellectual property.\nIn addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies. There can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we may make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Our failure to successfully address the foregoing risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all.\nHealthcare reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nThe efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may adversely affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours. Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Efforts by governments and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means may limit our commercial opportunities and adversely affect our operating results and result in a decrease in the price of our common stock or limit our ability to raise capital.\nIf our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned, we could experience lost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality products to our customers. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our products and technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected. Although our products are tested prior to shipment, defects or errors could nonetheless occur in our products. In the future, if our products experience, or are perceived to experience, a material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. Such defects or errors could also narrow the scope of the use of our products, which could hinder our success in the market. Even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any lingering concerns in our target market regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our products could continue to result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, increased service and warranty costs and claims against us.\nWe face significant competition.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive. We anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies may choose to develop new or improved products and as new companies could enter the market with new technologies, any of which could compete with our product or even render our products obsolete. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial, technical, research, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than us. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any that are being developed or marketed by us, or that such competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval, or introducing or commercializing any such products, prior to us. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, even if we can compete successfully, there can be no assurance that we can continue do so in a profitable manner.\nWe are dependent on outside suppliers for all our manufacturing supplies.\nWe rely on outside suppliers for all our manufacturing supplies, parts and components. Although we believe we could develop alternative sources of supply for most of these components within a reasonable period of time, there can be no assurance that, in the future, our current or alternative sources will be able to meet all our demands on a timely basis, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Unavailability of necessary components could require us to re-engineer our products to accommodate available substitutions, which could increase costs to us and/or have a material adverse effect on manufacturing schedules, products performance and market acceptance. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable amount of time, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products, our operations could be disrupted.\nOur success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nIn order to execute our business plan, we must attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial, scientific, manufacturing, and sales personnel. If we fail to attract and retain skilled scientific and sales personnel, our sales efforts will be hindered. Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of key scientific and technical personnel. If we do not attract and retain qualified personnel, we will not be able to achieve our growth objectives.\nDifficulties in manufacturing could have an adverse effect upon our expenses and our product revenues.\nWe currently manufacture all of our biopreservation media products, freezer products and related components. We currently outsource most of the manufacturing of our ThawSTAR and evo products. The manufacturing of our products is difficult and complex. To support our current and prospective clinical customers, we comply with and intend to continue to comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our products. Our ability to adequately manufacture and supply our products in a timely matter is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of third-parties producing raw materials and supplies upon which we rely in our manufacturing. The manufacture of our products may be impacted by:\n\u25cf\navailability or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier;\n\u25cf\nthe ongoing capacity of our facilities;\n\u25cf\nour ability to comply with new regulatory requirements, including our ability to comply with cGMP;\n\u25cf\ninclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u25cf\nchanges in forecasts of future demand for product components;\n\u25cf\npotential facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses;\n\u25cf\nupdating of manufacturing specifications;\n\u25cf\nproduct quality success rates and yields; and\n\u25cf\nglobal viruses and pandemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf efficient manufacture and supply of our products is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments or supply constraints. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to customers, our customers may be unable to supply their end-products incorporating our products to their patients and other customers, which could materially and adversely affect our product revenue and results of operations.\nWhile we are not currently subject to FDA or other regulatory approvals on our products, if we become subject to regulatory requirements, the manufacture and sale of our products may be delayed or prevented, or we may become subject to increased expenses.\nNone of our products are subject to FDA. In particular, we are not required to sponsor formal prospective, controlled clinical-trials to establish safety and efficacy. Additionally, we comply with cGMP requirements. This is done solely to support our current and prospective clinical customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to obtain approval from the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities, as applicable, prior to marketing any of our products in the future. Any such requirements could delay or prevent the sale of our products or may subject us to additional expenses.\nExpiration of our patents may subject us to increased competition and reduce our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our products have varying expiration dates and, when these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs. In some of the larger economic territories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension/restoration may be available. We cannot, however, be certain that an extension will be granted or, if granted, what the applicable time or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extended period will be. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other exclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and non-U.S. patents.\nUS Patent 6,045,990, which provides patent coverage relating to HypoThermosol FRS, expired in April 2019, and its foreign patent counterparts expired in July 2019. This may reduce the barrier to entry for competition for this product, which may materially affect the pricing of HypoThermosol FRS and our ability to retain market share. We hold various trade secrets and other confidential know-how related to the manufacturing and testing of our products which limit our exposure to the expiration of US patent 6,045,990.\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and products.\nOur commercial success will depend on our ability to obtain patents and/or regulatory exclusivity and maintain adequate protection for our technologies and products in the United States and other countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nWe intend to apply for additional patents covering both our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. We may, however, fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion, if at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. In addition, the patent positions of life science industry companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we cannot guarantee that:\n\u25cf\nwe were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u25cf\nwe were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u25cf\nany of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u25cf\nany of our patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u25cf\nany patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties; and\n\u25cf\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable, or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends on many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, unenforceable or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. We also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where it is believed that patent protection is inappropriate or unobtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them and our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all our products in every jurisdiction would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products. These products may compete with our products and may not be covered by any patent claims or other intellectual property rights.\nThe laws of some non-U.S. countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors may take advantage of our ideas and compete directly against us.\nOur success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to secure and protect intellectual property rights and enforce patent and trademark protections relating to our technology. While we believe that the protection of patents and trademarks is important to our business, we also rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, know-how and continuing technological innovation to maintain our competitive position. From time to time, litigation may be advisable to protect our intellectual property position. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Any litigation in this regard could be costly, and it is possible that we will not have sufficient resources to fully pursue litigation or to protect our intellectual property rights. This could result in the rejection or invalidation of our existing and future patents. Any adverse outcome in litigation relating to the validity of our patents, or any failure to pursue litigation or otherwise to protect our patent position, could materially harm our business and financial condition. In addition, confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, and key vendors may not prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technology. It is possible that these agreements will be breached or that they will not be enforceable in every instance, and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Enforcement of these agreements may be costly and time consuming. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents or our licensed patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are invalid or unenforceable and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity or enforceability of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights.\nIf we wish to use the technology claimed in issued and unexpired patents owned by others, we will need to obtain a license from the owner, enter into litigation to challenge the validity or enforceability of the patents or incur the risk of litigation in the event that the owner asserts that we infringed its patents. The failure to obtain a license to technology or the failure to challenge an issued patent that we may require to discover, develop or commercialize our products may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf a third party asserts that we infringed its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could seriously harm our results of operations, financial condition and competitive position, including:\n\u25cf\npatent infringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time consuming to defend, whether or not the claims have merit, and which could delay a product and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our product or technologies infringe a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do; and\n\u25cf\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump-sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license.\nThe biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent, and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and/or that the patent is unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nU.S. patent laws as well as the laws of some foreign jurisdictions provide for provisional rights in published patent applications beginning on the date of publication, including the right to obtain reasonable royalties, if a patent subsequently issues and certain other conditions are met.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology.\nPatent applications filed by third parties that cover technology similar to ours may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party files a U.S. patent application on an invention similar to ours, we may elect to participate in or be drawn into an interference proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend against these claims, whether they are with or without any merit and whether they are resolved in favor of or against us, we may face costly litigation and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. As a result of these disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology, or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.\nOur inability to protect our systems and data from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks, including as a result of breaches of our associated third parties, could affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIn conducting our business, we process, transmit and store sensitive business information and personal information about our customers, vendors, and other parties. This information may include account access credentials, credit and debit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, names and addresses and other types of sensitive business or personal information. Some of this information is also processed and stored by our third-party service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents, including our customers, which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties.\nWe are a regular target of malicious third-party attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities, and/or penetrate or bypass our security measures, in order to gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our associated third parties. Such access could lead to the compromise of sensitive, business, personal or confidential information. As a result, we proactively employ multiple methods at different layers of our systems to defend our systems against intrusion and attack and to protect the data we collect. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats that are designed to breach our systems in order to gain access to confidential information.\nOur computer systems and our associated third parties\u2019 computer systems could be in the future, subject to breach, and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect. Threats to our systems and our associated third parties\u2019 systems can derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties. In addition, denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes, including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities. Our defensive measures may not prevent downtime, unauthorized access or use of sensitive data. Further, while we select our third party service providers carefully, and we seek to ensure that our customers adequately protect their systems and data, we do not control their actions and are not able to oversee their processes. Any problems experienced by our associated third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyber-attacks and security breaches, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and our financial condition.\nWe could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information, such as violation of data privacy laws. We cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data. Any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability, protracted and costly litigation, governmental intervention and fines.\nThe market for our common stock is limited and our stock price is volatile.\nOur common stock, traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, is volatile and has experienced price and volume fluctuations.\nThe market prices of many publicly traded companies, including emerging companies in the life sciences industry, have been, and can be expected to be, highly volatile. The future market price of our common stock could be significantly impacted by numerous factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nFuture sales of our common stock or other fundraising events;\n\u25cf\nSales of our common stock by existing shareholders;\n\u25cf\nChanges in our capital structure, including stock splits or reverse stock splits;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements of technological innovations for new commercial products by our present or potential competitors;\n\u25cf\nDevelopments concerning proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nAdverse results in our field or with clinical tests of our products in customer applications;\n\u25cf\nAdverse litigation;\n\u25cf\nUnfavorable legislation or regulatory decisions;\n\u25cf\nPublic concerns regarding our products;\n\u25cf\nVariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nGeneral trends in the health care industry;\n\u25cf\nGlobal viruses, epidemics and pandemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors outside of our control, including significant market fluctuations.\nA significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is held by two stockholders, and these stockholders therefore have significant influence on us and our corporate actions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, two of our existing stockholders, Taurus4757 GmbH (\u201cTaurus\u201d) and WAVI Holdings AG (\u201cWAVI\u201d), owned, collectively, 4.7 million shares of our common stock, representing 22% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 3.9 million shares of our common stock and options to purchase 68,000 shares of our common stock. Taurus and WAVI were previously secured lenders to our Company, and the chairman of Taurus, Mr. Girschweiler, is a member of our board of directors. Accordingly, these stockholders have had, and will continue to have, significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. In addition, without the consent of these stockholders, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of our board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. Collectively, these provisions could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult or could discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nAny future sales of our securities in the public markets may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through future equity offerings.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock or other securities to decline and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities. In addition to the 3.9 million warrants to purchase shares of our common stock owned by Taurus and WAVI, we have an additional 88,000 warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock outstanding which will be freely tradable upon exercise. We have agreed to use our best efforts to keep a registration statement registering the issuance and resale of many such shares effective during the term of the warrants. In addition, we have a significant number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to other outstanding options and rights. If such shares are issued upon exercise of options, warrants or other rights, or if we issue additional securities in a public offering or a private placement, such sales or any resales of such securities could further adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The sale of a large number of shares of our common stock or other securities also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at the prices that we deem appropriate.\nSecurities or industry analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our business or stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analyst cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports covering us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition and could require us to restate our prior financial statements and issue a non-reliance statement regarding our prior financial disclosures.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is possible that certain transactions or a combination of certain transactions may result in material additional limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nSection 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term, tax-exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. We may be unable to offset our taxable income with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal income tax liability.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud. If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected.\nAs described in Item 9A - Controls and Procedures and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, in connection with the restatement of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with regard to having sufficient technical resources to appropriately analyze and account for complex financial instruments and complex share-based awards. With regard to our prior interpretation of ASC 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\u201d, as it related to the initial classification and subsequent accounting of our registered Warrants as equity instruments dating back to March 2014. Upon a reassessment, we determined that we should have accounted for these Warrants as liabilities instead of equity. This material weakness with regard to lacking sufficient technical resources also affected our ability to appropriately value and account for share based payment instruments with market-based vesting provisions under ASC 718, \u201cStock Compensation\u201d. We determined that we should have used a Monte Carlo simulation to value share based payment instruments with a market-based vesting condition. Given this material weakness, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\nWhile we plan on addressing our material weakness as disclosed herein, elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations or may lose confidence in our reported financial information. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business or have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to remedy this deficiency (or any other future deficiencies) or maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. We can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of our financial statements will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of those controls.\nFurther, in the future, if we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities.\nOur financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe Seattle area, including the location of our corporate headquarters and our media production facility and warehouse, was an early location of coronavirus cases in the U.S. We are currently following the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for our team members and visitors. However, the scale and scope of this pandemic is unknown and the duration of the business disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. While we have implemented specific business continuity plans to reduce the potential impact of COVID-19 and believe that we have sufficient inventory to meet previously forecasted demand for the next six to nine months, there is no guarantee that our continuity plan, once in place, will be successful or that our inventory will meet forecasted or actual demand.\nWe have already experienced certain disruptions to our business such as temporary closure of our offices and similar disruptions may occur for our customers or suppliers that may materially affect our ability to obtain supplies or other components for our products, produce our products or deliver inventory in a timely manner. This would result in lost product revenue, additional costs, or penalties, or damage our reputation. Similarly, COVID-19 could impact our customers and/or suppliers as a result of a health epidemic or other outbreak occurring in other locations which could reduce their demand for our products or their ability to deliver needed supplies for the production of our products. The extent to which COVID-19 or any other health epidemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. Accordingly, COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe restatement of our historical financial statements has consumed a significant amount of our time and resources and may continue to do so.\nAs described herein, we have restated our Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods discussed herein. The restatement process was highly time and resource-intensive and involved substantial attention from management, as well as significant legal and accounting costs. Although we have now completed the restatement, we cannot guarantee that we will have no further inquiries from the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock Market regarding our restated Consolidated Financial Statements or matters relating thereto.\nAny future inquiries from the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock Market as a result of the restatement of our historical financial statements will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our resources in addition to those resources already consumed in connection with the restatement itself.\nFurther, many companies that have been required to restate their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and stockholder lawsuits related thereto.\nNatural disasters, geopolitical unrest, war, terrorism, public health issues or other catastrophic events could disrupt the supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect our operations and performance.\nWe are subject to the risk of disruption by earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, geopolitical unrest, war, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, public health issues, epidemics or pandemics and other events beyond our control and the control of the third parties on which we depend. Any of these catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors or customers, and could decrease demand for our products, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 76038, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BLFS"}
