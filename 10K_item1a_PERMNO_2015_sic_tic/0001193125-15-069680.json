RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.\nDUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION, WESBANCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN BANKING CUSTOMERS AT CURRENT LEVELS.\nWesBanco operates in a highly competitive banking and financial industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes. WesBanco faces banking competition in all the markets it serves from the following:\n\u2022\nlocal, regional and national banks;\n\u2022\nsavings and loans;\n\u2022\ninternet banks;\n\u2022\ncredit unions;\n\u2022\npayday lenders and money services businesses;\n\u2022\nfinance companies; and\n\u2022\nbrokerage firms serving WesBanco\u2019s market areas.\nIn particular, the Bank\u2019s competitors include several major national financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions may have products and services not offered by WesBanco, which may cause current and potential customers to choose those institutions. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits and range and quality of services provided. If WesBanco is unable to attract new and retain current customers, loan and deposit growth could decrease, causing WesBanco\u2019s results of operations and financial condition to be negatively impacted.\nWESBANCO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND ITS TRUST AND INVESTMENT SERVICES SEGMENT AND RETAIN ITS CURRENT CUSTOMERS.\nWesBanco may not be able to attract new and retain current investment management clients due to competition from the following:\n\u2022\ncommercial banks and trust companies;\n\u2022\nmutual fund companies;\n\u2022\ninvestment advisory firms;\n\u2022\nlaw firms;\n\u2022\nbrokerage firms; and\n\u2022\nother financial services companies.\nIts ability to successfully attract and retain investment management clients is dependent upon its ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. Due to changes in economic conditions, the performance of the trust and investment services segment may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in which investment clients\u2019 assets are invested, causing clients to seek other alternative investment options. If WesBanco is not successful, its results from operations and financial position may be negatively impacted.\nCUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE REPAYMENT OF LOANS WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGH INCREASES IN THE PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.\nThe Bank\u2019s customers may default on the repayment of loans, which may negatively impact WesBanco\u2019s earnings due to loss of principal and interest income. Increased operating expenses may result from the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. Collection efforts may or may not be successful causing WesBanco to write off the loan or repossess the collateral securing the loan, which may or may not exceed the balance of the loan.\nWesBanco maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, to provide for probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly, which includes testing certain individual loans as well as collective pools of loans for impairment. This evaluation includes an assessment of actual loss experience within each category of the portfolio, individual commercial and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weakness; current economic events, including employment statistics, trends in bankruptcy filings, and other pertinent factors; industry or geographic concentrations; and regulatory guidance.\nWesBanco\u2019s regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses. Based on their assessment the regulatory agencies may require WesBanco to adjust the allowance for loan losses. These adjustments could negatively impact WesBanco\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN WESBANCO\u2019S MARKET AREAS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS.\nWesBanco Bank serves both individuals and business customers throughout West Virginia, Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The substantial majority of WesBanco\u2019s loan portfolio is to individuals and businesses in these markets. As a result, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of WesBanco are affected by local and regional economic conditions. A downturn in these economies could have a negative impact on WesBanco and the ability of the Bank\u2019s customers to repay their loans. The value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may also decline as the economy declines. As a result, deteriorating economic conditions in these markets could cause a decline in the overall quality of WesBanco\u2019s loan portfolio requiring WesBanco to charge-off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase its allowance for loan losses. A decline in economic conditions in these markets may also force customers to utilize deposits held by WesBanco Bank in order to pay current expenses causing the Bank\u2019s deposit base to shrink. As a result the Bank may have to borrow funds at higher rates in order to meet liquidity needs. Lower oil and gas prices may reduce shale gas activity in the region which may negatively affect local and regional economic conditions. These events may have a negative impact on WesBanco\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nCURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES AND COST OF FUNDS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT WESBANCO\u2019S BANKING BUSINESS.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the business of the Bank. The Bank\u2019s main source of income from operations is net interest income, which is equal to the difference between the interest income received on interest-bearing assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond WesBanco\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. WesBanco Bank\u2019s net interest income can be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates. Changes in relative interest rates may reduce the Bank\u2019s net interest income as the difference between interest income and interest expense decreases. As a result, the Bank has adopted asset and liability management policies to minimize the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of\nloans, investments and funding sources. However, even with these policies in place, WesBanco cannot be certain that changes in interest rates or the shape of the interest rate yield curve will not negatively impact its results of operations or financial position.\nWesBanco\u2019s cost of funds for banking operations may not decrease at the same pace as asset yields, particularly in the current interest rate environment, where certain rates are subject to artificial floors or are close to 0%. Cost of funds also may increase as a result of future general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures. The Bank has traditionally obtained funds principally through deposits and wholesale borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are a cheaper source of funds than borrowings because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for borrowings. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures or otherwise, the value of deposits at the Bank decreases relative to its overall banking operations, the Bank may have to rely more heavily on borrowings as a source of funds in the future.\nSIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN U.S. AND FOREIGN MARKETS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WESBANCO\u2019S EARNINGS.\nThe capital and credit markets have experienced extreme disruption in recent years. These conditions resulted in less liquidity, greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain asset types. In many cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices, security prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. Sustained weakness in business and economic conditions in any or all of the domestic or foreign financial markets could result in credit deterioration in investment securities held by us, rating agency downgrades for such securities or other market factors that (such as lack of liquidity for re-sales, absence of reliable pricing information or unanticipated changes in the competitive market) could result in us having to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in the value of such investment securities, with a corresponding charge against earnings. Furthermore, our pension assets are primarily invested in equity and debt securities, and weakness in capital and credit markets could result in deterioration of these assets, and changes in certain key pension assumptions based on current interest rates, long-term rates of return and other economic or actuarial assumptions may increase minimum funding contributions and future pension expense. If the markets deteriorate further, these conditions may be material to WesBanco\u2019s ability to access capital and may adversely impact results of operations.\nFurther, WesBanco\u2019s trust and investment services income could be impacted by fluctuations in the securities market. A portion of this revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios. If the values of those investment portfolios decline, the Bank\u2019s revenue could be negatively impacted.\nRISKS INHERENT IN MUNICIPAL BONDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WESBANCO\u2019S EARNINGS.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 40% of WesBanco\u2019s total securities portfolio was invested in municipal bonds. Although WesBanco\u2019s municipal portfolio is broadly spread across the U.S., any downturn in the economy of a state or municipality in which WesBanco holds municipal obligations could increase the default risk of the respective debt. In addition, a portion of WesBanco\u2019s municipal portfolio is comprised of Build America bonds. Due to the current government sequester reducing the interest subsidy that the government provides to the issuing municipalities, extraordinary redemption provisions (ERP) may be executed by the municipality if it is in their favor to do so. There is a risk that when an ERP is executed, WesBanco may not recover its amortized cost in the bond if it was purchased at a premium. Credit risks are also prevalent when downgrades of credit ratings are issued by major credit rating agencies, which are caused by creditworthiness issues of both bond insurers and the municipality itself. Credit rating downgrades to a non-investment grade level may force WesBanco to sell a municipal bond at a price where amortized cost may not be recovered. Any of the above default risks, early redemption risks and credit risks could cause WesBanco to take impairment charges, which could be significant, that would negatively impact earnings.\nWESBANCO MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CAUSING ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.\nWhen WesBanco acquires a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. Under current accounting standards, if WesBanco determines that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, it is required to write down the carrying value of these assets. WesBanco conducts an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired. WesBanco completed such an impairment analysis in 2014 and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2014. WesBanco cannot provide assurance that it will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on its shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.\nSUITABLE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO WESBANCO IN THE FUTURE.\nWesBanco continually evaluates opportunities to acquire other businesses. However, WesBanco may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future, which could negatively impact the growth of its business. WesBanco expects that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete to acquire compatible businesses. This competition could increase prices for acquisitions that WesBanco would likely pursue, and its competitors may have greater resources than it does. Also, acquisitions of regulated businesses such as banks are subject to various regulatory approvals. If WesBanco fails to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, it will not be able to consummate an acquisition that it believes is in its best interests.\nWESBANCO IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION.\nWesBanco is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, rather than corporate shareholders. These regulations affect WesBanco\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedure and controls. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect WesBanco in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject WesBanco to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products that could be offered, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on WesBanco\u2019s business, financial condition and result of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, WesBanco had $106.2 million in junior subordinated debt presented as a separate category of long-term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. For regulatory purposes, Trust Preferred Securities totaling $103.0 million underlying such junior subordinated debt are included in Tier 1 capital in accordance with regulatory reporting requirements. On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a rule that retains trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital, but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer qualitative standards. Under the rule, the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements is limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital elements, net of goodwill. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit can be included in Tier 2 capital, subject to restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies to develop new consolidated capital requirements applicable to bank\nholding companies and banks. Rules issued in 2013 will generally exclude trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital beginning in 2015. A grandfather provision will permit bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $15 billion, such as WesBanco, to continue counting existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital until they mature.\nIn addition, new international capital standards known as Basel III, which were implemented by a U.S. federal banking agencies\u2019 joint final rule issued in July 2013, will further increase the minimum capital requirements applicable to WesBanco and WesBanco Bank, which may negatively impact WesBanco and the Bank. Additional information about these changes in capital requirements are described above in \u201cItem 1. Business-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nRegulation of WesBanco and its subsidiaries is expected to continue to expand in scope and complexity in the future. These laws are expected to have the effect of increasing WesBanco\u2019s costs of doing business and reducing its revenues, and may limit its ability to pursue business opportunities or otherwise adversely affect its business and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act and other laws, as well as rules implementing or related to them, may adversely affect WesBanco. Specifically, any governmental or regulatory action having the effect of requiring WesBanco to obtain additional capital could reduce earnings and have a material dilutive effect on current shareholders, including the Dodd-Frank Act source of strength requirement that bank holding companies make capital infusions into a troubled subsidiary bank. Legislation and regulation of debit card fees, credit cards and other bank services, as well as changes in WesBanco\u2019s practices relating to those and other bank services, may affect WesBanco\u2019s revenue and other financial results. Additional information about increased regulation is provided in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d under the headings \u201cSupervision and Regulation,\u201d \u201cHolding Company Regulations,\u201d \u201cCapital Requirements,\u201d \u201cDodd-Frank Act,\u201d and \u201cConsumer Protection Laws.\u201d\nWesBanco is also subject to tax laws and regulations promulgated by the United States government and the states in which it operates. Changes to these laws and regulations or the interpretations of such laws and regulations by taxing authorities could impact future tax expense and the value of deferred tax assets.\nLIMITED AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS AND LIQUIDITY FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM AND OTHER SOURCES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS.\nWesBanco Bank is currently a member bank of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of Pittsburgh, and retains certain short-term borrowings from the FHLB of Cincinnati from prior bank acquisitions, but is no longer considered a member bank of such FHLB. Membership in this system of quasi-governmental, regional home-loan oriented agency banks allows us to participate in various programs offered by the FHLB. We borrow funds from the FHLB, which are secured by a blanket lien on certain residential and commercial mortgage loans, and if applicable, investment securities with collateral values in excess of the outstanding balances. Current and future earnings shortfalls and minimum capital requirements of the FHLB may impact the collateral necessary to secure borrowings and limit the borrowings extended to their member banks, as well as require additional capital contributions by member banks. Should this occur, WesBanco\u2019s short-term liquidity needs could be negatively impacted. If WesBanco was restricted from using FHLB advances due to weakness in the system or with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, WesBanco may be forced to find alternative funding sources. If WesBanco is required to rely more heavily on higher cost funding sources, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover these costs, which would adversely affect WesBanco\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe FHLB of Pittsburgh paid dividends in 2014 at an annualized rate of 3.84% resulting in dividend income of $0.4 million. Beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2014, they repurchased all remaining amounts of excess stock held by member institutions. Both the payment of dividends and repurchase of excess stock were suspended in late 2008 with the stock repurchase restored in late 2010 and the payment of dividends restored in February 2012. The FHLB has noted future dividend payments and capital stock repurchases will continue to be reviewed on a quarterly basis. The FHLB of Pittsburgh stock owned by WesBanco totaled $10.9 million and $10.3 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nA proposal pending approval by the FHLB System regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Authority, would revise membership requirements for future FHLB membership that may result in WesBanco being required to hold additional mortgage-related assets and could negatively impact FHLB advance pricing for its members due to lower earnings.\nWESBANCO\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND ON THE SUCCESSFUL GROWTH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES.\nWesBanco\u2019s primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of its banking and other subsidiaries. Therefore, WesBanco\u2019s future profitability will depend on the success and growth of these subsidiaries. In the future, part of WesBanco\u2019s growth may come from buying other banks and buying or establishing other companies. Such entities may not be profitable after they are purchased or established, and they may lose money or be dilutive to earnings per share, particularly for the first few years. A new bank or company may bring with it unexpected liabilities, bad loans, or poor employee relations, or the new bank or company may lose customers and the associated revenue. Dilution of book and tangible book value may occur as a result of the acquisition that may not be earned back for several years, if at all.\nWESBANCO\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IS LIMITED, AND COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS MAY HAVE TO BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED.\nHolders of shares of WesBanco\u2019s common stock are entitled to dividends if, when, and as declared by WesBanco\u2019s Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. Although the Board of Directors has declared cash dividends in the past, the current ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank. Federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, which restrictions are more fully described in \u201cItem 1. Business-Payment of Dividends.\u201d In general, future dividend policy is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including WesBanco\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s future earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, regulatory constraints and financial condition.\nWESBANCO MAY ENCOUNTER INTEGRATION DIFFICULTIES OR MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ACQUISITIONS.\nWesBanco may not be able to integrate any new acquisitions without encountering difficulties including, without limitation, the loss of key employees and customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Any future acquisitions may also result in other unforeseen difficulties, including integration of the combined companies, which could require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed at developing our existing business, and expenses may be higher than initially projected. In addition, we could discover undisclosed liabilities resulting from any acquisitions, for which we may become responsible. Further, benefits such as enhanced earnings that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop and future results of the combined companies may be materially lower from those estimated.\nWesBanco recently completed the acquisition of ESB on February 10, 2015 and integration issues such as those described above could be experienced as a result.\nHIGHER FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND ASSESSMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT WESBANCO\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nSince 2008, the economic environment caused higher levels of bank failures, which dramatically increased FDIC resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the deposit insurance fund. In order to restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has in the past few years significantly increased the assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance. In addition, in May 2009, the FDIC imposed a special\nassessment on all insured institutions, and in November 2009, it adopted a rule requiring banks to prepay their FDIC assessments for years through 2012, which accompanied a rate increase beginning in 2011. While the Deposit Insurance Fund balance has significantly improved since then, and a new assessment base that reduced rates for community banks was adopted in 2011, the FDIC has indicated that future special assessments are possible, although it has not determined the magnitude or timing of any future assessments. Additional increases in FDIC insurance premiums and future special assessments may adversely affect WesBanco\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nINTERRUPTION TO OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR BREACHES IN SECURITY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT WESBANCO\u2019S OPERATIONS.\nWesBanco relies on information systems and communications for operating and monitoring all major aspects of business, as well as internal management functions. Any failure, interruption, intrusion or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the WesBanco customer relationship, management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While WesBanco has policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption, intrusion or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that the above-noted issues will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.\nThere have been several cyber-attacks on websites of large financial services companies. Even if not directed at WesBanco specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of WesBanco\u2019s business.\nCyber-attacks on third party retailers or other business establishments that widely accept debit card or check payments could compromise sensitive bank customer information, such as debit card and account numbers. Such an attack could result in significant costs to the bank, such as costs to reimburse customers, reissue debit cards and open new customer accounts.\nIn addition, there have been efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as \u201cphishing.\u201d The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. Because the techniques used to attack financial services company communications and information systems change frequently (and generally increase in sophistication), often attacks are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to address these techniques in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventative measures.\nThe occurrence of any such failure, disruption or security breach of WesBanco\u2019s information systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to our customers, could damage WesBanco\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject WesBanco to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose WesBanco to civil litigation and possible financial liability. In addition, the prevalence of cyber-attacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems has led, and will continue to lead, to costs to WesBanco with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks, as well as costs reimbursing customers for losses suffered as a result of these actions. Successful attacks or systems failures at other large financial institutions, whether or not WesBanco is included, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions with a potential negative impact on WesBanco\u2019s business, additional demands on the part of our regulators, and increased costs to deal with risks identified as a result of the problems affecting others. The risks described above could have a material effect on WesBanco\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES COULD IMPACT GROWTH AND EARNINGS AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON BUSINESS.\nOur operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth are highly dependent on the services, managerial abilities and performance of our key employees, including executive officers and senior management. Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of this management and personnel. The loss of services, or the inability to successfully complete planned transitions of key personnel approaching normal retirement age, could have an adverse impact on WesBanco\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition because of their skills, knowledge of the local markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nFOLLOWING THE ESB MERGER, A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO REMAINS IN WEST VIRGINIA, OHIO, AND PENNSYLVANIA AND IN COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. DETERIORATIONS IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THIS AREA OR IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET GENERALLY COULD BE MORE HARMFUL TO THE COMBINED COMPANY COMPARED TO MORE DIVERSIFIED INSTITUTIONS.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 23% of WesBanco\u2019s loan portfolio was comprised of residential real estate loans, and 48% was comprised of commercial real estate loans. As a result of our merger with ESB, the combined company\u2019s loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2014, would have been approximately 28% residential real estate loans and 42% commercial real estate loans.\nInherent risks of commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) lending include the cyclical nature of the real estate market, construction risk and interest rate risk. The cyclical nature of real estate markets can cause CRE loans to suffer considerable distress. During these times of distress, a property\u2019s performance can be negatively affected by tenants\u2019 deteriorating credit strength and lease expirations in times of softening demand caused by economic deterioration or over-supply conditions. Even if borrowers are able to meet their payment obligations, they may find it difficult to refinance their full loan amounts at maturity due to declines in property value. Other risks associated with CRE lending include regulatory changes and environmental liability. Regulatory changes in tax legislation, zoning or similar external conditions including environmental liability may affect property values and the economic feasibility of existing and proposed real estate projects.\nThe combined company\u2019s CRE loan portfolio is concentrated in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. There are a wide variety of economic conditions within the local markets of the three states in which most of the combined company\u2019s CRE loan portfolio will be situated. Rates of employment, consumer loan demand, household formation, and the level of economic activity can vary widely from state to state and among metropolitan areas, cities and towns. Metropolitan markets comprise various submarkets where property values and demand can be affected by many factors, such as demographic makeup, geographic features, transportation, recreation, local government, school systems, utility infrastructure, tax burden, building-stock age, zoning and building codes, and available land for development. Despite the merger, as a result of the continued high concentration of the combined company\u2019s loan portfolio, the combined company may be more sensitive, compared to more diversified institutions, to future disruptions in, and deterioration of, this market, which could lead to losses which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company.\nWESBANCO MAY NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, BUT CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR AT ACCEPTABLE TERMS.\nFederal and state banking regulators require WesBanco and its banking subsidiary, WesBanco Bank, to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. In addition, in the future WesBanco may need to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or WesBanco may otherwise elect to raise additional capital in anticipation of future growth opportunities.\nWesBanco\u2019s ability to raise additional capital for parent company or banking subsidiary needs will depend on conditions at that time in the capital markets, overall economic conditions, WesBanco\u2019s financial performance and condition, and other factors, many of which are outside our control. There is no assurance that, if needed, WesBanco will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all. An inability to raise additional capital may have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand operations, and on our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.", "PERMNO": 11293, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WSBC"}
