{"cik": "780571", "company": "ITRON, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe are dependent on the utility industry, which has lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles and has experienced volatility in capital spending, each of which has and could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from sales of products and services to utilities. Purchases of our products may be deferred as a result of many factors, including economic downturns, slowdowns in new residential and commercial construction, customers' access to capital upon acceptable terms, the timing and availability of government subsidies or other incentives, utility specific financial circumstances, mergers and acquisitions, regulatory decisions, weather conditions and climate change, and fluctuating interest rates. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, variability in operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis as a result of these factors.\nThe industries in which we sell our products and services, in particular the utility industry, are subject to substantial government regulation. For example, regulations have often influenced the frequency of customer meter replacements. Sales cycles for our standalone meter products have typically been based on annual or biennial bid-based agreements. Utilities place purchase orders against these agreements as their inventories decline, which can create fluctuations in our sales volumes.\nSales cycles for smart metering solutions are generally long and unpredictable due to several factors, including budgeting, purchasing, and regulatory approval processes that can take several years to complete. Our utility customers typically issue requests for quotes and proposals, establish evaluation processes, review different technical options with vendors, analyze performance and cost/benefit justifications, and perform a regulatory review, in addition to applying the normal budget approval process. Today, governments around the world are implementing new laws and regulations to promote increased energy efficiency, slow or reverse growth in the consumption of scarce resources, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and protect the environment. Many of the legislative and regulatory initiatives encourage utilities to develop a smart grid infrastructure, and some of these initiatives provide for government subsidies, grants, or other incentives to utilities and other participants in their industry to promote transition to smart grid technologies. If government regulations regarding the smart grid and smart metering are delayed, revised to permit lower or different investment levels in metering infrastructure, or terminated altogether, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, cash flow, and financial condition.\nWe must continually shift and adapt our products and services mix, which requires substantial judgment and investment.\nOur market is characterized by increasing complexity driven by evolving technology, increased industry regulatory pressures, and the emergence of new competitive products, all of which impact the manner in which our products and services are designed, developed, marketed, and delivered. The shift in, and increasing complexity of, our products and services mix involves judgment and entails risks. In order to successfully design and develop more complex offerings, we must anticipate the right products, solutions, and technologies to meet estimated market demands. These estimates may prove wrong. Additionally, our complex offerings may contain defects when they are first introduced; their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product and service design and development; or they may have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems. We may not be able to successfully design workarounds. Any shift in, or increased complexity of, our products and services mix may not be easily understood or adopted by our current or future customers, who may be reluctant to buy, or may delay purchases of, our products and services.\nAdditionally, our evolving product mix could cause us to incur substantial additional costs if we need to materially improve our manufacturing infrastructure, develop new systems to deliver our services, or fundamentally change the way in which we deliver services. Also, if one of our new offerings were competitive to our prior offerings and represented an adequate or superior alternative, customers could decide to abandon prior offerings that produce higher revenue or better margins than the new offering. Therefore, the adaptation to new technologies or standards or the development and launch of new products or services could result in lower revenue, lower margins, and/or higher costs, which could unfavorably impact our financial performance.\nWe have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and such effects could have an adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe have experienced disruptions to our business from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographic markets is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. This includes how it may impact our customers, employees, vendors, strategic partners, managed services, and manufacturing\noperations. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption, which may materially and adversely affect our business operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe impact of the virus on third parties on which we rely, such as our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, and strategic partners, cannot be fully known or controlled by us. As a result, we may experience difficulties sourcing components, sub-assemblies, outsourced finished goods, and other products and services. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and demand for our products is also uncertain. Due to resulting financial constraints, illness within their organizations, quarantine and travel restrictions placed upon our customers\u2019 employees, as well as individual actions our customers may take in response to the spread of COVID-19, our customers may have difficulty in making timely payments to us or may have an inability or unwillingness to purchase our products and services. Also, certain of our projects require regulatory approvals, and our customers may experience delays in regulatory approvals. Any of these effects may materially and adversely affect us.\nWe continue to take measures, both voluntary and as a result of government directives and guidance, to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us and others. These measures include, among others, restrictions on our employees' access to our physical work locations and the purchase of personal protective equipment. Additionally, we may implement the temporary closure or reduction in operations of certain of our facilities, which is disruptive to our operations. We have also implemented measures to allow certain employees to work remotely, which may place a burden on our IT systems and may expose us to increased vulnerability to cyber-attack and other cyber-disruption. Many of these measures may result in incremental costs to us, and such costs may not be recoverable or adequately covered by our insurance. Further, any focus by our management on mitigating COVID-19 effects has required, and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources, which may delay other value-add initiatives.\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to numerous government jurisdictions at all levels that are addressing COVID-19 differently. The guidance and directives provided by these governmental authorities is difficult to predict, may be unclear in their application, and are unknown in duration. This includes uncertainty in governmental authorities\u2019 assessments of our business as \"essential\". If governmental authorities were to reverse their designation of our business as \"essential\", it could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the worldwide credit and financial markets, which could limit our ability to obtain external financing on acceptable terms or at all. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, the duration and severity of any further economic or market impact of the pandemic remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to access capital markets, in the future.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict at this time, including: medical advancements to treat or stop the virus including the effectiveness, widespread availability and application of any vaccine, governmental, business, and other actions (which could include limitations on our operations to provide products or services); the duration and severity of the outbreak, including due to reinfections or mutation of the virus, and the related limitations on our ability to conduct business; or the length of time and velocity at which we will return to more normalized operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, vendors, strategic partners, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could materially and adversely impact us. The impact of COVID-19 may also include possible impairment or other charges and may exacerbate other risks discussed herein, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nWe face competition which may result in a loss of market share or price erosion of our products and services.\nWe face competitive pressures from a variety of companies in each of the markets we serve. Some of our present and potential future competitors have, or may have, substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, or manufacturing resources and, in some cases, have greater name recognition, customer relationships, and experience. These competitors may sell products and services at lower prices in order to gain or grow market share, be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and may have made or make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers. Other companies may also drive technological innovation and develop products and services that are equal in quality and performance or superior to our products and services, which could reduce our market position, reduce our overall sales, and require us to invest additional funds in new technology development. In addition, our products and services may experience price erosion if low-cost providers expand their presence in our markets, improve their quality, or form alliances or cooperative relationships with our competitors or if our products and services become commoditized. For example, some utilities may purchase meters\nseparately from the communication devices. The specifications for such meters may require interchangeability, which could lead to further commoditization of the meter, driving prices lower and reducing margins. Pricing pressure is also driven by other events outside our control, to include movement away from manually read meters, government programs, and new construction. Should we fail to compete successfully with current or future competitors, or to adequately manage pricing pressure, we could experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we cannot continue to invest in developing competitive products and services, we will not be able to compete effectively.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to develop, design and manufacture competitive products and services, enhance and sustain our existing products and services, keep pace with technological advances and changing customer requirements, gain international market acceptance, and manage other factors in the markets in which we sell our products and services. Product and service development will require continued investment in order to maintain our competitive position, and the periods in which we incur significant research and development costs may drive variability in our quarterly results. We may not have the necessary capital, or access to capital at acceptable terms, to make these investments. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in technology development. However, we may experience unforeseen problems in the development or performance of our technologies or products, which can prevent us from meeting our research and development schedules. New products often require certifications or regulatory approvals before the products can be used, and we cannot be certain that our new products will be approved in a timely manner, or at all. Finally, we may not achieve market acceptance of our new products and services.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted if key vendors, strategic partners, and other third parties fail to perform.\nCertain of our products, subassemblies, and system components, including most of our circuit boards, are procured from limited or sole sources. We cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with these sources, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs, vendors' access to capital, and increased lead times. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters and pandemics, component or material shortages, cost increases, or other similar problems. Further, in order to minimize their inventory risk, our manufacturers might not order components from third-party suppliers with adequate lead time, thereby impacting our ability to meet our demand forecast. If we fail to manage our relationship with our manufacturers effectively, or if they experience operational difficulties, our ability to ship products to our customers and distributors could be impaired, and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed. In the event that we receive shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards, and we are not able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk revenue losses from the inability to sell those products, increased administrative and shipping costs, and lower profitability. Additionally, if defects are not discovered until after consumers take delivery of our products, they could lose confidence in the technical attributes of our products, and our business could be harmed. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, we may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While we rely on partners to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\nDelays in the availability of or shortages in raw materials and component parts used in the manufacture of our products could unfavorably impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are impacted by the availability and prices of raw materials and component parts used in the manufacturing process of our products. Raw materials include purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components. There are multiple sources for these raw materials and components, but we sometimes rely on single suppliers for certain of these materials. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, including reduced revenue, lower profit margins, and delays in deliveries to customers, which could result in damages or penalties to be paid under the terms of certain of our customer contracts. Since we do not control the production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control. World commodity markets, inflation, tariffs or embargoes may also affect the availability or prices of raw materials or component parts.\nIf we are unable to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction, demand for our products and services could suffer.\nWe believe that our success depends on our ability to understand and address our customers' requirements and concerns. This includes our ability to effectively articulate and demonstrate to customers how our products and services meet their needs and to deliver our products timely as committed, with a sufficient level of quality. In addition, we continue to work toward easing general concerns about the safety and perceived health risks of using radio frequency communications, as well as privacy concerns of monitoring home appliance energy usage, which have had some adverse publicity in the past. If we are unable to overcome these real and perceived risks, we could face customer dissatisfaction, dilution of our brand, decreased overall demand for our services, and loss of revenue. In addition, our inability to meet customer performance, safety, and service expectations may damage our reputation and could consequently limit our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and unfavorably impact our operating results.\nProduct defects could disrupt our operations and result in harm to our reputation and financial position.\nOur products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design, materials, deployment, and/or use. If any of our products contain a defect, a compatibility or interoperability issue, or other types of errors, we may have to devote significant time and resources to identify and correct the issue. We provide product warranties for varying lengths of time and establish allowances in anticipation of warranty expenses. In addition, we recognize contingent liabilities for additional product-failure related costs. These warranty and related product-failure allowances may be inadequate due to product defects and unanticipated component failures, as well as higher than anticipated material, labor, and other costs we may incur to replace projected product failures. A product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive; damage our reputation and relationships with utilities, meter and communication vendors, other third-party vendors, or regulatory entities; result in the loss of business to competitors; or result in litigation. We may incur additional warranty expenses in the future with respect to new or established products, which could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our business.\nOur worldwide operations could be subject to hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics, geopolitical instability, or other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur key manufacturing facilities are concentrated, and in the event of a significant interruption in production at any of our manufacturing facilities, considerable expense, time, and effort could be required to establish alternative production lines to meet contractual obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAsset impairment could result in significant changes that would adversely impact our future operating results.\nWe have significant inventory, intangible assets, long-lived assets, and goodwill that are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets include the following:\n\u2022reduction in the net realizable value of inventory, which becomes obsolete or exceeds anticipated demand;\n\u2022changes in our organization or management reporting structure, which could result in additional reporting units, requiring greater aggregation or disaggregation in our analysis by reporting unit and potentially alternative methods/assumptions of estimating fair values;\n\u2022underperformance relative to projected future operating results;\n\u2022changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u2022unfavorable industry or economic trends; and\n\u2022decline in our stock price for a sustained period or decline in our market capitalization below net book value.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel who are critical to the success of our business could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business.\nOur success depends in large part on the efforts of our highly qualified technical and management personnel and highly skilled individuals in all disciplines. The loss of one or more of these employees and the inability to attract and retain qualified\nreplacements could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, as our products and services become more technologically complex, it could become especially difficult to recruit or retain personnel with unique in-demand skills and knowledge, whom we would expect to become recruiting targets for our competitors and for other companies relying on similar talent. There is no assurance that we will be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel, and this failure could diminish our ability to develop and deliver new products and services, which could cause our operations and financial results to be unfavorably impacted.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are subject to interpretation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various bodies formed to create and interpret appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a material effect on our reported results, as well as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported results.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Organization\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operational flexibility and prevent us from raising additional capital or meeting our obligations under our debt instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total outstanding indebtedness was $936.1 million as described under Liquidity and Capital Resources. This substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow used in operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022requiring us to meet specified financial ratios, a failure of which may result in restrictions on us and our subsidiaries to take certain actions or result in the declaration of an event of default, which if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of required payments against such indebtedness and result in cross defaults under our other indebtedness;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased market interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, as unhedged borrowings under the 2018 credit facility would be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors who may have less debt.\nOur 2018 credit facility, as amended, and Senior Notes place restrictions on our ability, and the ability of many of our subsidiaries, dependent on meeting specified financial ratios, to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur more debt;\n\u2022 pay dividends, make distributions, and repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 create liens;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 enter into sale lease-back transactions; and\n\u2022 merge or consolidate;\n\u2022 transfer or sell assets.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and/or to refinance our indebtedness depends on, and is subject to, our financial and operating performance, which is influenced in part by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, counterparty business, and other risks that are beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the U.S. banking system and capital markets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, to refinance our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at\nsuch time. Even if refinancing indebtedness is available, any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations.\nMoreover, in the event of a default under any of our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which in turn could result in cross defaults under our other indebtedness. The lenders under the 2018 credit facility could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans, and such lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach our covenants under the 2018 credit facility, we would be in default thereunder. Such lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nAlthough our debt instruments contain certain restrictions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, including that certain trade payables do not constitute indebtedness. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, the risks described above and others described herein may increase.\nOur strategy includes acquisitions, divestitures, and investments, which we may not be able to execute or integrate successfully.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we may conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, and equity investments. We have completed acquisitions and may make investments in the future, both within and outside of the United States. We may also, if appropriate opportunities present themselves, make divestitures. Acquisitions, investments, and divestitures involve numerous risks such as the diversion of senior management's attention; unsuccessful integration of the acquired or disintegration of the divested entity's personnel, operations, technologies, and products; unidentified or identified but un-indemnified pre-closing liabilities that we may be responsible for; incurrence of significant expenses to meet an acquiree's customer contractual commitments; lack of market acceptance of new services and technologies; difficulties in operating businesses in international legal jurisdictions; or transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Failure to adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of resources and adversely impact our ability to manage our business. In addition, acquisitions and investments in third parties may involve the assumption of obligations, significant write-offs, or other charges associated with the acquisition or investment. Impairment of an investment, goodwill, or an intangible asset may result if these risks were to materialize. For investments in entities that are not wholly owned by Itron, such as joint ventures, a loss of control as defined by GAAP could result in a significant change in accounting treatment and a change in the carrying value of the entity. There can be no assurances that an acquired business will perform as expected, accomplish our strategic objectives, or generate significant revenues, profits, or cash flows. Any divestiture could result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities, or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities following any such divestiture. For example, in connection with a divestiture, we may enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships, including long-term commercial arrangements, sales arrangements, or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in any such transaction, which may result in additional expense and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer contracts are complex and contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, and/or incur unanticipated expenses with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services.\nIn addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. Some of these contracts contain long-term commitments to a set schedule of delivery or performance and require us to deliver standby letters of credit or bonds as a guarantee to the customer for our future performance. If we failed in our estimated schedule or we fail in our management of the project, this may cause delays in completion. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, if we were to determine that products and/or services to be delivered under a specific component of a customer contract would result in a loss due to expected revenues estimated to be less than expected costs, we could be required to recognize a reduction of revenue in the period we made such determination, and such reduction could be material to our results of operations.\nWe are subject to international business uncertainties, obstacles to the repatriation of earnings, and foreign currency fluctuations.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is derived from operations conducted outside the United States. International sales and operations may be subjected to risks such as the imposition of government controls, government expropriation of facilities, lack of a well-established system of laws and enforcement of those laws, access to a legal system free of undue influence or corruption, political instability, terrorist activities, restrictions on the import or export of critical technology, currency exchange rate fluctuations, or adverse tax burdens.\nOur business is also subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations, particularly with respect to the euro, Canadian dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Pound sterling, and various other currencies. Change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. dollar, or euro, could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. The translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. As the U.S. dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business, revenue and income can be impacted, include revenue decreases due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business, could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in international markets and our sales growth in future periods.\nOther risks related to our international operations include lack of availability of qualified third-party financing, generally longer receivable collection periods than those commonly practiced in the United States, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs, labor disruptions, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, difficulties in imposing and enforcing operational and financial controls at international locations, potential insolvency of international distributors, preference for local vendors, burdens of complying with different permitting standards and a wide variety of foreign laws, and obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash all present additional risk to our international operations.\nInternational expansion and market acceptance depend on our ability to modify our technology to take into account such factors as the applicable regulatory and business environment, labor costs, and other economic conditions. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our products or technologies in the same manner as the laws of the United States. Further, foreign regulations or restrictions, e.g., opposition from unions or works councils, could delay, limit, or disallow significant operating decisions made by our management, including decisions to exit certain businesses, close certain manufacturing locations, or other restructuring actions. There can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and, consequently, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from current or any future restructuring projects and such activities could cause us to incur additional charges in our efforts to improve profitability.\nWe have implemented multiple restructuring projects to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities reduce our available employee talent, assets, and other resources, which could slow research and development, impact ability to respond to customers, increase quality issues, temporarily reduce manufacturing efficiencies, and limit our ability to increase production quickly. In addition, delays in implementing restructuring projects, unexpected costs, unfavorable negotiations with works councils or matters involving third-party service providers, our failure to retain key employees, changes in governmental policies or regulatory matters, adverse market conditions, or failure to meet targeted improvements could change the timing or reduce the overall savings realized from the restructuring project.\nThe successful implementation and execution of our restructuring projects are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth. If our restructuring projects are not executed successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, cash flow, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that our auditors attest to the operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement for\neach fiscal year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting, data systems, and controls across our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, an important part of our growth strategy has been, and will likely continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and our business grows. Likewise, the complexity of our transactions, systems, and controls may become more difficult to manage. In addition, new accounting standards may have a significant impact on our financial statements in future periods, requiring new or enhanced controls. We cannot be certain that we won't experience deficiencies in the design, implementation, and maintenance of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially for acquisition targets that may not have been required to be in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act at the date of acquisition.\nFailure to implement new controls or enhancements to controls, difficulties encountered in control implementation or operation, or difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could result in additional errors, material misstatements, or delays in our financial reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an unfavorable effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\nWe may encounter strikes or other labor disruptions that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant operations throughout the world. In a number of countries outside the U.S., our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. As the result of various corporate or operational actions, which our management has undertaken or may be made in the future, we could encounter labor disruptions. These disruptions may be subject to local media coverage, which could damage our reputation. Additionally, the disruptions could delay our ability to meet customer orders and could adversely affect our results of operations. Any labor disruptions could also have an impact on our other employees. Employee morale and productivity could suffer, and we may lose valued employees whom we wish to retain.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits from strategic alliances, which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe have several strategic alliances with large, complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in shared growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must both compete and collaborate with the same company from one market to the next. Should our strategic partnerships fail to perform, we could experience delays in research and development or experience other operational difficulties.\nWe are exposed to counterparty default risks with our financial institutions and insurance providers.\nIf one or more of the depository institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and we could face material liquidity problems and financial losses.\nThe lenders of our 2018 credit facility consist of several participating financial institutions. Our revolving line of credit allows us to provide letters of credit in support of our obligations for customer contracts and provides additional liquidity. If our lenders were unable to honor their line of credit commitments due to the loss of a participating financial institution or other circumstance, we would need to seek alternative financing, which may not be under acceptable terms, and therefore could adversely impact our ability to successfully bid on future sales contracts and adversely impact our liquidity and ability to fund some of our internal initiatives or future acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may need to expend significant resources to enforce our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nWhile we believe our patents and other intellectual property have significant value, it is uncertain that this intellectual property or any intellectual property acquired or developed by us in the future will provide meaningful competitive advantages. There can be no assurance our patents or pending applications will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by competitors or that rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful proprietary protection. Moreover, competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. To combat infringement or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, we may need to commence litigation, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding\na court may decide that a patent or other intellectual property right of ours is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology or other intellectual property right at issue on the grounds that it is non-infringing or the legal requirements for an injunction have not been met. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries that do not protect such rights in the same manner as in the United States.\nWe may face losses associated with alleged unauthorized use of third-party intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding alleged unauthorized use of a third-party's intellectual property. An adverse outcome in any intellectual property litigation or negotiation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, require us to comply with injunctions to cease marketing or the use of certain products or brands, or require us to redesign, re-engineer, or rebrand certain products or packaging, any of which could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may not be able to acquire these licenses at acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the cost of responding to an intellectual property infringement claim, in terms of legal fees, expenses, and the diversion of management resources, whether or not the claim is valid, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer. We generally indemnify our customers with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure and network against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security incidents caused by unauthorized access, we could be exposed to an increase risk of customer liability and reputational damage.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to capture, process, store, and report data and interact with customers, vendors, and employees. Despite taking security steps to secure all information and transactions, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, may be subject to corruption from cyber-attacks, or other network security incidents. Any unauthorized access to data could result in misappropriation of the data or disruption of operations. In addition, hardware, operating system software, software libraries, and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacturing that could interfere with the operation of the systems. Misuse of internal applications; theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other corporate assets; and inappropriate disclosure of confidential or personal information could stem from such incidents.\nIn addition, an increasing number of our products and services connect to and are part of the IIoT, the Internet, and public cloud services. As such, the products and services we offer may involve the transmission of large amounts of sensitive and proprietary information over public and private communications networks, as well as the processing and storage of confidential and personal customer data. While we attempt to provide adequate security measures to safeguard our products and services, techniques used to gain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving and therefore may not be recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized access, remnant data exposure, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, accidents, employee error or malfeasance, intentional misconduct by computer \"hackers\", and other disruptions can occur. This can lead to gaps in infrastructure, hardware and software vulnerabilities, and security controls. The exposed or unprotected data can (i) interfere with the delivery of services to our customers, (ii) impede our customers' ability to do business, or (iii) compromise the security of systems and data, which exposes information to unauthorized third-parties. Like many companies, we are the target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Although such cyber-attacks have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in future security incidents.\nSecurity incidents that occur could expose us to an increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs. Depending on the jurisdiction, security incidents could trigger notice requirements to impacted individuals and regulatory investigations leading to penalties and increased reputational harm.\nAny such operational disruption and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, unfavorable publicity, product recalls or business delays and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems that may fail to operate effectively, require upgrades and replacements or experience breaches.\nOur industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructures, which may be subject to disruptions arising from events that are beyond our control. We are dependent on information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications, and outsourced services. We continually enhance and implement new systems and processes throughout our global operations.\nWe offer managed services and software utilizing several data center facilities located worldwide. Any damage to, or failure of, these systems could result in interruptions in the services we provide to our utility customers. As we continue to add capacity to our existing and future data centers, we may move or transfer data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any delayed or unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services to our utility customers. We also sell vending and pre-payment systems with security features that, if compromised, may lead to claims against us.\nWe have a primary enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that maintains sales and transactional information to facilitate processes. This system may require updates and upgrades periodically that could be expensive and time consuming undertakings. Successful upgrades and updates provide many benefits, while unsuccessful upgrades and updates may cost us significant time and resources.\nThe failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems due to computer viruses, hacking, acts of terrorism, and other causes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain and production facilities, achieve accuracy in the conversion of electronic data and records, and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. In addition, due to the systemic internal control features within ERP systems, we may experience difficulties that could affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nThe 2018 credit facility bears, and other indebtedness we may incur in the future may bear, interest at a variable rate. As a result, at any given time interest rates on the 2018 credit facility and any other variable rate debt could be higher or lower than current levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness may increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and therefore net income and associated cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, may correspondingly decrease. While we continually monitor and assess our interest rate risk and have entered into derivative instruments to manage such risk, these instruments could be ineffective at mitigating all or a part of our risk, including changes to the applicable margin under our 2018 credit facility.\nThe alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs.\nCertain of our interest rate derivatives and a portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR, which is subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. However, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited announced its plan to extend the date that most U.S. LIBOR values would cease being computed and announced from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023. Such announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed, and the timing of such discontinuation, modifications or other reforms to LIBOR is uncertain. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on the Company. However, as LIBOR is expected to cease to exist in a future period, the Company\u2019s borrowing costs may be adversely affected.\nDisruption and turmoil in global credit and financial markets, which may be exacerbated by the inability of certain countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations, and the possible unfavorable implications of such events for the global economy, may unfavorably impact our business, liquidity, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe current economic conditions, including volatility in the availability of credit and foreign exchange rates and extended economic slowdowns, have contributed to the instability in some global credit and financial markets. Additionally, at-risk financial institutions in certain countries may, without forewarning, seize a portion of depositors' account balances. The seized funds would be used to recapitalize the at-risk financial institution and would no longer be available for the depositors' use. If such seizure were to occur at financial institutions where we have funds on deposit, it could have a significant impact on our overall liquidity. While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it is possible that such events may have an unfavorable impact on the global economy and our business, liquidity, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have pension benefit obligations, which could have a material impact on our earnings, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.\nWe sponsor both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans for our international employees, primarily in Germany, France, Indonesia, India, and Italy. Our general funding policy for these qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards of the respective countries for each plan.\nThe determination of pension plan expense, benefit obligation, and future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate pension plan expense, benefit obligation, and future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in tax laws, valuation allowances, and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves may be established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve positions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as valuation allowances when we determine it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset cannot be realized. In addition, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate and profitability. We regularly assess these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidance under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiatives aim to minimize perceived tax abuses and modernize global tax policy. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (ATAD), issued by the Council of the European Union, provides further recommendations for legislative changes under these tax policies. Additional recommendations will be forthcoming. More countries are beginning to implement legislative changes based on these BEPS recommendations and ATAD measures. The OECD has also proceeded with the advancement under Action 1 (\"Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy\") of the \u2018BEPS 2.0 initiative\u2019, which proposes further fundamental changes to the international tax system. This project includes a framework for providing taxing rights to jurisdictions based on the location of the consumer regardless of current physical presence of a company. There is also a second component that would implement a global minimum tax. While there is significant uncertainty around this proposal, including how it would be applied, if implemented, it could create an adverse effect on our tax position.\nA significant number of our products are affected by the availability and regulation of radio spectrum and could be affected by interference with the radio spectrum that we use.\nA significant number of our products use radio spectrum, which are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC may adopt changes to the rules for our licensed and unlicensed frequency bands that are incompatible with our business. In the past, the FCC has adopted changes to the requirements for equipment using radio spectrum, and it is possible that the FCC or the U.S. Congress will adopt additional changes.\nAlthough radio licenses are generally required for radio stations, Part 15 of the FCC's rules permits certain low-power radio devices (Part 15 devices) to operate on an unlicensed basis. Part 15 devices are designed for use on frequencies used by others. These other users may include licensed users, which have priority over Part 15 users. Part 15 devices cannot cause harmful interference to licensed users and must be designed to accept interference from licensed radio devices. In the United States, our smart metering solutions are typically Part 15 devices that transmit information to (and receive information from, if applicable) handheld, mobile, or fixed network systems pursuant to these rules.\nWe depend upon sufficient radio spectrum to be allocated by the FCC for our intended uses. As to the licensed frequencies, there is some risk that there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain our planned operations. The unlicensed frequencies are available for a wide variety of uses and may not be entitled to protection from interference by other users who operate in accordance with FCC rules. The unlicensed frequencies are also often the subject of proposals to the FCC requesting a change in the rules under which such frequencies may be used. If the unlicensed frequencies become crowded to unacceptable levels, restrictive, or subject to changed rules governing their use, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have committed, and will continue to commit, significant resources to the development of products that use particular radio frequencies. Action by the FCC could require modifications to our products. The inability to modify our products to meet such requirements, the possible delays in completing such modifications, and the cost of such modifications all could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOutside of the United States, certain of our products require the use of RF and are subject to regulations in those jurisdictions where we have deployed such equipment. In some jurisdictions, radio station licensees are generally required to operate a radio transmitter, and such licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed. In other jurisdictions, the rules permit certain low power devices to operate on an unlicensed basis. Our smart metering solutions typically transmit to (and receive information from, if applicable) handheld, mobile, or fixed network reading devices in license-exempt bands pursuant to rules regulating such use. In Europe, we generally use the 169 megahertz (MHz), 433/4 MHz, and 868 MHz bands. In the rest of the world, we primarily use the 433/4 MHz, 920 MHz and 2.4000-2.4835 gigahertz (GHz) bands, as well as other local license-exempt bands. To the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the United States or another country into a new market, such products may require significant modification or redesign to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications. In some countries, limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those jurisdictions. In addition, new consumer products may create interference with the performance of our products, which could lead to claims against us.\nChanges in environmental regulations, violations of such regulations, or future environmental liabilities could cause us to incur significant costs and could adversely affect our operations.\nOur business and our facilities are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and ordinances governing, among other things, the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, disposal, remediation of and exposure to toxic or other hazardous substances, and certain waste products. Many of these environmental laws and regulations subject current or previous owners or operators of land to liability for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous materials. In addition, these laws and regulations typically impose liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials and regardless of whether the actions that led to the presence were conducted in compliance with the law. In the ordinary course of our business, we use metals, solvents, and similar materials, which are stored on-site. The waste created by the use of these materials is transported off-site on a regular basis by unaffiliated waste haulers. Many environmental laws and regulations require generators of waste to take remedial actions at, or in relation to, the off-site disposal location even if the disposal was conducted in compliance with the law. The requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. Failure to comply with current or future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our production processes, cessation of operations, or other actions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that a claim, investigation, or liability would not arise\nwith respect to these activities or that the cost of complying with governmental regulations in the future, either for an individual claim or in aggregate of multiple claims, would not have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to complex laws relating to foreign corrupt practices and anti-bribery laws, among many others, and a violation of, or change in, these laws could adversely affect our operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act requires U.S. companies to comply with an extensive legal framework to prevent bribery of foreign officials. The laws are complex and require that we closely monitor local practices of our overseas offices. The U.S. Department of Justice continues to heighten enforcement of these laws. In addition, other countries continue to implement similar laws that may have extra-territorial effect. In the United Kingdom, where we have operations, the U.K. Bribery Act imposes significant oversight obligations on us and could impact our operations outside the United Kingdom. The costs for complying with these and similar laws may be significant and could require significant management time and focus. Any violation of these or similar laws, intentional or unintentional, could result in fines and/or criminal penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws. We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners, or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations.\nRegulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation, and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nThe SEC has adopted rules regarding disclosure for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as \"conflict minerals\", regardless of their actual country of origin) in their products. Some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices, including our products. These requirements require companies to investigate, disclose and report whether such metals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries and required due diligence efforts. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products, and our reputation may suffer if we determine that our products contain conflict minerals that are not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products. At times, our customers also request or require that we confirm whether our products contain conflict-free minerals, and this may result in challenges in timely satisfying such customers' requests, if at all. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and related components and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Further interpretation and implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.", "PERMNO": 79839, "SIC": 3824, "TIC": "ITRI"}
