RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties. In addition to the information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings that we make with the SEC, you should carefully read and consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business, operating results, EPS financial position, cash flows and/or the trading price of our common stock (individually and collectively referred to as our \u201cfinancial performance\u201d). In addition, our actual financial performance could vary materially from any results expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained in this report, in any of our other filings with the SEC and other communications by us, both written and oral, depending on a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below. It is not possible for us to predict all possible risks or the impact these factors could have on us or the extent to which any one factor, or combination of factors, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance\nThe impact global and domestic economic conditions have on consumer discretionary spending could negatively impact our business and financial performance.\nDining out is a discretionary expenditure that historically has been influenced by domestic and global economic conditions. These conditions include, but may not be limited to: unemployment, general and food-specific inflation, consumer confidence, consumer purchasing and saving habits, credit conditions, stock market performance, home values, population growth, wage rates and individual income and payroll tax policy. Material changes to governmental policy related to domestic and international fiscal concerns, and/or changes in central bank policies with respect to monetary policy, also could affect consumer discretionary spending. Any factor affecting consumer discretionary spending may influence customer traffic in our restaurants and average check, thus potentially having a material impact on our financial performance. General economic conditions are broadly expected to continue steady, including slow GDP and wage growth, similar to the growth experienced in recent years; however, recent fiscal proposals and regulatory and policy changes could cause economic conditions to differ from recent years and/or the existing forecasts. Also, while we anticipate changes to U.S. federal tax law resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, to have a generally favorable impact on our net income margin, the effect of these changes on the macro-economy over time is difficult to forecast. If these changes cause higher inflation, higher interest rates or impact the economy in other unforeseen ways, our financial performance could suffer. Additionally, interest rates are widely expected to continue to increase in the United States going forward. These potential changes to the recent fiscal and monetary trends could alter consumer behavior, which in turn could materially affect customer traffic and spending in our restaurants and overall financial performance.\nOur financial performance may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to grow comparable restaurant sales.\nChanges in comparable restaurant sales occur due to variations in customer traffic and in average check. Customer traffic and average check may be impacted by menu price increases or decreases and/or changes in menu mix. Our strategy is to increase comparable restaurant sales by stabilizing customer traffic and growing average check. If we fail to achieve comparable restaurant sales growth or incur a decrease, and our costs also increase, remain flat, or decrease but by less than the decrease in comparable restaurant sales, the effect, over time, would be to spread costs across a lower level of sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in customer traffic are impacted by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending, perception of our concepts\u2019 offerings in terms of quality, price, value and service, changes in consumer eating habits, irregular and increasingly volatile weather conditions, demographic, economic and other adverse changes in the trade areas in which our restaurants are located and changes in the regulatory environment.\nWe compete directly and indirectly for customer traffic with national and regional casual dining restaurant chains, as well as independently-owned restaurants. The casual dining segment has been experiencing traffic declines, resulting in a more difficult environment in which to stabilize customer traffic. In addition, we face competition from quick-service restaurants, home delivery services, mobile food service, grocery stores and meal kits that are increasing their quality and variety of food products in response to consumer demand. We believe that many consumers remain focused on value, and if other restaurant operators are able to promote and deliver a higher degree of perceived value through heavy discounting or other methods, our customer traffic may be negatively impacted. Some of these competitors have significantly greater resources to market aggressively to customers, which could result in decreased market share. Our financial performance could be materially adversely affected if we are not successful in stabilizing current levels of customer traffic.\nWe utilize menu price increases to help offset inflation of key operating costs. However, our menu price increases may be insufficient to entirely absorb or offset increased costs and, if not accepted by customers, menu price increases could result in reduced customer traffic, which could negatively impact our ability to grow comparable restaurant sales and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur menu mix could be materially adversely affected if our customers purchase fewer menu items or lower cost menu items in order to reduce their check spend. Unfavorable menu mix shifts could reduce average check, negatively impacting our ability to grow comparable restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to protect the value of our brands and our reputation, sales at our restaurants may be negatively impacted, which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur reputation for quality and breadth of menu items and bakery products significantly contributes to the total experience that customers enjoy in our restaurants. We must protect and grow the value of our brands domestically and globally to continue to be successful in the future.\nIf we experience negative publicity, regardless of any factual basis, relating to food quality, restaurant facilities, customer complaints or litigation, alleging injury or food-borne illnesses, food tampering or contamination or poor health inspection scores, sanitary or other issues with respect to food processing by us or our suppliers, the condition of our restaurants, labor relations, any failure to comply with applicable regulations or standards, allegations of harassment or other negative publicity, then sales at our restaurants may be adversely impacted, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The widespread use of social media can increase the scope and speed of dissemination of adverse content, whether accurate or not, and hamper our ability to promptly correct misrepresentations or otherwise respond effectively to negative publicity, which could harm the value of our brand and materially adversely affect our financial performance. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cAny inability to effectively use and manage social media, and to respond to negative social media, could harm our marketing efforts as well as our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our restaurant sales and financial performance.\u201d)\nOur inability to anticipate and react effectively to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food, utilities, and other supplies and services, may increase our cost of doing business, which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for some of our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, such as cream cheese, depending on market conditions and expected demand. We strategically enter into long-term fixed pricing agreements for certain dairy items when available and pricing conditions are favorable, and we continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into similar arrangements for additional commodities. We also periodically evaluate hedging vehicles, such as direct financial instruments, to assist us in managing our risk and variability in these categories. Although these vehicles and markets may be available to us, as of the end of our 2017 fiscal year, we had chosen not to enter into such contracts due to pricing volatility, excessive risk premiums, hedge inefficiencies or other factors. Where we had not entered into long-term contracts, commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations, which at times may be significant. Additionally, the cost of commodities subject to governmental regulation, such as dairy and corn, can be even more susceptible to price fluctuation than other products.\nWhile we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our principal commodity, supply, service and equipment requirements, because certain of these products and services may only be available from a few vendors or service providers, we may not always be able to do so. Because of this lack of competition, we may be vulnerable to excessive price demands, especially as they relate to the cost of products or services that are critical to our profitability. Our financial performance could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage the cost of our principal commodity, supply, service and equipment requirements.\nIn those markets that are de-regulated, we engage in a competitive bidding process for our utility requirements. If this process yields favorable bid results, we may enter into utility supply agreements for certain of our restaurants. Although such supply agreements can vary in length, historically the majority have been for one-year terms. Also, resources that we may purchase on the international market are subject to fluctuations in cost and availability, which could result from a variety of factors, including the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, tariffs and fluctuating global demand. Also, our suppliers may be impacted by increased costs to produce and transport resources that we use in our restaurants and bakeries, which could increase our cost for such commodities.\nCertain products and ingredients commonly used in food preparation have recently come under scrutiny for possibly posing social and environmental risks, such as from an animal welfare and sustainability perspective. We have identified some of these products and ingredients in our supply chain and have adopted a comprehensive Sustainable Sourcing Policy under which we commit to a buying preference in our supply by 2025, or sooner where practicable, for products and ingredients that are sustainably grown and harvested and which do not have negative social impact, and for products from animals that are humanely raised and processed (\u201csustainable products\u201d). While we are committed to implementing these changes in as timely and commercially feasible manner as possible, there is a risk that some of our products or ingredients may become the subject of adverse media attention before we are able to do so. Additionally, while we make significant efforts to ensure we will have a sufficient ongoing supply of sustainable products at a reasonable cost, since there is currently a smaller market for certain of these products, they may be especially susceptible to cost volatility and supply fluctuations. We cannot be certain that our supply and cost mitigation efforts or commitment to purchase sustainable products will be successful at all times.\nWhile we try to partially offset increases in the costs of key operating resources by gradually raising prices for our menu items and bakery products, and employing more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. (See Risk Factor - \u201cOur financial performance may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to grow comparable restaurant sales.\u201d) Our financial performance could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate and effectively respond to increases in our operating costs.\nWe are experiencing significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, we will experience an increase in our cost of doing business, which will materially adversely impact our financial performance.\nIncreases in minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affecting labor costs, and a diminishing pool of potential staff members as the unemployment rate continues to fall and legal immigration is restricted, especially in certain localities, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We operate in many jurisdictions where the minimum wage and other benefits are significantly higher than the United States federal requirements, and in such areas our staff members receive minimum compensation equal to the jurisdiction\u2019s minimum requirements. In other geographic areas, some of our staff members may be paid a tip credit wage that is supplemented by gratuities received from our customers. Many jurisdictions significantly increased their minimum wage, tip credit wage and other benefits, while others and the United States federal government also are contemplating similar increases over time. In addition to increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages and other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ a large workforce, minimum wage and tip credit wage increases, as well as increases in other benefits, have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs. Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by such wage and benefit inflation, and many have or will increase our cost for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs. We expect these trends will continue as minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages continue to rise and other benefits, such as increasing leave policies, are mandated.\nOur labor expenses include a significant amount of costs related to our self-insured health and dental benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficult to project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, may cause health care costs to vary substantially from quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. We mitigate these costs by carrying stop loss coverage. We also offer a variety of health plans to our staff members, including lower cost high deductible health plans, with an option for participants to contribute to a personal health savings account (\u201cHSA\u201d), to help mitigate these costs. However, given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nA great deal of uncertainty exists with respect to the future of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (\u201cPPACA\u201d) and such uncertainty makes planning difficult year over year. Any significant changes to the healthcare insurance system, including a dismantling of PPACA in whole or in part and/or implementation of a supplementary and/or replacement healthcare insurance system, could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWhile we try to offset increases in the cost of labor by gradually raising prices for our menu items and bakery products, and employing more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cOur financial performance may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to grow comparable restaurant sales.\u201d) If we are unable to anticipate and respond to increases in our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to secure an adequate number of high quality sites for future restaurant openings, the growth of our concepts may be adversely impacted, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends on the availability and selection of high quality sites that meet our criteria. The number and timing of new restaurants opened during any given period, and their associated contribution to financial growth for the period, will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 unforeseen delays due to market conditions;\n\u00b7 the identification and availability of high quality locations;\n\u00b7 an increase in competition for available premier locations;\n\u00b7 the influence of consumer shopping trends on the availability of sites in traditional locations, such as premier shopping centers;\n\u00b7 acceptable lease terms and the lease negotiation process;\n\u00b7 the availability of suitable financing for our landlords;\n\u00b7 the financial viability of our landlords;\n\u00b7 timing of the delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to perform build-out construction activities;\n\u00b7 the ability of our landlords and us to obtain all necessary governmental licenses and permits, and consents of third parties, on a timely basis to construct and operate our restaurants;\n\u00b7 our ability to successfully manage the complex design, construction and preopening processes for our highly customized restaurants;\n\u00b7 the availability and/or cost of raw materials and labor used in construction;\n\u00b7 the availability of qualified tradespeople in the local market;\n\u00b7 any unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises;\n\u00b7 adverse weather or other delays during the construction period; and\n\u00b7 political uncertainty.\nOur inability to obtain an adequate number of suitable sites for future restaurant openings could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may incur additional costs if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases on similar terms and conditions, or at all, or to relocate our restaurants in certain trade areas, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe currently lease all of our restaurant premises and, although we remain flexible to other arrangements, we currently plan to continue to lease our restaurant locations in the future. Some of our leases have terms that will expire in the next few years and beyond. While many of these leases include renewal options, some do not. While lease expirations allow us to opportunistically evaluate the possibility of relocating certain restaurants to higher quality sites and trade areas over time, doing so may involve additional costs, such as increased rent and other expenses related to renegotiating the terms of occupancy of an existing lease, and the costs to relocate and develop a replacement restaurant if we choose not to renew a lease, or are unable to do so, on favorable terms in a desirable location. In addition, we may elect to terminate certain leases prior to their expiration dates in order to improve financial performance in certain trade areas over the long term. However, we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for such early terminations. Additional costs related to expiring restaurant lease terms, our inability to terminate certain restaurant leases under favorable terms, or the unavailability of suitable replacement locations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance could be materially adversely affected if we fail to retain, or effectively respond to a loss of, key executives.\nThe success of our business continues to depend in critical respects on the contributions of David Overton, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior executives of the Company. The departure of Mr. Overton or other senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and long-term strategic plan. We have a succession plan that includes short-term and long-term planning elements intended to allow us to successfully continue operations should any of our senior management become unavailable to serve in their respective roles. However, there is a risk that we may not be able to implement the succession plan successfully or in a timely manner or that the succession plan will not result in the same financial performance we currently achieve under the guidance of our existing executive team.\nIf we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, including executing on our plans for domestic and international expansion, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe must continue to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel to maintain consistency in the quality of our restaurants, both domestically and internationally. Qualified management and operating personnel are currently in high demand. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, and our ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively could be limited. In addition, we continue to require the services of our senior management and operating personnel to support our international expansion efforts. If we are unable to recruit and train managers to work at restaurants operated by our international licensees while adequately maintaining sufficient numbers of managers for our Company-owned locations, the quality of our operations may suffer, the reputation of our brand may be harmed and our ability to effectively grow our business may be hindered, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny inability to offer long-term equity incentive compensation may harm our ability to retain key staff members, which could materially adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nAs part of a competitive compensation package, we grant equity awards to key staff members, including our executives and our General Managers and Executive Kitchen Managers who run our restaurants. From time to time, we may ask our stockholders to approve additional shares in our equity compensation plan to allow us to continue to grant equity awards as part of our compensation packages. Stockholder advisory groups utilize guidelines to issue voting recommendations intended to influence stockholder votes regarding approval of proxy proposals. If we are unable to meet the formulae required to obtain favorable recommendations or otherwise are unable to receive stockholder support for our share increase proposals, our ability to use equity compensation to incentivize our staff will be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated our ability to deduct certain performance-based compensation, prompting us to re-examine the structure of our current performance-based compensation plan. If we are unable to grant equity compensation awards at a competitive level, we would need to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, including long-term cash compensation plans, or to significantly increase short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain key personnel. If we are required to use these alternatives, our compensation costs could increase significantly, which would materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny inability to effectively use and manage social media, and to respond to negative social media, could harm our marketing efforts as well as our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our restaurant sales and financial performance.\nSocial media provides a powerful medium for consumers, staff members and others to communicate their approval of or displeasure with a business. This aspect of social media is especially challenging because it allows any individual to reach a broad audience with an ability to respond or react, in near real time, with comments that are often not filtered or checked for accuracy. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond, any negative publicity could \u201cgo viral\u201d causing nearly immediate and potentially significant harm to our brand and reputation, whether or not factually accurate.\nOur marketing strategy includes an emphasis on social media. As social media continues to grow in popularity, many of our competitors have expanded and improved their use of social media, making it more difficult for us to differentiate our social media messaging. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal.\nIf we do not appropriately use and manage our social media strategies, our marketing efforts in this area may not be successful, and any failure (or perceived failure) to effectively respond to negative or potentially damaging social media, whether accurate or not, could damage our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our restaurant sales and financial performance.\nConcerns relating to food safety, food-borne illness, pandemics and other diseases could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe face food safety risks, including the risk of food-borne illness and food contamination (including allergen cross contamination), which are common both in the restaurant industry and the food supply chain. While we dedicate substantial resources and provide training to ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve, these risks cannot be completely eliminated. Additionally, we rely on our network of suppliers to properly handle, store and transport our ingredients for delivery to our restaurants. Any failure by our suppliers, or their suppliers, could cause our ingredients to be contaminated, which could be difficult to detect and put the safety of our food in jeopardy. We freshly prepare our menu items at our restaurants, which may put us at greater risk for food-borne illness and food contamination outbreaks than some of our competitors who use processed foods or commissaries to prepare their food. The risk of food-borne illness also may increase whenever our menu items are served outside of our control, such as by third-party food delivery services, customer take out or at catered events.\nAdverse publicity or news reports, regardless of accuracy, regarding food quality or safety issues, illness, injury, recalls, health concerns, government or industry findings concerning food products served by us or our licensees, or issues stemming from the operation of our restaurants or bakeries, restaurants operated by our licensees, third parties with whom we may co-brand products or who sell or distribute our products, or third parties we may use to procure materials used in our business, or generally in the food supply chain, could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our brand and reputation, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf a pathogen, such as Ebola, \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d \u201cSARS,\u201d \u201cswine flu,\u201d avian influenza, norovirus or other virus or bacteria, such as salmonella or E.coli, or if parasites or other toxins infect the food supply (or are believed to have infected the food supply), the demand, availability and price of certain food items may be adversely impacted. Additionally, if our customers or staff members become infected with a pathogen which was actually or claimed to be contracted at our restaurants, customers may avoid our restaurants or it may become difficult to adequately staff our restaurants, the occurrence of either or both of which may materially adversely affect our financial performance. Any adverse food safety occurrence may result in litigation against us by customers, governmental authorities and others. Although we carry liability and other insurance coverage to mitigate against these risks, not all risks of this nature are fully insurable and, even if insured, the negative publicity associated with such an event may cause a decrease in customer patronage which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn addition to selling products throughout the world through various distribution channels, including, without limitation, supermarkets, mass market retailers, club stores and various other food service and retail channels, our two bakery facilities are the only sources of most of our baked desserts to our restaurants. If any of our bakery products becomes subject to a product recall or market withdrawal, whether voluntary or involuntary, our costs to conduct such recall or market withdrawal could be significant, restaurant sales as well as third-party sales of bakery product may be reduced and our reputation could be harmed, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn addition, any adverse food safety event could result in mandatory or voluntary product withdrawals or recalls, regulatory and other investigations, and/or criminal fines and penalties, any of which could disrupt our operations, increase our costs, require us to respond to findings from regulatory agencies that may divert resources and assets, and result in potential civil fines and penalties as well as other legal action, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and subject us to increased operating costs, as well as to litigation and other liabilities, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely heavily on our in-restaurant and enterprise-wide computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations (\u201cCyber Environment\u201d), which could be vulnerable to various risks. The efficient management of our operations depends upon our ability to protect our Cyber Environment against damage from physical theft, casualties such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms, malware, breaches of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect data, including customer transaction and credit card data, and other disruptive problems caused by hackers or others who intentionally target Cyber Environment vulnerabilities of companies such as ours (collectively, \u201csecurity incidents\u201d). We employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our Cyber Environment to reduce the likelihood of any security incident. In addition, we developed a multi-discipline security incident response plan to help ensure that our executives are fully and accurately informed and manage, with the help of content experts, the discovery, investigation and auditing of, and recovery from any security incidents. However, we can provide no assurance that these measures will be successful in preventing losses in the event of a security incident.\nAlso, our international licensees have access to certain elements of our intellectual property within their Cyber Environment and may not have developed processes to secure their systems and equipment against a security incident or maintain discovery, investigation, auditing and recovery protocols that are as robust as our own, or have the ability to respond to a security incident to the same extent and as timely. Available cyber-risk insurance coverage and policy limits may not adequately cover or compensate us in the event of a security incident. Our financial performance may be materially adversely affected if our operations are interrupted by a security incident from which we are not able to promptly and fully recover, if any cyber-risk insurance is unable to fully address our losses, and/or if we become subjected to litigation or regulatory action because of such an incident.\nOur inability to maintain a secure environment for customers\u2019 and staff members\u2019 personal data could harm our reputation and result in litigation against us, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and staff members. For example, we transmit confidential credit card information in connection with credit card transactions, and we are required to collect and maintain certain personal information in connection with our employment practices, including the administration of our benefit plans. Our collection and use of this information may be regulated by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations. If a security incident occurs involving loss or inappropriate access to or dissemination of such personal information, we may become liable under applicable law for damages (including statutory damages) and incur penalties and other costs to remedy such incident. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such an incident, these damages, penalties and costs could be significant and could exceed applicable coverage limits under available insurance policies, if any. Such an event also could harm our reputation and result in litigation against us. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to accept credit cards as payment in our restaurants and for online gift card orders depends on us remaining compliant with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI). These standards require certain levels of Cyber Environment security and procedures to protect our customers\u2019 credit card and other personal information. We continue to evaluate additional security enhancements and have implemented end-to-end encryption and tokenization technology, PKI that only permits known computing assets access to our network, and Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention (IDS/IPS) that scans data in transit detecting and preventing the execution of harmful code. However, we can provide no assurance that our security measures will be successful in the event of an attempted or actual security incident. If these security measures are not successful, we may become subject to litigation or the imposition of regulatory penalties, which could result in negative publicity and significantly harm our reputation, either of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could limit our ability to globally expand our brand, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe own and have applied to register trade names, logos, service marks, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property (collectively, \u201cIntellectual Property\u201d), including The Cheesecake Factory\u00ae, The Cheesecake Factory Bakery\u00ae, The Cheesecake Factory At Home\u2122, Grand Lux Cafe\u00ae, Rock Sugar Pan Asian Kitchen\u00ae, and RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen\u00ae in the United States and in additional countries throughout the world. Our Intellectual Property is valuable to our business and requires continuous monitoring to protect. We protect our Intellectual Property in a variety of ways, including by contract and by registration in the United States and in various other countries throughout the world. We regularly and systemically search for misappropriations of our Intellectual Property and seek to enforce our rights whenever appropriate to do so; however, we cannot be assured of success in every case and cannot possibly find all infringing uses of our Intellectual Property. Furthermore, we have not registered all of our Intellectual Property throughout the world, as doing so may not be feasible because of associated costs, various foreign trademark law prohibitions or registrations by others. Our inability to effectively protect our Intellectual Property domestically or internationally could limit our ability to globally expand our brand thereby materially adversely affecting our financial performance.\nWe face a variety of risks related to our international expansion and global brand development efforts that could negatively affect our brand, require additional infrastructure to support such efforts, and expose us to additional liabilities under foreign laws, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nInternational operations have a unique set of risks that differ from country to country, and can include, among other risks, political instability, governmental corruption, social, religious and ethnic unrest, anti-American sentiment, delayed and potentially less effective ability to respond to a crisis occurring internationally, changes in global economic conditions (such as currency valuation, disposable income, climate change, unemployment levels and increases in the prices of commodities and labor), the regulatory environment, immigration, labor and pension laws, income and other taxes, consumer preferences and practices, as well as changes in the laws and regulations governing foreign investment, joint ventures or licensing arrangements in countries where our restaurants or licensees are located, the financial stability and wherewithal of our licensees, and local import controls.\nThe products and services offered at our international Company-owned and licensed restaurants may be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 difficulties in achieving the consistency of product quality and service as compared to restaurants we operate in the United States;\n\u00b7 changes to our recipes required by cultural norms;\n\u00b7 inability to obtain, at a reasonable cost, adequate and reliable supplies of ingredients and products necessary to execute our diverse menu;\n\u00b7 availability of experienced management to operate international restaurants according to our domestic standards;\n\u00b7 changes in economic conditions of our licensees, whether or not related to the operation of our restaurants;\n\u00b7 differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, immigration, social, climatic, and political conditions, including the possibility of terrorism, social unrest, trade embargos and/or trade restrictions, which may delay our international expansion, result in periodic or permanent closure of foreign restaurants, affect our ability to supply our international restaurants with necessary supplies and ingredients and affect international perception of our brand;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7 currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, taxes or tariffs adversely affecting our or our licensees\u2019 ability to import goods from the United States and other parts of the world that are required for operating our branded restaurants, including our cakes which are wholly manufactured in the United States.\nOur international licensees are authorized to operate The Cheesecake Factory\u00ae restaurant concept using certain of our intellectual property and systems, and to provide our branded food and bakery products directly to customers in The Cheesecake Factory restaurants opened in the licensed trade areas. We provide extensive and detailed training to our licensees so their staff members may be able to effectively execute our operating processes and procedures and periodically audit their performance and adherence to our requirements. However, since we do not operate these restaurants directly, we can provide no assurance that our licensees will adhere to our operating standards in the same manner as we would were such restaurants operated directly by us.\nIf we or our licensees have difficulty operating our international restaurants effectively, or if we or they fail to receive an adequate return on investment, and these difficulties are attributed to us or our brand, our reputation and brand value could be harmed, our revenues from these restaurants could be diminished, and our international growth may be slowed, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn order to support our international expansion, our bakeries supply certain of our bakery products to our branded international restaurants. In order to supply bakery products to these restaurants, we must adapt certain recipes to eliminate locally prohibited ingredients, comply with labeling requirements that differ from those in the United States, and maintain certifications required to export to such countries. In addition, unexpected events outside of our control, such as trade restrictions, import and export embargos, governmental shutdowns and disruptions in shipping, may affect our ability to transport adequate levels of our bakery products to our international restaurants, for which we are the sole source of supply. A failure to adequately supply bakery products to our internationally branded restaurants could affect the customer experience at those restaurants, resulting in decreased sales, and could, depending upon the reason for the failure, trigger contractual defaults on our part, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs we continue the international expansion of our brand, we must comply with regulations and legal requirements, including those related to immigration and the protection of our Intellectual Property. Additionally, we must comply with domestic laws affecting U.S. businesses that operate internationally, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-boycott laws, and with foreign laws in the countries in which we expand our restaurants. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors -\u201cChanges in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\u201d) Our financial performance may also be materially adversely affected by liabilities, costs and expenses we may incur in the event we become subject to lawsuits or other legal actions resulting from our acts or omissions or those of our licensees. There can be no assurance that any insurance coverage or contractual indemnification would be effective to protect against such liabilities.\nOur strategic relationship with Fox Restaurant Concepts LLC (\u201cFRC\u201d) might not yield the anticipated benefits, and we may lose some or all of our investment, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we entered into a strategic relationship with FRC with respect to two of its brands, North Italia and Flower Child. Under the terms of the agreements, we made initial minority equity investments in, and have and will continue to provide ongoing growth capital for, these concepts. We have the right, and an obligation if certain financial, legal and operational conditions are met, to acquire the remaining interest in either or both of these concepts in the next two to four years.\nInherent in our investment is a risk that either or both concepts will not be successful or will fail to grow as quickly as we projected. In any such event, we may not realize return on investment at least equal to that which we would have realized through other opportunities and risk losing some or all of our investment. While we do not anticipate that we will need to incur debt to fund our ongoing growth capital commitments during the investment period, we might incur indebtedness should we ultimately acquire one or both concepts. If we incur debt, depending on the level of our indebtedness, we could experience important consequences to our business, such as reduced flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increased borrowing costs. There can be no assurance that we will acquire either majority or full ownership of either concept. If we do eventually acquire either or both concepts, we may be unable to successfully integrate the business(es) into our operations, and there can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits we anticipate in connection with such an acquisition. If we lose some or all of our investment in one or both of these concepts, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are selectively pursuing and continue to evaluate developing, investing in or acquiring new restaurant concepts, expansion of The Cheesecake Factory At HomeTM brand to other retail opportunities and other initiatives which may create risks to our business that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are selectively pursuing and continue to evaluate other means to leverage our competitive strengths, including developing, investing in or acquiring new restaurant concepts, expansion of our brands to other retail opportunities and/or other initiatives. Any involvement in any such development, investment arrangement, acquisition, expansion of our brand or other initiative, may create inherent risks, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 damaging our reputation if retail products bearing our brand are not of the same value and quality that our customers associate with our brand;\n\u00b7 dilution of the goodwill associated with our brand as it becomes more common and increasingly accessible;\n\u00b7 inaccurate assessment of value, growth potential, weaknesses, liabilities, contingent or otherwise, and expected profitability of such ventures;\n\u00b7 inability to achieve any anticipated operating synergies or economies of scale;\n\u00b7 potential loss of key personnel of any acquired business;\n\u00b7 challenges in successfully integrating, operating and managing an acquired business or venture and its workforce and instilling our company culture in new management and staff;\n\u00b7 difficulties in aligning enterprise management systems, compensation and benefit plans and policies and procedures;\n\u00b7 unforeseen changes in the market and economic conditions affecting the acquired business or venture;\n\u00b7 possibility of impairment charges if an acquired business or venture does not meet the performance expectations upon which the acquisition price was based; and\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention and focus from existing operations to the integration of the acquired or merged business and its personnel or to the expansion of the brand to non-restaurant items.\nIf we do not appropriately scale our infrastructure in a timely manner we may be unable to respond to and support our domestic or international opportunities for growth, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe continually evaluate the appropriate level of infrastructure necessary to support our operational and development plans, including our domestic and international expansion. If market conditions improve and we are able to identify enough high quality sites to significantly increase the planned number of new restaurant openings in the future, we may be unable to scale or manage the growth of our corporate and field supervision infrastructure in the short term to appropriately support our expansion. Likewise, if sales decline, we may be unable to reduce our infrastructure quickly enough to prevent sales deleverage which would materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur international license agreements require us to provide training and support to our licensees for their development and operation of The Cheesecake Factory restaurants. We have dedicated certain corporate personnel to international development and continue to utilize the talents of existing management, as we grow our international licensing and operations infrastructure. In addition, one of the most important aspects of our restaurant operations is our ability to deliver dependable, quality service by experienced staff members who can execute our concepts according to our high standards. This may require training our licensees\u2019 management in the United States and our licensees\u2019 staff members in the licensed territories, as well as providing support in the selection and development of restaurant sites, product sourcing logistics, technological systems, and menu modification. If we are unable to provide the appropriate level of infrastructure support to our international licensees, including due to a lack of available personnel or due to foreign or domestic governmental restrictions on travel or on the ability of our staff members to provide training in licensed countries or our licensees\u2019 staff members to receive training domestically, or due to self-imposed restrictions on travel of our staff members as a result of terrorism or other political unrest in areas in which our licensees operate, our contractual relationships and future international expansion opportunities may be harmed resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur failure or inability to develop and grow other branded concepts could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to develop and grow other branded concepts is becoming increasingly important to our long-term growth potential. We have developed and currently operate restaurants under the Grand Lux Cafe\u00ae and RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen\u00ae (transitioning from Rock Sugar Pan Asian Kitchen\u00ae) brands and are in the process of developing a new fast casual concept and expanding The Cheesecake Factory At HomeTM brand to other retail opportunities. While all of our restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this filing , there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to our ability to develop and grow our less established concepts. We can provide no assurance that our new and/or less established concepts will be accepted in the markets targeted for expansion or that we will be able to achieve our targeted returns. Our failure or inability to develop and grow other branded concepts could detrimentally affect our long-term growth potential, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are required to comply with various federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to alcoholic beverage control, public health and safety, access and use by the disabled, environmental hazards, labor and employment laws, including, without limitation, equal wage laws and exempt versus non-exempt employee classifications, data security and food safety and labeling. Changes to these laws and regulations may create challenges for us, and while we subscribe to certain services and have established procedures to identify changes in the laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will identify every change and comply therewith on a timely basis. We may incur penalties and other costs, sanctions and adverse publicity by failing to comply with applicable laws, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe failure to obtain and/or retain licenses, permits or other regulatory approvals required to operate our business could delay or prevent the opening and/or continued operation of a restaurant or our bakeries, materially adversely affecting that facility\u2019s operations and profitability and our ability to obtain similar licenses, permits or approvals elsewhere. In addition, the failure to comply with governmental regulations could subject us to penalties and interruptions in operations. In certain jurisdictions, we may be subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes that generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Dram shop litigation may result in significant judgments, including punitive damages. A settlement or judgment against us under a dram shop statute in excess of our general liability insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nSignificant increases in minimum wages, including the tip credit wage in certain states, paid or unpaid leaves of absence, equal wage legislation, mandatory sick pay and paid time off regulations in a growing number of jurisdictions, mandated health and/or COBRA benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to our staff members who receive gratuities, or changes in interpretations of existing employment law, including with respect to classification of exempt versus non-exempt employees, could significantly increase our labor costs, which would materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination in the workplace and that set standards for the design, accessibility and operation of public facilities, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and failure to comply could create exposure to government proceedings and litigation. Even a perceived failure to comply could result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, various federal, state and local and foreign labor laws and regulations govern our operations and relationships with our staff members, including, but not limited to, minimum wages, breaks, overtime, deductions, certain benefits (including health care benefits), safety, working conditions and citizenship and legal residency requirements. These requirements also extend to independent third-party service providers we engage to perform certain services at our restaurants. While we take precautions to ensure that our third-party service providers comply with applicable laws and to maintain an independent contractor relationship, we cannot be assured such efforts will be successful, and we may incur liability vicariously as a joint employer for failures by our independent third-party service providers to comply with applicable laws. Changes in, or any failure to comply with, these laws and regulations could subject us to fines or other legal actions. Settlements or judgments in connection therewith that are not insured against or are in excess of our coverage limitations could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nDespite our efforts to maintain compliance with legal requirements, including implementation of electronic verification of legal work status, some of our staff members may not meet legal citizenship or residency requirements. This could result in a disruption in our work force, sanctions against us and adverse publicity. In addition, immigration-related employment regulations may make it more difficult for us to identify and hire qualified staff members. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors -\u201cWe face a variety of risks related to our international expansion and global brand development efforts that could negatively affect our brand, require additional infrastructure to support such efforts, and expose us to additional liabilities under foreign laws, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance\u201d for a discussion of regulatory risks related to our international expansion.)\nChanges in tax laws and resulting regulations could result in changes to our tax provisions and expose us to additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial performance\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, such as the December 2017 enactment of Federal legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d), or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect and changes to state tax laws that may occur in response to the Tax Act, could affect our tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur inability to respond appropriately to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations could negatively impact our operations and competitive position, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nPPACA requires restaurant operators with twenty or more locations to make certain nutritional information available to customers. The nutritional disclosure requirements under PPACA are intended to preempt a patchwork of state and local laws regarding nutritional content disclosures that became prevalent over the past several years. Establishments covered by the nutritional disclosure requirements under PPACA have until May 7, 2018, to comply with the new rules. There is some uncertainty with respect to certain details of the new rules and how they will be enforced. Additionally, until the new compliance date in May 2018, many states, counties and cities will continue to enforce their own nutritional content disclosure requirements. The continued uncertainty relating to nutritional content disclosure and ongoing need to comply with a patchwork of various state and local disclosure requirements continues to be a challenge for us, raising our compliance cost and exposing us to risk of non-compliance. Also, since our menus are printed on a periodic basis, the timing of implementation of new requirements can affect our ability to timely and accurately comply with such legislation, especially if it continues to be subject to continuous changes in interpretation and delays in implementation.\nSome state, local and foreign governments also have enacted legislation regulating or prohibiting the sale of or mandating disclosures relating to certain types and/or levels of ingredients in food served in restaurants, such as trans fats, sodium, GMOs and gluten, and are taxing or considering taxing and/or otherwise regulating high fat, high sugar and high sodium foods. The success of our restaurant and bakery operations and that of our international licensees depends, in part, upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings and bakery selections to changes in governmental requirements. If consumer health regulations change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items. In addition, dietary restrictions in some international locations where our licensees plan to operate may require us to modify or discontinue serving certain menu items in those locations. Our inability to respond with appropriate changes to our bakery and menu offerings in response to regulations governing the sale or disclosure of certain ingredients could result in us being unable to sell certain bakery products or menu items in certain jurisdictions and could also lead to negative publicity about our bakery products or menu items, which, in turn, could adversely affect customer demand for our concepts and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nLabor organizing could harm our operations and competitive position in the restaurant industry, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur staff members and others may attempt to unionize our workforce, establish boycotts or picket lines or interrupt our supply chains which could limit our ability to manage our workforce effectively and cause disruptions to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our labor costs may significantly increase if we become unable to effectively manage our workforce and the compensation and benefits we offer to our staff members, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to manage our business risks, costs associated with litigation and insurance could increase, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters typically involve claims by customers, staff members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry. In states with dram shop statutes, we may become subject to dram shop litigation that could result in significant judgments, including punitive damages. We could be materially adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Employment-related litigation, particularly with respect to claims styled as class action lawsuits, are especially costly to defend. Also, some employment-related claims in the area of wage and hour disputes are not insurable risks and many employment-related disputes involve uncertainty in judicial interpretation from state to state and from federal to state court with respect to the effectiveness of arbitration agreements with our staff members, particularly those which provide for class waivers. We have experienced an increase in wage and hour litigation, in particular in California, where we have seen an increase in claims filed under California\u2019s Private Attorneys General Act (\u201cPAGA\u201d). PAGA allows an aggrieved staff member to bring a lawsuit on behalf of other current and former staff members for labor code violations, including certain technical violations. PAGA claims are not subject to arbitration and may result in exposure to additional penalties, which can be assessed separately from recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that are not insured or are in excess of insurance coverage can materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe retain the financial responsibility for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, employment practices, staff health benefits and certain other insurable risks. A number of factors may significantly increase our self-insurance costs, such as conditions of the insurance market, the availability of insurance, or changes in applicable regulations. The accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us (\u201cIBNR\u201d) as of each balance sheet date. Significant judgment is required to estimate IBNR amounts, as parties have yet to assert such claims. Our financial performance may be materially adversely affected if our actual claims costs significantly exceed our estimates.\nWe may be required to record impairment charges, be unable to fully recoup landlord improvement allowances and/or decide to discontinue operations at certain restaurants, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe assess the potential impairment of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. We regularly review restaurants that are cash flow negative for the previous four quarters and those that are being considered for closure or relocation to determine if impairment testing is warranted. (See \u201cImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Lease Terminations\u201d in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our impairment assessments.) At any given time, we may be monitoring certain locations, and future impairment charges and/or closures may occur if individual restaurant performance does not improve, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nA portion of our tenant allowances at certain premises may be subject to recoupment against percentage rent otherwise payable for such sites. When we are unable to achieve sales in a sufficient amount to generate percentage rent obligations, we are not able to fully recoup available allowances at affected sites, which also could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf any of our third-party vendors experiences a failure that affects a significant aspect of our business, we may be subject to certain risks and may experience data loss, increased costs or other harm, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn order to leverage our internal resources and information technology infrastructure, and to support our business continuity and disaster recovery planning efforts in the event of a physical loss or damage to our corporate facilities, we utilize third-party vendors to assist us with some of our essential business processes. For example, we rely on a network of third-party distribution warehouses to deliver ingredients and other materials to our restaurants. In some instances, these processes rely on technology and may be outsourced to the vendor in their entirety and in other instances we utilize these vendors\u2019 externally-hosted business applications. Some of the technological processes for which we utilize third parties include, but are not limited to, gift card tracking and authorization, labor scheduling, email hosting, website hosting, file collaboration, restaurant back office, benefits administration, mobile payment and staff recruiting.\nWe also utilize third parties to provide gift card distribution and transaction processing services and to perform food delivery services. We derive substantial revenue from these aspects of our business, which could suffer in the event of any factor that adversely impacts our vendors\u2019 ability to provide such services. Such factors may include, without limitation, loss of, or significant change in contractual terms of, key vendor contracts, vendor or processor failures, technology failures, damage to the reputation of any key vendor or other similar occurrences.\nWe continue to review options to expand the use of third-party providers in other areas. Our practice is to work with service providers that are leading performers in their industries and with technology vendors that employ up to date and appropriate data security practices and internal control practices. However, we cannot guarantee that failures will not occur. The failure of third-party vendors to provide adequate services, including protection of sensitive data, could significantly harm our operations and reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur inability or failure to execute on comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans following a major natural or manmade disaster, including terrorism, at our corporate or bakery facilities could result in delayed recovery, loss of data, an inability to perform vital corporate functions, reduced capacity to produce bakery products, and other harm, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAll of our core and critical applications are housed in an external tier III data center. To mitigate business interruptions, we employ a disk-based data backup and replication infrastructure between our onsite and external data centers so all data is replicated nightly between two sites. We provide support for our restaurant operations, with the exception of design and construction, from our corporate headquarters in Calabasas, California, an area that is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and wildfires. In addition, corporate support for our bakery operations is also at this centralized location, with the exception of our East Coast bakery production and fulfillment facility. If we are unable to execute our disaster recovery procedures in whole or in part, we may experience delays in recovery and losses of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal operating procedures that could expose us to administrative and other legal claims any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. A closure or material damage to one or both of our bakery facilities may result in an inability to fulfill or a slowdown in fulfillment of our bakery products to our own and our international licensees\u2019 restaurants as well as to other bakery customers. Such an incident could also result in the loss of critical data regarding our bakery operations. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nLost production capacity resulting from the temporary closure of our California bakery for refurbishment, renovation and retrofitting could result in a shortage of our baked dessert products that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate two bakery facilities, one located in California and the other in North Carolina, that produce desserts for our restaurants, international licensees and third-party bakery customers. We are in the process of refurbishing, renovating and retrofitting our California bakery production facility, which will require us to close the facility for a period of time and result in temporary lost production capacity. In preparation for this lost production capacity, we produced inventories of product to satisfy projected requirements while our California facility is inoperative. Our failure to plan accordingly and/or to complete the refurbishment, renovation and retrofitting of our California bakery in accordance with our projected timeline could result in a shortage of our baked dessert products. In such an event, our North Carolina bakery will likely be unable to both satisfy the requirements of our and our international licensee\u2019s restaurants and fully satisfy the demand of our third-party bakery customers. Additionally, we will lose significant potential production capacity while our California facility is inoperative, resulting in substantially greater risk to the continuity of our bakery operations in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event that impacts our North Carolina bakery. For any of these reasons, our lost production capacity resulting from the temporary closure of our California bakery for refurbishment, renovation and retrofitting could result in a shortage of our baked dessert products that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAdverse weather conditions, seasonal fluctuations, natural disasters and effects of climate change could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters can impact customer traffic at our restaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating, make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants and, in more severe cases, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, blizzards or other natural disasters, cause a temporary inability to obtain supplies, increase commodity costs and cause closures of our affected restaurants, sometimes for prolonged periods, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Seasonal fluctuations may result from the calendar days of the week on which holidays occur, which may impact consumer spending patterns. Increasing frequency and unpredictability of adverse weather conditions due to climate changes may result in decreased customer traffic, less accurate year-to-year comparisons in sales and other factors affecting financial performance. Our cash flows may be negatively impacted by delay in the receipt of proceeds under any insurance policies or programs we maintain against certain of these risks or the proceeds may not fully offset any such losses. Any or all of these situations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nActs of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terrorism, could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny act of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid visiting our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact cash flows and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nNew restaurant openings may negatively impact sales at our existing restaurants, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe opening of a new restaurant could negatively impact sales at one or more of our existing nearby restaurants, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. It is not our intention to open new restaurants that materially cannibalize the sales of our existing restaurants. However, there can be no assurance that such sales impact will not occur or become more significant in the future as we gradually increase our presence in existing markets to maximize our competitive position and financial performance in each market.\nOur failure to establish, maintain and apply adequate internal control over our financial reporting and comply with changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting - a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. If we experience a material weakness in internal controls, there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate such material weakness in a timely manner or maintain all of the controls necessary to remain in compliance. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Additionally, changes in accounting standards or new accounting pronouncements and interpretations may occur that could materially adversely affect our previously reported or future financial results, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFailure to satisfy financial covenants and/or repayment requirements under our credit facility could harm our financial condition, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe have an unsecured revolving credit facility (\u201cFacility\u201d) with an available borrowing commitment of $200 million and with a commitment increase feature that could provide for an additional $100 million in available credit, subject to the lenders\u2019 electing to increase their commitments or by means of the addition of new lenders. At January 2, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Facility and had $10 million outstanding under the Facility. However, any failure to maintain these debt covenants or have sufficient liquidity to either repay or refinance the then outstanding balance at expiration of the Facility, or upon violation of the covenants, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 for additional information concerning our long-term debt.)\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the price of our common stock fluctuated between $38.34 and $67.14 per share. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or those of our competitors as compared to analyst expectations, changes in financial estimates by research analysts with respect to us or others in the restaurant industry, and announcements of significant transactions (including mergers or acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives) by us or others in the restaurant industry. In addition, the equity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that affect the stock price of companies in ways that have been unrelated to an individual company\u2019s operating performance. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, based on factors specific to our company and industry, as well as factors related to the equity markets overall.\nWe may not be able to achieve our long-term objective of mid-teens total return to stockholders, on average.\nWe define our total returns as EPS growth plus our dividend yield. Comparable restaurant sales that are below our target, slowing growth of our concepts domestically, our inability to successfully execute other growth opportunities, a decline in growth of our international business, any event that causes our operating costs to substantially increase or an inability to repurchase our stock as expected could slow EPS growth and reduce total returns. Any of these occurrences on a multi-year basis, or a decline in our dividend yield, could bring about lower than targeted mid-teens total returns, on average, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nIf we are unable to continue to pay, or if we are unable to increase, dividends, our stock price may be harmed.\nOur ability to pay and increase our dividends over time will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and capacity to borrow funds, which may be subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our credit facility limits cash distributions with respect to our equity interests, such as cash dividends and share repurchases, based on a defined ratio. (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our long-term debt.) Any failure to pay or increase our dividends over time may negatively impact investor confidence in us, and may negatively impact our stock price.\nWe have a stockholder rights plan, which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire us.\nIn August 2008, our Board of Directors extended our stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d until August 2018. The stockholder rights plan may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, or acquiring us through an acquisition, merger or similar transaction even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price in the event of such transaction. On February 15, 2018, our Board of Directors announced that upon the expiration of our stockholder\u2019s rights plan on August 4, 2018, it is its intention not to adopt another shareholder rights plan unless, in the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, it determines that it is in the best interests of the stockholders under the circumstances to adopt such plan without the delay that would result from seeking stockholder approval, thereafter put such plan to a stockholder ratification vote within 12 months of adoption, and if such plan is not approved by a majority of the votes cast, terminate the plan.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity that may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue additional shares of common stock and additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the stockholders. The Board of Directors also has the discretion, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation or winding up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred shares that have a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of our common stockholders or the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nActions of activist investors could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock price.\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to activist investor campaigns. Responding to actions of an activist investor may be a significant distraction for our management and staff, and could require us to expend significant time and resources, including legal fees and potential proxy solicitation expenses. Any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 77902, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "CAKE"}
