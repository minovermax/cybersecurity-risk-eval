{"cik": "923139", "company": "FLUSHING FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, the following factors and other considerations should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Significantly Impacted Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, as well as our business, financial position, operations, liquidity, loans, asset quality, capital, results of operations and prospects. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and many of which are outside of our control. These future developments may include the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, the possibility of future resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued effectiveness of the Company\u2019s business continuity plan including work-from-home arrangements and staffing at branches and certain other facilities, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s customers, employees, third-party service providers, as well as on other market participants, actions taken, or that may yet be taken, by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness and public acceptance of vaccines for COVID-19.\nAlthough financial markets have largely rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions have improved, many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persist. Those circumstances include:\n\u25cf supply chain issues remain unresolved for longer than anticipated and decreased consumer and business confidence and economic activity, leading to certain lower loan demand and an increased risk of loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures;\n\u25cf ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries;\n\u25cf volatility in financial and capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates;\n\u25cf a reduction in the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer or service for others, affecting demand for our services;\n\u25cf heightened cybersecurity, information security, and operational risks as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption resulting from the pandemic given increased online and remote activity, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements;\n\u25cf disruptions to business operations experienced by counterparties and service providers;\n\u25cf increased risk of business disruption if our employees are unable to work effectively because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt work-from-home arrangements, or other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf decreased demands for our products and services.\nAs a result, our credit, operational, and certain other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic going forward, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and these or other adverse developments may occur or reoccur. Governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures both to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide economic assistance to individuals and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions governmental authorities take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, various government programs such as the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection program (\u201cPPP\u201d) are complex and our participation may lead to litigation and governmental, regulatory and third-party scrutiny, negative publicity, and damage to our reputation.\nThe length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a recession. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, loans, asset quality or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K.\n.\nChanges in Interest Rates May Significantly Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (the \u201cFOMC\u201d), and market interest rates. It is currently expected that during 2022 the FOMC will increase interest rates multiple times, commencing in March 2022. The current consensus of expectations as to the magnitude of such increases already exceeds that consensus as recently as of the end of 2021, although there can be no assurances as to any future FOMC conduct. A significant portion of our loans have fixed interest rates (or, if adjustable, are initially fixed for periods of five to 10 years) and longer terms than our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans. Our interest rate risk is exacerbated in the short term by the fact that approximately 80% of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings will reprice or mature during the next year.\nAs a result of our historical focus on the origination of multi-family residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans, the majority of our loans are adjustable rate, however, many adjust at periods of five to 10 years. In addition, a large percentage of our investment securities and mortgage-backed securities have fixed interest rates and are classified as available for sale. As is the case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time and are currently at historical low levels. As interest rates increase, our cost of funds will increase more rapidly than the yields on a substantial portion of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of our fixed-rate assets for example, our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, would decline if interest rates increase. In line with the foregoing, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to raising the rates we pay on some of our deposit products to stay competitive within our market and an increase in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate.\nPrevailing interest rates also affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans. In a declining interest rate environment, the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing may increase, as well as prepayments of mortgage-\nbacked securities. Call provisions associated with our investment in U.S. government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment. Such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage-backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment. However, we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced, which partially offset the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments. In periods of low interest rates, our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher-yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us, which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources are utilized. An increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which could adversely affect net interest income. Also, in an increasing interest rate environment, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities may prepay at slower rates than experienced in the past, which could result in a reduction of prepayment penalty income. In addition, depositors tend to open longer term, higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase or decrease at repricing dates. Significant increases in prevailing interest rates may significantly affect demand for loans and the value of bank collateral. See \u201c- Local Economic Conditions.\nOur Lending Activities Involve Risks that May Be Exacerbated Depending on the Mix of Loan Types\nAt December 31, 2021, our gross loan portfolio was $6,633.9 million, of which 78.4% was mortgage loans secured by real estate. The majority of these real estate loans were secured by multi-family residential property ($2,517.0 million), commercial real estate ($1,775.6 million) and one-to-four family mixed-use property ($571.8 million), which combined represent 73.3% of our loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area. Multi-family residential, one-to-four family mixed-use property, commercial real estate mortgage loans, commercial business loans and construction loans, are generally viewed as exposing the lender to a greater risk of loss than fully underwritten one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and typically involve higher principal amounts per loan. Multi-family residential, one-to-four family mixed-use property and commercial real estate mortgage loans are typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related property, which is usually owned by a legal entity with the property being the entity\u2019s only asset. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. If the borrower defaults, our only remedy may be to foreclose on the property, for which the market value may be less than the balance due on the related mortgage loan. We attempt to mitigate this risk by generally requiring a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 75% at a time the loan is originated, except for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, where we require a loan-to value ratio of no more than 80%. Repayment of construction loans is contingent upon the successful completion and operation of the project. The repayment of commercial business loans (the increased origination of which is part of management\u2019s strategy), is contingent on the successful operation of the related business. Changes in local economic conditions and government regulations, which are outside the control of the borrower or lender, also could affect the value of the security for the loan or the future cash flow of the affected properties. We continually review the composition of our mortgage loan portfolio to manage the risk in the portfolio.\nIn assessing our future earnings prospects, investors should consider, among other things, our level of origination of one-to-four family residential, multi-family residential, commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans, and commercial business and construction loans, and the greater risks associated with such loans. See \u201cBusiness - Lending Activities\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nFailure to Effectively Manage Our Liquidity Could Significantly Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our business. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, both retail deposits from our branch network including our Internet Branch, brokered deposits, and borrowed funds, primarily wholesale borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the \u201cFHLB-NY\u201d). Funds are also provided by the repayment and sale of securities and loans. Our ability to obtain funds are influenced by many external factors, including but not limited to, local and national economic conditions, the direction of interest rates and competition for deposits in the markets we serve. Additionally, changes in the FHLB-NY underwriting guidelines may limit or restrict our ability to borrow. A decline in available funding caused by any of the above factors could adversely impact our ability to originate\nloans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill our obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands.\nOur Ability to Obtain Brokered Deposits as an Additional Funding Source Could be Limited\nWe utilize brokered deposits as an additional funding source and to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. The Bank had $0.6 billion or 9.8% of total deposits and $1.1 billion, or 17.5% of total deposits, in brokered deposit accounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have obtained brokered certificates of deposit when the interest rate on these deposits is below the prevailing interest rate for non-brokered certificates of deposit with similar maturities in our market, or when obtaining them allowed us to extend the maturities of our deposits at favorable rates compared to borrowing funds with similar maturities, when we are seeking to extend the maturities of our funding to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. Brokered certificates of deposit provide a large deposit for us at a lower operating cost as compared to non-brokered certificates of deposit since we only have one account to maintain versus several accounts with multiple interest and maturity checks. Unlike non-brokered certificates of deposit where the deposit amount can be withdrawn with a penalty for any reason, including increasing interest rates, a brokered certificate of deposit can only be withdrawn in the event of the death or court declared mental incompetence of the depositor. This allows us to better manage the maturity of our deposits and our interest rate risk. We also at times utilize brokers to obtain money market account deposits. The rate we pay on brokered money market accounts is similar to the rate we pay on non-brokered money market accounts, and the rate is agreed to in a contract between the Bank and the broker. These accounts are similar to brokered certificates of deposit accounts in that we only maintain one account for the total deposit per broker, with the broker maintaining the detailed records of each depositor. Additionally, we place a portion of our government deposits in the IntraFi Network money market or demand product, which prior to 2018 was considered a brokered deposit, does not require us to provide collateral. This allows us to invest our funds in higher yielding assets. The Bank had $178.9 million in brokered NOW accounts and $251.1 million of brokered money market accounts at December 31, 2021. The Bank had $720.1 million in brokered demand accounts and $102.9 million brokered money market accounts at December 31, 2020.\nThe FDIC has promulgated regulations implementing limitations on brokered deposits. Under the regulations, well-capitalized institutions are not subject to brokered deposit limitations, while adequately capitalized institutions are able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to restrictions on the interest rate that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are not permitted to accept brokered deposits. Pursuant to the regulation, the Bank, as a well-capitalized institution, may accept brokered deposits. Should our capital ratios decline, this could limit our ability to replace brokered deposits when they mature. At December 31, 2021, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for purposes of these regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank will continue to meet those requirements. Limitations on the Bank\u2019s ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason (including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets) in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity. Any limitation on the interest rates the Bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe maturity of brokered certificates of deposit could result in a significant funding source maturing at one time. Should this occur, it might be difficult to replace the maturing certificates with new brokered certificates of deposit. We have used brokers to obtain these deposits which results in depositors with whom we have no other relationships since these depositors are outside of our market, and there may not be a sufficient source of new brokered certificates of deposit at the time of maturity. In addition, upon maturity, brokers could require us to offer some of the highest interest rates in the country to retain these deposits, which would negatively impact our earnings.\nThe Markets in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive\nWe face intense and increasing competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. Our market area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than us, and all of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Particularly intense competition exists for deposits and in all of the lending activities we emphasize. Our competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, finance companies and credit unions. Management anticipates that competition for mortgage loans will continue to\nincrease in the future. Our most direct competition for deposits historically has come from savings banks, other commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. In addition, we face competition for deposits from products offered by brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, such as money market and other mutual funds and annuities. Consolidation in the banking industry and the lifting of interstate banking and branching restrictions have made it more difficult for smaller, community-oriented banks, such as us, to compete effectively with large, national, regional and super-regional banking institutions. Our Internet Branch provides us access to consumers in markets outside our geographic locations. The internet banking arena exposes us to competition with many larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than we do.\nOur Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in National and/or Local Economic Conditions\nOur operating results are affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions, including changes in market interest rates, the strength of the local economy, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. During the Great Recession, for example, unemployment increased, the housing market in the United States experienced a significant slowdown, and foreclosures rose. Adverse economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans or withdrawing their funds on deposit at the Bank to meet their financial obligations. A decline in the local or national economy or the New York City metropolitan area real estate market could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including through decreased demand for loans or increased competition for good loans, increased non-performing loans and credit losses resulting in additional provisions for credit losses and for losses on real estate owned. Many factors could require additions to our allowance for credit losses in future periods above those currently maintained. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) adverse changes in economic conditions and changes in interest rates that may affect the ability of borrowers to make payments on loans, (2) changes in the financial capacity of individual borrowers, (3) changes in the local real estate market and the value of our loan collateral, and (4) future review and evaluation of our loan portfolio, internally or by regulators. The amount of our allowance for credit losses at any time represents good faith estimates that are susceptible to significant changes due to changes in appraisal values of collateral, national and local economic conditions, prevailing interest rates and other factors. See \u201cBusiness - General - Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nThese same factors could cause delinquencies to increase for the mortgages which are the collateral for the mortgage-backed securities we hold in our investment portfolio. Combining increased delinquencies with liquidity problems in the market could result in a decline in the market value of our investments in privately issued mortgage-backed securities. There can be no assurance that a decline in the market value of these investments will not result in other-than-temporary impairment charges in our financial statements.\nChanges in Laws and Regulations Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nFrom time to time, legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, is enacted or regulations are promulgated that have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the New York legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies. There can be no assurance as to the impact that any laws, regulations or governmental programs that may be introduced or implemented in the future will have on the financial markets and the economy, any of which could adversely affect our business. For a discussion of regulations affecting us, see \u201cBusiness -Regulation\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Federal, State and Local Taxation\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nCurrent Conditions in, and Regulation of, the Banking Industry May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Results of Operations\nFinancial institutions have been the subject of significant legislative and regulatory changes, including the adoption of The Dodd Frank Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulations affecting us, and may be the subject of further significant legislation or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations, including those with respect to federal and state taxation, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the cost and burden of compliance, over time, have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe Bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. Failure to adhere to these minimums could limit the dividends the Bank may pay, including the payment of dividends to the Company, and could limit the annual growth of the Bank. Under the Dodd Frank Act, banks with assets greater than $10.0 billion in total assets are required to complete stress tests, which predict capital levels under certain stress levels. Although, our total assets are currently $8.0 billion, as a best practice, we completed these tests. As of December 31, 2021, under all stress scenarios, we remained well capitalized per current regulations. See \u201cRegulation.\u201d At the New York State level, the Bank is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYDFS\u201d) and the FDIC. The Company is subject to similar regulations and oversight by the Federal Reserve Bank. Such regulation limits the manner in which the Company and Bank conduct business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulation is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and the Bank\u2019s depositors, and not to benefit the Bank or its creditors. The regulatory structure also provides the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company and Bank to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company and Bank.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in significant part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the Company\u2019s net interest margin. Governmental policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve or governmental policies are beyond the Company\u2019s control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on the Company\u2019s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nA Failure in or Breach of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber-attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses\nWe depend upon our ability to process, record and monitor our client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities, may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablet PC\u2019s, personal computers and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our clients\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. We may be subject to increasingly more risk related to security systems for our Internet Branch as we expand our suite of online direct banking products, acquire new or outsource some of our business operations, expand our internal usage of\nweb-based products and applications, and otherwise attempt to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the financial services industry.\nWe rely on external infrastructure, proprietary information technology and third-party systems and services to conduct business, including customer service, marketing and sales activities, customer relationship management, producing financial statements and technology/data centers. In addition, we store and process confidential and proprietary business information on both company-owned and third-party and/or vendor managed systems, including cloud service providers. We increasingly rely on the internet in order to conduct business and may be adversely impacted by outages in critical infrastructure such as electric grids, undersea cables, satellites or other communications used by us or our third parties. This reliance includes consumer access to the internet and communications systems due to more work taking place outside of corporate locations. The failure of our or any third party\u2019s information technology, infrastructure or other internal and external systems, for any reason, could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of business and adversely impact our profitability. Any compromise of the security of our or any third party\u2019s systems that results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer or employee information could damage our reputation, deter customers from purchasing our products and services, expose us to litigation, increase regulatory scrutiny and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses. We may also be adversely impacted by successful cyberattacks of our partners, third-party vendors and others in our supply chain with whom we conduct business or share information.\nFinancial services companies are regularly targeted by cyber criminals, resulting in unauthorized access to confidential information, theft of funds from online accounts, disruption or degradation of service or other damage. These attacks may take a variety of forms, including web application attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, other malware, and social engineering, including phishing. Information security incidents may also occur due to the failure to control access to, and use of, sensitive systems or information by our workforce, with a potential increase in this threat due to the increase in remote work. The failure of our controls (such as policies, procedures, security controls and monitoring, automation and backup plans) designed to prevent, or limit the effect of, failure, inadvertent use or abuse could result in disruptions or breaches beyond our control. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients, or cyberattacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in significant legal and financial exposure, client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs and/or additional compliance costs, a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, any of which may not be covered by insurance and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, in 2017, the NYDFS established comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies, including us. See Regulation - New York State Law.\nChanges in Cybersecurity or Privacy Regulations may Increase our Compliance Costs, Limit Our Ability to Gain Insight from Data and Lead to Increased Scrutiny\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use information from and about our customers, plan participants and website and application users, including personal information and other data. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to customers or third parties, data disclosure and consent obligations or privacy or security-related legal obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements critical of us. Such actual or perceived failures could also cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRestrictions on data collection and use may limit opportunities to gain business insights useful to running our business and offering innovative products and services.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and international regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal information. These laws vary widely by jurisdiction. Privacy regulations with a significant impact on our operations include the New York Department of Financial Services Part 500 cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies. Similar legislation is being enacted around the world with requirements and protections specific to data security requirements, notification requirements for data breaches, the right to access personal data and the right to be forgotten. Changes in existing cybersecurity and privacy regulations or the enactment of new regulations may increase our compliance costs and failure to comply with these regulations may lead to reputational damage, fines or civil damages and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nOur New Arrangement with NYDIG to Offer NYDIG\u2019s Bitcoin Services to Our Customers May Expose Us to Risks\nThe Company has recently arranged with the New York Digital Investment Group (\u201cNYDIG\u201d) to offer bitcoin services to the Bank\u2019s customers at the customers\u2019 request. NYDIG, through its subsidiaries, holds certain cryptocurrency and money transmitter licenses and will be permitted to provide custody, execution, buying, selling, or holding bitcoin-related services to the Bank\u2019s customers. The Bank holds no such licenses and will provide no such services. Through the arrangement, the Bank will offer its customers access to these services from NYDIG. Although we will not provide these services to our customers and intend to limit our role to providing to our customers access to these services from NYDIG, we may be exposed to risks surrounding this product offering. NYDIG is regulated by the NYDFS. One of the purposes of the Bank offering access to NYDIG\u2019s services is for the Bank to attract new customers.\nBitcoin is not generally widely accepted in commercial contexts, and the Bank\u2019s association with bitcoin, albeit indirectly, in the event of any adverse developments regarding cryptocurrencies in general, or bitcoin in particular, even if not applicable directly to the Bank, could have an adverse effect on us. Such effect could be on our business, prospects, reputation or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin acquired or held by our customers, thus harming them and, indirectly, us.\nThere are risks associated with bitcoin and such risks will continue to evolve and may increase. The Bank and NYDIG will monitor these risks as they evolve and intend to respond accordingly.\nNYDIG will charge directly to our customers transaction fees for its bitcoin-related services to those customers. NYDIG will share a portion of those fees with us. Although the fees charged by NYDIG will be solely for the services it will provide directly to our customers, our customers may misconstrue the Bank\u2019s participation in, including earning fees shared from, the arrangement as more than just offering our customers a convenience. In the event of customer dissatisfaction with NYDIG for any reason, including poor performance by bitcoin in general or of NYDIG, there can be no assurances that we would not be adversely impacted by such dissatisfaction reputationally.\nThere can be no assurances that our arrangement with NYDIG will sustain, be successful or not have unintended or unforeseen adverse consequences. It is expected that similar arrangements by or among other financial institutions and bitcoin service providers may emerge and compete with us and/or NYDIG, particularly as cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products and services evolve and proliferate. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that adverse developments in the public acceptance, perception, regulatory environment, licensure, holding, trading, custodianship, value or other aspects of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general will not have a material adverse effect on us, including reputationally.\nThere can be no assurance that the arrangement with NYDIG will result in an increase in new customers or core deposits.\nWe May Experience Increased Delays in Foreclosure Proceedings\nForeclosure proceedings face increasing delays. While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any delay in foreclosure sales, we may be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current foreclosure activities. Delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations and make it more difficult for us to prevent losses in our loan portfolio.\nOur Inability to Hire or Retain Key Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain and attract key personnel. We face intense competition from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, finance companies and credit unions. As a result, it could prove difficult to retain and attract key personnel. The inability to hire or retain key personnel may result in the loss of customer relationships and may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe Are Not Required to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock\nHolders of shares of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. A reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere is Uncertainty Surrounding the Elimination of LIBOR and the Proposed Transition to SOFR or Other Adjustable or Reference Rate Formulas\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Consequently, LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates around the world are undergoing a transition to other reference rates. In March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, with the exception of the most commonly used tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, which will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. The transition to other reference rates may affect the value of certain derivatives, loans and floating rate securities we hold, floating rate financial instruments we have issued and the profitability of certain lending activity. Additionally, pricing activities, models and the profitability of certain businesses may also be impacted.\nThere is still uncertainty around how quickly different alternative rates will develop sufficient liquidity and industry-wide usage, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. The U.S. Federal Reserve, based on the recommendations of the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Alternative Reference Rate Committee (comprised of major derivative market participants and their regulators), began publishing in April 2018 a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Proposals for alternative reference rates have also been announced or have already begun publication. Markets are developing in response to these new rates. We have undertaken an enterprise-wide effort to address the transition to minimize the potential for adverse impacts.\nThe effect of any changes to LIBOR or discontinuation of LIBOR on new or existing financial instruments, liabilities or operational processes will vary depending on a number of factors. Examples of potential factors include, but are not limited to: fallback provisions in contracts; adoption of replacement language in contracts where such language is currently absent; legislative remedies that address fallback provisions; potential changes in spreads causing valuation changes; treatment of hedge effectiveness and impacts on models and systems. We are identifying, assessing and monitoring market and regulatory developments; assessing agreement terms and continue to execute our operational readiness.\nWe have loans, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create additional costs and risks. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates may differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, systems, contracts, valuation tools, and product design. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation and potentially introduce additional legal risks. As of December 31, 2021, we have exposure to approximately $2.3 billion of financial assets and liabilities, including off-balance sheet instruments, which are LIBOR-based. We do not yet know whether, and if so the extent to which, the elimination of LIBOR will have any material impact on these instruments.\nOur Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by Global Climate Changes.\nAtmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution, resulting in a gradual increase in average global temperatures and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. These trends are expected to continue in the future and have the potential to impact nearly all sectors of the economy to varying degrees. We cannot predict the long-term impacts of climate change, but we will continue to monitor new developments in the future.\nPotential impacts may include the following:\n\u25cf Changes in temperatures and air quality may adversely impact the health, welfare, economic and other prospects of customers in our target markets. For example, increases in the level of pollution and airborne allergens in local industrial areas may cause an increase in upper respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Such impacts may adversely change the long-term prospects for the communities we serve and the investing and banking services these communities seek.\n\u25cf Climate change may impact asset prices, as well as general economic conditions. For example, rising sea levels may lead to decreases in real estate values in at-risk areas. Additionally, government policies to slow climate change (e.g., setting limits on carbon emissions) may have an adverse impact on sectors such as utilities, transportation and manufacturing. Changes in asset prices may impact the value of our fixed income, real estate and commercial mortgage investments. Although we seek to manage our investment risks by maintaining a diversified portfolio and monitor our investments on an ongoing basis, allowing us to adjust our exposure to sectors and/or geographical areas that face severe risks due to climate change, there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful.\nOur Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by ESG Requirements\nOur financial and operational results could be impacted by emerging risk and changes to the regulatory landscape in areas like environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) requirements. We closely monitor and respond to topics related to ESG that include longer lifespans, income and wealth inequalities, environmental challenges and opportunities to expand global access to the financial system across all segments of the population. Updated and changing regulatory and societal environment requirements could impact financial and operational results.\nWe currently obtain environmental reports in connection with the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, and typically obtain environmental reports in connection with the underwriting of multi-family loans. For all other loans, we obtain environmental reports only if the nature of the current or, to the extent known to us, prior use of the property securing the loan indicates a potential environmental risk. However, we may not be aware of such uses or risks in any particular case, and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that real estate acquired by us in foreclosure is free from environmental contamination nor we will not have any liability with respect thereto.\nChanges and uncertainty in United States legislation, policy or regulation regarding climate risk management or other ESG practices may result in higher regulatory and compliance costs, increased capital expenditures, and changes in regulations may impact security asset prices, resulting in realized or unrealized losses on our investments. Physical risks and transitional risks could increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business and actual or perceived failure to adequately address ESG expectations of our various stakeholders could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers and clients.", "PERMNO": 82573, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FFIC"}
