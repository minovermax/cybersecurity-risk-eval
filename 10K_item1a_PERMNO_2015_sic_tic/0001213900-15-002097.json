{"cik": "811641", "company": "IMMUCELL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to: projections of future financial performance; the scope and timing of future product development work and commercialization of our products; future costs of product development efforts; the estimated prevalence rate of subclinical mastitis; future market share of and revenue generated by products still in development; future sources of financial support for our product development, manufacturing and marketing efforts; the future adequacy of our own manufacturing facilities or those of third parties with which we have contractual relationships to meet demand for our products on a timely basis; the amount and timing of future investments in facility modifications and production equipment; the future adequacy of our working capital and the availability of third party financing; timing and future costs of a facility to produce the Drug Substance (active pharmaceutical ingredient) for Mast Out\u00ae; the timing and outcome of pending or anticipated applications for future regulatory approvals; future regulatory requirements relating to our products; future expense ratios and margins; future compliance with bank debt covenants; future realization of deferred tax assets; costs associated with sustaining compliance with cGMP regulations in our current operations and attaining such compliance for the facility to produce the Drug Substance for Mast Out\u00ae; factors that may affect the dairy and beef industries and future demand for our products; the cost-effectiveness of additional sales and marketing expenditures and resources; the accuracy of our understanding of our distributors\u2019 ordering patterns; anticipated changes in our manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies; anticipated competitive and market conditions; and any other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201caims\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, \u201ctargets\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cforecasts\u201d and similar words and expressions. In addition, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those risks and uncertainties relating to difficulties or delays in development, testing, regulatory approval, production and marketing of our products, competition within our anticipated product markets, alignment between our manufacturing resources and product demand, the uncertainties associated with product development and Drug Substance manufacturing, our potential reliance upon third parties for financial support, products and services, changes in laws and regulations, decision making by regulatory authorities, currency fluctuations and other risks detailed from time to time in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. Such statements are based on our current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including the risk factors summarized below and uncertainties otherwise referred to in this Annual Report.\nImmuCell Corporation\nProjection of net income: After nine consecutive years of reporting net income, we reported net losses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, due in large part to our product development strategy. By reducing our investment in the development of Mast Out\u00ae and increasing sales of First Defense\u00ae, we were able to record net operating income of $245,000 and net income of $90,000 during the year ended December 31, 2012. We continued this positive trend by recording a net operating (loss) of just ($20,000) and net income of $117,000 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The 2013 results included a $250,000 exclusive license option fee. Given our strategic decision to invest approximately $973,000 during 2014 in facilities for the manufacture of the Drug Substance, we recorded a net (loss) of ($167,000) during the year ended December 31, 2014 as expected, despite a return to profitability during the last six months of 2014. We expect the sales growth trend for First Defense\u00ae, and the profitability trend recorded during the last six months of 2014, to continue into 2015. Generally speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to numerous factors that are difficult to predict or that are beyond our control. Stronger than expected sales of First Defense\u00ae, for example, could increase our net income. Conversely, weaker than expected sales of First Defense\u00ae could lead to less profits or an operating loss. Large investments in product development can result in a net loss.\nReliance on sales of First Defense\u00ae: We are heavily reliant on the market acceptance of First Defense\u00ae to generate product sales and fund our operations. Our business would not have been profitable during the nine consecutive years in the period ended December 31, 2007, or during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, or during the second half of 2014, without the gross margin that we earned on sales of First Defense\u00ae.\nConcentration of sales: Approximately 83% of our product sales were made to customers in the U.S. dairy and beef industries during both of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 96% of our product sales were made to customers in the dairy and beef industries throughout the world, in comparison to 97% during 2013. A large portion of our product sales (61%, 60% and 55% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively) was made to two large distributors (adjusting for an acquisition made by one of these distributors). A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (71% and 65% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively) was due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors, but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related to such customers experiencing financial difficulties or altering the basis on which they do business with us.\nEconomics of the dairy and beef industries:\n\u25cf All cattle and calves in the United States as of July 1, 2014 totaled 95,000,000 head, which is 3% below the 97,800,000 head reported on July 1, 2012 (this data point was not reported as of July 1, 2013). The July 2014 amount was the lowest inventory count as of July 1st in decades. All cattle and calves in the United States as of January 1, 2015 totaled 89,800,000, which is 1.5% higher than January 1, 2014. According to a Purdue University Extension economist, this is the first increase in the cattle inventory since 2007 suggesting a faster rebuilding of the U.S. herd than had been anticipated.\n\u25cf From 1998 through 2014, the size (annual average) of the U.S. dairy herd ranged from approximately the low of 9,011,000 (2004) to the high of 9,315,000 (2008). The average for 2013 was 9,215,000 which represents a slight reduction from the average of 9,232,000 reported for 2012. This average increased slightly to 9,255,000 during 2014.\n\u25cf While the number of cows in the U.S. herd and the production of milk per cow directly influence the supply of milk, demand for milk is also influenced by very volatile international demand for milk products. The Class III milk price (an industry benchmark that reflects the value of product used to make cheese) is an important indicator because it defines our customers\u2019 revenue level. This milk price (measured in dollars per hundred pounds of milk) in each of the first eleven months of 2014 was the highest ever for those months, and nine out of ten of the highest Class III milk prices of all time occurred during 2014. The annual average price level for 2011 of $18.37 was higher than the annual average reached in any of the previous 30 years. This annual average price level for 2014 of $22.34 (peaking at $24.60 in September 2014) was the highest level since these records were first reported in 1980. This strong price level has declined recently. The December 2014 price was $17.82, and the January 2015 price was $16.18, and the February 2015 price decreased further to $15.46.\nImmuCell Corporation\nThe recent annual fluctuations in this milk price level are demonstrated in the following table:\nThe actual level of milk prices may be less important than its level relative to feed costs. The 2014 improvement in milk prices has been matched by slightly lower feed costs. One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio, which represents the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. It is considered profitable to buy feed and produce milk if this ratio meets or exceeds 3.0. This benchmark level means that a dairy producer could buy 3.0 pounds of feed for every pound of milk sold. The 2012 ratio of 1.52 was the lowest recorded since this ratio was first reported in 1985. The highest annual average this ratio has ever reached since 1985 was 3.64 in 1987. Since this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded this benchmark level of 3.0. The annual average of 2.54 for 2014 was the highest this ratio has been since 2007 (2.81). The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low values of this ratio recently:\nApproximately half of all U.S. dairy farms (more than 23,000) representing more than 60% of the nation\u2019s total milk production signed up for the Margin Protection Program (MPP) under the 2014 federal farm bill. This voluntary program provides financial assistance to participating farmers when the margin (the difference between the price of milk and feed costs) falls below the selected coverage level. To display the margin between milk revenue and the MPP feed cost over the years, Dr. D. Scott Brown of the University of Missouri charted the relationship of revenue to expenses graphically in the following table (the 2014 figures are preliminary and the 2015 figures are projected):\nImmuCell Corporation\nReprinted by permission from the December 2014 issue of Hoard\u2019s Dairyman.\nCopyright 2014 by W.D. Hoard and Sons Company, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.\nAn increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry. Widespread severe drought conditions in key U.S. agricultural regions during 2012 drove feed costs higher and the inventory of all cattle and calves lower. The recent positive trend in these market indices has resulted in an increase in the value of milk cows. The 2014 annual average price for a milk cow increased to $1,835. This annual average price since 1970 was only higher when it reached $1,840 in 2007 and $1,953 in 2008. The industry data referred to above is compiled from USDA databases. Recently, the value of newborn bull calves has risen to the unusually high level of approximately $300 to $400. At this price, producers are more likely to invest in First Defense\u00ae for their bull calves. Given our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the financial insecurity of our primary end users is a risk to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. It also heightens the challenge of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as Mast Out\u00ae) into such a market.\nProduct development risks: The development of new products is subject to financial, scientific, regulatory and market risks. Our current business growth strategy relies heavily on the development of Mast Out\u00ae, which requires (and will continue to require) a substantial investment. Our efforts will be subject to inspection and approval by the FDA. There is no assurance whether or when we will obtain all of the data necessary to support regulatory approval for this product.\nRegulatory requirements for Mast Out\u00ae: The commercial introduction of Mast Out\u00ae in the United States will require us to obtain appropriate FDA approval for this product. It presently is uncertain when or if this approval will be achieved. We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors that we choose to work with to produce Mast Out\u00ae, who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order to provide us with the products and services we need. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales outside of the United States. European regulatory authorities are not expected to approve a product with a zero milk discard claim, which would remove a significant competitive advantage of Mast Out\u00ae in that territory. However, the assigned milk discard period may be shorter for Mast Out\u00ae than it is for other products on the market in Europe.\nRisks associated with Mast Out\u00ae funding strategy: Completing the development of Mast Out\u00ae through to the submission of the administrative NADA to the FDA involves a great deal of risk. Our current strategy is to build our own small-scale Drug Substance production plant in order to gain NADA approval, obtain better production cost data and test market the product. This facility must be approved by the FDA. Uncertainty concerning the availability and terms of financing to develop a larger-scale commercial production plant or alternatively the availability and terms of potential partnering arrangements is a risk that, if materialized, could delay or preclude meaningful commercialization of Mast Out\u00ae.\nImmuCell Corporation\nUncertainty of market size and product sales estimates: Even assuming that Mast Out\u00ae achieves regulatory approval in the United States with a zero milk discard requirement, estimating the size of the market for this product is subject to numerous uncertainties. Some of the uncertainties surrounding our product include the development of the subclinical mastitis treatment market, coverage of relevant pathogens, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, cost of manufacture, integration of milk from treated cows with susceptible cheese starter cultures and market acceptance.\nCompetition from others: Many of our competitors are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do, including greater ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues and/or profitability. Zoetis, Elanco and Boehringer Ingelheim, among other companies, sell products that compete directly with First Defense\u00ae in preventing scours in newborn calves. The market for the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows is highly competitive, and presently is dominated by large companies such as Zoetis, Merck and Boehringer Ingelheim. There is no assurance that Mast Out\u00ae will compete successfully in this market. We may not be aware of other companies that compete with us or intend to compete with us in the future.\nAccess to raw materials: Our policy is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test our products. However, there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies. The loss of farms from which we buy raw material for First Defense\u00ae could make it difficult for us to produce enough inventory until supply agreements are reached with replacement farms on suitable terms. We are dependent on our manufacturing facility and operations at 56 Evergreen Drive in Portland, Maine for the production of First Defense\u00ae and Wipe Out\u00ae Dairy Wipes. The specific antibodies that we purify for First Defense\u00ae and the Nisin we produce by fermentation for Wipe Out\u00ae Dairy Wipes are not readily available from other sources. We will also be reliant on this facility for the production of the Drug Substance required to obtain regulatory approval. We expect to be dependent on Plas-Pak and (subject to the performance issues discussed above under ITEM 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, \u201cProduct Development\u201d) Norbrook for a significant portion of the manufacture of Mast Out\u00ae if that product proceeds to commercialization. Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at these facilities could adversely affect the production of inventory and result in significant added expenses and loss of sales.\nRisk of sales order backlog: Given our recent and significant increase in sales demand, our manufacturing resources (internal and third party) are no longer sufficient to avoid a backlog of orders. Until we complete the additional investments required to further increase our production capacity, we are at risk of losing customers that are unable to acquire our product on a timely basis. We understand that the competitive products marketed by Elanco and Boehringer Ingelheim are experiencing a disruption in supply to the market.\nSmall size; dependence on key personnel: We are a small company with 34 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. As such, we rely on certain key employees to support different operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, managerial and sales and marketing personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.\nFailure to protect intellectual property: In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our manufacturing techniques and processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our products or achieve our business goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents on terms that are acceptable. There is also a risk that competitors could challenge the claims in patents that have been issued to us.\nImmuCell Corporation\nNo expectation to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future: We do not anticipate paying any dividends to, or repurchasing stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development costs and investments in our facility and production equipment. Any debt or equity financing we obtain to assist in funding our product development programs may include terms prohibiting or restricting our paying dividends or repurchasing stock for a lengthy period. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\t\nMarket for common stock: Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NasdaqCM: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume is lower than the volume for most other companies and the bid/ask stock price spread can be larger, which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. There has been a significant increase in the stock market activity of animal health companies since early 2013 in comparison to years past. Listed in chronological order by date of financing, companies such as Zoetis (ZTS), Aratana Therapeutics (PETX), Kindred (KIN), Phibro (PAHC), Parnell (PARN) and Nexvet Biopharma (NVET) have completed initial public offerings since 2013. The stock price of some of these companies has been volatile.\nStock market valuation: There are companies in the animal health sector with market capitalization values that greatly exceed our current market capitalization of approximately $20,000,000. Some of these companies have no product sales. We currently have annual product sales approaching $8,000,000. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily dependent on the perceived potential for growth from our products under development.\nCertain provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management: Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Common Stock Rights Plan or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf limitations on the removal of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to refuse to redeem rights issued under our Common Stock Rights Plan or otherwise to limit or suspend its operation that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.\nRegulatory requirements for First Defense\u00ae: First Defense\u00ae is sold in the United States subject to a product license from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991. Similar regulatory oversight risks exist in territories outside of the United States where we sell our products. The potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the \u201cReference Standard\u201d). Due to the unique nature of the First Defense\u00ae label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability. However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product.\nImmuCell Corporation\nRegulatory requirements for Wipe Out\u00ae Dairy Wipes: While the FDA regulates the manufacture and sale of Wipe Out\u00ae Dairy Wipes, this type of product is permitted to be sold without a NADA approval, in accordance with the FDA\u2019s Compliance Policy Guide 7125.30 (\u201cTeat Dips and Udder Washes for Dairy Cows and Goats\u201d). This policy guide could be withdrawn at the FDA\u2019s discretion, in which case we would likely discontinue sales of the product. The manufacture of Wipe Out\u00ae Dairy Wipes is subject to Part 211 of the cGMP regulations. As a result, our operations are subject to inspection by the FDA. During the second quarter of 2007, the FDA inspected our facilities and operations and issued a Warning Letter to us, citing deficiencies in specific areas of the cGMP regulations. We filed an initial response to the FDA during the second quarter of 2007, and we responded to a request for additional information during the second quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2013, the FDA again inspected our facilities and operations. The report from this inspection was very favorable, and we responded to the few, minor observations that were noted. We remain subject to the risk of adverse action by the FDA in this respect.\nProduct risks generally: The sale of our products is subject to financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain the regulatory compliance required to continue selling our products. There is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market acceptance at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin to justify their continued manufacture and sale.\nProduct liability: The manufacture and sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our products are principally directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained product liability insurance in an amount which we believe is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We have no history of claims of this nature being made.\nRisks associated with USDA and international regulatory oversight: First Defense\u00ae is subject to the jurisdiction of the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA. Similar regulatory oversight risks exist in territories outside of the United States where we sell our products.\nExposure to risks associated with the financial downturn and global economic crisis: The U.S. economy appears to be coming out of a recession, which was caused principally by the housing, credit and financial crises of the late 2000\u2019s. However, such recent positive indications could prove temporary and further downturn could occur, and the European economy remains sluggish and precarious. The credit markets continue to be very turbulent and uncertain. Sales and financial performance are still down at many businesses. This extraordinary period of instability facing the U.S. economy and the financial markets has been troubling for nearly all Americans. Some observers believe that the national unemployment rate is too high, the housing market remains problematic for the overall U.S. economy, the United States has taken on too much national debt and the equity markets are overvalued. A continued and prolonged economic downturn could have a corresponding negative effect on our business and operations, including the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability to penetrate international markets.\nBovine diseases: The potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States have led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine. First Defense\u00ae is considered a veterinary medicine rather than a feed ingredient, and it is manufactured from bovine milk (colostrum), which is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase protection of the human food supply could affect First Defense\u00ae, although presently we do not anticipate that this will be the case.\nBiological terrorism: The threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both the economic health of our customers and our ability to economically acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms. Any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry could adversely affect our operations.\nCost burdens of our reporting obligations as a public company: Operating a public company involves substantial costs to comply with reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nImmuCell Corporation", "PERMNO": 11292, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ICCC"}
