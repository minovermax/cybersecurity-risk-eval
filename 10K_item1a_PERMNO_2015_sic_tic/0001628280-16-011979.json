Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and other written reports and oral statements we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cprojection,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201ceffort,\u201d \u201ctarget\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to a material difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and the risks discussed in the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report speak only as of the date hereof, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, changes in expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nEconomic recessions and other factors that reduce freight volumes could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, increases in prices charged by third-party carriers, interest rate fluctuations and other U.S. and global economic factors beyond our control. During economic downturns, reduced overall demand for transportation services will likely reduce demand for our services and exert downward pressures on rates and margins. In periods of strong economic growth, demand for limited transportation resources can result in increased network congestion and resulting operating inefficiencies. In addition, deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks that may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our long-term growth goals. These risks may include the following:\n\u2022\nA reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth. In addition, if a downturn in our customers\u2019 business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase.\n\u2022\nA significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of\nrapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. In addition, we have other primarily variable expenses that are fixed for a period of time and certain significant fixed expenses, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs, our business could suffer.\nCompetition in the transportation services industry is intense. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our profitability, including the following:\n\u2022\ncompetition with other transportation services companies, some of which offer different services or have a broader coverage network, more fully developed information technology systems and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022\nreduction by our competitors of their rates to gain business, especially during times of declining economic growth, which reductions may limit our ability to maintain or increase rates, maintain our operating margins or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by shippers of bids from multiple transportation providers for their shipping needs and the resulting depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors;\n\u2022\nestablishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs;\n\u2022\nour current or prospective customers may decide to develop internal capabilities for some of the services that we provide; and\n\u2022\nthe development of new technologies or business models could result in our disintermediation in certain businesses, such as freight brokerage.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely impacted if our investments in equipment, service centers and warehouses do not match customer demand for these resources or if there is a decline in the availability of funding sources for these investments.\nOur LTL and full truckload operations require significant investments in revenue equipment, and our LTL operations also require significant investments in freight service centers. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including anticipated volume levels and the price and availability of appropriate-use property for service centers and newly-manufactured tractors (which are subject to restrictive Environmental Protection Agency engine-design requirements). If anticipated service center and/or fleet requirements differ materially from actual usage, our capital-intensive business units, specifically LTL and full truckload, may have too much or too little capacity. We attempt to mitigate the risk associated with too much or too little revenue equipment capacity by adjusting capital expenditures and by utilizing short-term equipment rentals and sub-contracted operators in order to match capacity with business volumes. Our investments in revenue equipment and LTL service centers depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our access to credit, debt and equity capital markets. A decline in the availability of these funding sources could adversely affect us.\nWith respect to our contract logistics operations, implementing warehouse-management services for customers can require a significant commitment of capital in the form of shelving, racking and other warehousing systems. In the event that we are not able to fully amortize the cost of the capital across the term of the related customer agreement, or to the extent that the customer defaults on its obligations under the agreement, we could be forced to take a significant loss on the unrecovered portion of this capital cost.\nThe significant acquisitions we have recently completed, including acquisitions of non-U.S.-based companies, put us at a heightened risk for failures in internal controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, earnings, financial position and outlook.\nWe have grown significantly through acquisitions, including the ND and Con-way acquisitions in 2015. ND\u2019s business was headquartered in France and primarily operated in Europe and Asia; accordingly, it was subject to different standards and rules than U.S. public companies. Effective internal controls over financial processes and reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully. Our efforts to implement or revise internal control systems in our acquired businesses, including particularly ND, may not be successful or such implementation or revisions may not be completed on the timeline we expect. Any failure in internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, earnings, financial position and outlook.\nAnticipated synergies from any acquisitions that we have undertaken may not materialize in the expected timeframe or at all.\nOur 2016 and mid-term financial targets are dependent on our ability to realize significant synergies with respect to our recent acquisitions, especially the October 2015 Con-way acquisition. We may not realize any or all of the synergies that we currently anticipate from any acquisitions that we have undertaken. Among the synergies that we currently expect are cross-selling\nopportunities to existing customers of XPO and the companies we have acquired, network synergies and other operational synergies. Our estimated synergies from any acquisitions that we have undertaken are subject to a number of assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing such synergies. Such assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competition risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such assumptions turn out to be correct and, as a result, the amount of synergies that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ significantly (and may be significantly lower) from the ones that we currently estimate and we may incur significant costs in reaching the estimated synergies. We may not be successful in integrating some or all these businesses as currently anticipated, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe have grown rapidly and substantially over the prior four years, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions and entering into new markets, and we intend to continue with rapid growth, primarily organically in 2016. We may experience difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets, change in revenue and business models and entering into new geographic areas.\nOur growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will continue to increase substantially as our operations grow. Failure to manage growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, stock price and financial condition.\nOur business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate our information technology systems.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems to efficiently run our business, and they are a key component of our growth strategy. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our proprietary technology platform in response to these trends, which may lead to significant ongoing software development costs. We may be unable to accurately determine the needs of our customers and the trends in the transportation services industry or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our technology platform in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues. Despite testing, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to the stability or effectiveness of our information technology systems and operations. We may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyber-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to customers or others, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. We must maintain and enhance the reliability and speed of our information technology systems to remain competitive and effectively handle higher volumes of freight through our network and the various service modes we offer. If our information technology systems are unable to manage additional volume for our operations as our business grows, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various service modes we offer, our service levels and operating efficiency could decline. We expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their transportation providers. If we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems or if we fail to upgrade our systems to meet our customers\u2019 demands, our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could result in a loss of customers or a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nWe are developing proprietary information technology for all of our business segments. Our technology may not be successful or may not achieve the desired results. We may require additional training or different personnel to successfully implement this system, all of which may result in additional expense, delays in obtaining results or disruptions to our operations. In addition, acquired companies will need to be on-boarded onto our technology, which may cause additional training or licensing cost and disruption. In such event, our revenue, financial results and ability to operate profitably could be negatively impacted. The challenges associated with integration of our acquisitions may increase these risks.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $5,407.9 million of total indebtedness and unused commitments of $1.0 billion under our Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Credit Agreement (less $240.6 million in outstanding letters of credit), the availability of which is subject to certain conditions including its borrowing base availability. We incurred this indebtedness in connection with the ND and Con-way acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $289.8 million. We have substantial outstanding indebtedness, which could:\n\u2022\nnegatively affect our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt or dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing or to refinance our indebtedness in the future; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with the covenants under our indebtedness may have a material adverse impact on our operations. If we fail to comply with the covenants under any of our indebtedness, and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, such failure may result in an event of default under our indebtedness. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance our indebtedness if such indebtedness were accelerated upon an event of default.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, we may not be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nThe execution of our strategy could depend on our ability to raise capital in the future, and our inability to do so could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements in order to pursue our growth strategy or operate our businesses. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business or ability to execute our strategy. Further debt financing may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur success is dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and other key personnel.\nOur success depends on the continuing services of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bradley S. Jacobs. We believe that Mr. Jacobs possesses valuable knowledge and skills that are crucial to our success and would be very difficult to replicate.\nOver time, our success will depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel, including our senior management team. Competition for senior management is intense, and we may not be able to retain our management team or attract additional qualified personnel. The loss of a member of senior management would require our remaining senior officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to fulfilling the duties of the departing executive and to seeking a replacement. The inability to adequately fill vacancies in our senior executive positions on a timely basis could negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could adversely impact our results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend on third-parties in the operation of our business.\nIn our global forwarding and freight brokerage operations, we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 freight, and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight. In our full truckload and freight brokerage businesses (particularly our last mile delivery logistics operations, our over-the-road expedite operations and our intermodal drayage operations), we engage independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. Accordingly, we are dependent on third-parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, air and other transportation services and to report certain events to us, including delivery information and cargo claims. This reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing revenue and claims. Our inability to maintain positive relationships with independent transportation providers could significantly limit our ability to serve our customers on competitive terms. If we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers or provide our services on competitive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. Many of these risks are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nequipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers and railroads;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in service or stoppages in transportation as a result of labor disputes, seaport strikes, network congestion, weather-related issues, \u201cActs of God,\u201d or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulations impacting transportation;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses for carriers, such as fuel costs, insurance premiums and licensing expenses, that result in a reduction in available carriers; and\n\u2022\nchanges in transportation rates.\nIncreases in driver compensation and difficulties attracting and retaining drivers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur LTL and full truckload operations are conducted primarily with employee drivers. Recently, there has been intense competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry due to a nationwide shortage of drivers. The availability of qualified drivers may be affected from time to time by changing workforce demographics, competition from other transportation companies and industries for employees, the availability and affordability of driver training schools, changing industry regulations, and the demand for drivers in the labor market. If the industry-wide shortage of qualified drivers continues, these business lines will likely continue to experience difficulty in attracting and retaining enough qualified drivers to fully satisfy customer demands. As a result of the current highly-competitive labor market for drivers, our LTL and full truckload operations may be required to increase driver compensation and benefits in the future, or face difficulty meeting customer demands, all of which could adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in underutilization of our truck fleet, lost revenue, increased costs for purchased transportation or increased costs for driver recruitment.\nIncreases in independent contractor driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified independent contractor drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our independent contractor driver fleet.\nOur expedited transportation and intermodal drayage businesses operate through fleets of vehicles that are owned and operated by independent contractors. Our last mile delivery logistics business also operates through a fleet of independent contract carriers that supply their own vehicles, drivers and helpers. These independent contractors are responsible for maintaining and operating their own equipment and paying their own fuel, insurance, licenses and other operating costs. Turnover and bankruptcy among independent contractor drivers often limit the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers and increase competition for their services. In addition, regulations such as the FMCSA Compliance Safety Accountability program may further reduce the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers. Thus, our continued reliance on independent contractor drivers could limit our ability to grow our ground transportation fleet.\nWe are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience from time to time in the future, difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified independent contractor drivers. Additionally, our agreements with independent contractor drivers are terminable by either party upon short notice and without penalty. Consequently, we regularly need to recruit qualified independent contractor drivers to replace those who have left our fleet. If we are unable to retain our existing independent contractor drivers or recruit new independent contractor drivers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe compensation we offer our independent contractor drivers is subject to market conditions and we may find it necessary to continue to increase independent contractor drivers\u2019 compensation in future periods. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of independent contractor drivers, we could be required to increase our mileage rates and accessorial pay or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, all of which would adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or to pursue our growth strategy.\nCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations, and the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits, multi-plaintiff and individual lawsuits, and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that the Company\u2019s contract carriers or owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as our employees, rather than independent contractors, or that certain of the Company\u2019s drivers were not paid for all compensable time or were not provided with required meal or rest breaks. These lawsuits and proceedings may seek substantial monetary damages (including claims for unpaid wages, overtime, failure to provide meal and rest periods, unreimbursed business expenses and other items), injunctive relief, or both. We incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of these parties as independent contractors. While we believe that our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers are properly classified as independent contractors rather than as employees, adverse decisions have been rendered recently in certain cases pending against us, including with respect to class certification of certain contract carriers and determinations that certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators are improperly classified. Certain of these decisions are subject to appeal, but we cannot provide assurance that we will determine to pursue any appeal or that any such appeal will be successful. Adverse final outcomes in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers to reimbursement with respect to certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for us, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Changes to state laws governing the definition of independent contractors could also impact the status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Adverse final outcomes in these matters or changes to state laws could cause us to change our business model, which could have a material adverse effect on our business strategies, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These claims involve potentially significant classes that could\ninvolve thousands of claimants and, accordingly, significant potential damages and litigation costs, and could lead others to bring similar claims.\nThe independent contractor misclassification matters in which we are currently engaged involve companies that we acquired. Pursuant to the purchase agreements by which we acquired certain private companies, the former owners have agreed to indemnify us for costs and liabilities related to such class action and individual lawsuits, subject to certain limits, and we have retained purchase price holdbacks and escrows as security for such indemnification. Other than with respect to acquisitions for which our acquisition accounting measurement period remains open, we believe that we have adequate purchase price holdbacks or escrows with respect to the potential impact of loss contingencies involving classification matters that are probable and reasonably estimable. However, such holdbacks or escrows may be insufficient to protect us against the full amount of the indemnified liability, in which case we would need to fund any losses from our available liquidity sources. To the extent that we do not have indemnification rights with respect to any such liabilities, or we are unable to collect under any such indemnification agreements, any payments will require utilization of our funds and establishment of reserves.\nWe do not currently expect any of these matters or these matters in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters, or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under the indemnity provisions noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIntermodal Drayage Classification Claims\nCertain of the Company\u2019s intermodal drayage subsidiaries received notices from the California Labor Commissioner, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (the \u201cDLSE\u201d), that a total of approximately 150 owner operators contracted with these subsidiaries filed claims in 2012 with the DLSE in which they assert that they should be classified as employees, as opposed to independent contractors. These claims seek reimbursement for the owner operators\u2019 business expenses, including fuel, tractor maintenance and tractor lease payments. After a decision was rendered by a DLSE hearing officer in seven of these claims, in 2014, the Company appealed the decision to California Superior Court, San Diego, where a de novo trial was held on the merits of those claims. On July 17, 2015, the court issued a final statement of decision finding that the seven claimants were employees rather than independent contractors, and awarding an aggregate of $2.9 million plus post-judgement interest and attorneys\u2019 fees to the claimants. The Company appealed this judgment, but cannot provide assurance that such appeal will be successful. The remaining DLSE claims (the \u201cPending DLSE Claims\u201d) have been transferred to California Superior Court in three separate actions involving approximately 200 claimants, including the approximately 150 claimants mentioned above. These matters are in the initial procedural stages. The Company believes that it has adequately accrued for the potential impact of loss contingencies relating to the Pending DLSE Claims that are probable and reasonably estimable. The Company is unable at this time to estimate the amount of the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of its accrued liability that it may incur as a result of the Pending DLSE Claims.\nOne of these intermodal drayage subsidiaries also is a party to a putative class action litigation (Manuela Ruelas Mendoza v. Pacer Cartage, Inc.) brought by Edwin Molina on August 19, 2013 and currently pending in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of California. Mr. Molina asserts that he should be classified as an employee, as opposed to an independent contractor, and seeks damages for alleged violation of various California wage and hour laws. Mr. Molina seeks to have the litigation certified as a class action involving all owner-operators contracted with this subsidiary at any time from August 2009 to the present, which could involve as many as 600 claimants. Certain of these potential claimants also may have Pending DLSE Claims. This matter is in the initial stages of discovery and the court has not yet determined whether to certify the matter as a class action. The Company has reached an agreement to settle this litigation with the claimant. The settlement agreement has been approved by the court but remains subject to acceptance by a minimum percentage of members of the purported class. There can be no assurance that the settlement agreement will be accepted by the requisite percentage of members of the purported class.\nAnother of the Company\u2019s intermodal drayage subsidiaries is a party to a putative class action litigation (C. Arevalo v. XPO Port Services, Inc.) brought by Carlos Arevalo in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles Central District filed in August 2015. Mr. Arevalo asserts that he should be classified as an employee, as opposed to an independent contractor, and seeks damages for alleged violation of various California wage and hour laws. Mr. Arevalo seeks to have the litigation certified as a class action involving all owner-operators contracted with this subsidiary at any time from August 2011 to the present. Certain of these potential claimants also may have Pending DLSE Claims. This matter is in the initial pleading stage and the court has not yet determined whether to certify the matter as a class action. The Company is unable at this time to estimate the amount of the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that it may incur as a result of this matter.\nLast Mile Logistics Classification Claims\nCertain of the Company\u2019s last mile logistics subsidiaries are party to several putative class action litigations brought by independent contract carriers contracted with these subsidiaries in which the contract carriers assert that they should be classified as employees, as opposed to independent contractors. The particular claims asserted vary from case to case, but the claims generally allege unpaid wages, overtime, alleged failure to provide meal and rest periods and seek reimbursement of the\ncontract carriers\u2019 business expenses. Putative class actions against the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are pending in Massachusetts (Celso Martins, Alexandre Rocha, and Calvin Anderson v. 3PD, Inc. filed in June 2011, pending in U.S. District Court, Massachusetts), Illinois (Marvin Brandon, Rafael Aguilera, and Aldo Mendez-Etzig v. 3PD, Inc. filed in May 2013, pending in U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois), California (Cesar Ardon et al v 3PD, Inc., filed in September 2013, pending in U.S. District Court, Central District of California and Fernando Ruiz v. Affinity Logistics Corp., filed in May 2005, pending in U.S. District Court, Southern District of California), New Jersey (Leonardo Alegre v. Atlantic Central Logistics, Simply Logistics, Inc., filed in March 2015, pending in U.S. District Court, New Jersey), Pennsylvania (Victor Reyes v. XPO Logistics, Inc., filed in May 2015, pending in U.S. District Court, Pennsylvania) and Connecticut (Carlos Taveras v. XPO Last Mile, Inc., filed in November 2015, pending in U.S. District Court, Connecticut). The Company has completed the settlement of the California (Ardon) litigation. The Company also has reached tentative agreements to settle the Massachusetts and Illinois litigations with the respective claimants, subject to court approval (in the case of the Massachusetts litigation) and acceptance by a minimum percentage of members of the respective purported class. There can be no assurance that the settlement agreements will be finalized and executed, that the respective court will approve any such settlement agreement or that it will be accepted by the requisite percentage of members of the respective purported class. The Company believes that it has adequately accrued for the potential impact of loss contingencies relating to the foregoing last mile logistics claims. The Company is unable at this time to estimate the amount of the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of its accrued liability that it may incur as a result of these claims.\nOur overseas operations subject us to various operational and financial risks which could adversely affect our business.\nThe services we provide outside of the United States subject us to risks resulting from changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, tax policies, difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents, different liability standards, issues related to compliance with anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, data protection, trade compliance, and intellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region. As we expand our business in foreign countries, we will also be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls.\nOur European business heavily relies on subcontracting and we use a large number of temporary employees in these operations. Any failure to properly manage our subcontractors or temporary employees in Europe could have a material adverse impact on XPO Logistics Europe\u2019s revenues, earnings, financial position and outlook.\nWe operate in Europe through our majority-owned subsidiary, XPO Logistics Europe SA. Subcontracting plays a key role in our European operations and we subcontract approximately 40% of our transport operations there. We are therefore exposed to various risks arising from managing our subcontractors, such as the risk that they do not fulfill their assignments in a satisfactory manner or within the specified deadlines. Such failures could compromise our ability to honor our commitments to customers, comply with applicable regulations or otherwise meet customers\u2019 expectations. In some situations, poor execution of services by our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating a contract. Such failures by subcontractors could harm our reputation and ability to win new business and could lead to our being liable for contractual damages. Furthermore, in the event of a failure by our subcontractors, we could be required to perform unplanned work or additional services in line with the contracted service, without receiving any additional compensation. Lastly, some of our subcontractors in Europe may not be insured, or may not have sufficient resources available to handle any claims from customers resulting from potential damage and losses relating to their performance of services on our behalf. As a result, non-compliance with their contractual or legal obligations by our subcontractors may have a material adverse effect on XPO Logistics Europe\u2019s business and financial condition.\nXPO Logistics Europe also makes significant use of temporary staff. We cannot guarantee that temporary employees are as well-trained as our other employees. Specifically, we are exposed to the risk that temporary employees do not perform their assignments in a satisfactory manner or do not comply with our safety rules in an appropriate manner, such as due to their lack of experience, which may cause harm to goods and people. If such risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by labor disputes.\nOur business in the past has been and in the future could be adversely affected by strikes and labor renegotiations affecting seaports, labor disputes between railroads and their union employees, or by a work stoppage at one or more railroads or local trucking companies servicing rail or port terminals, including work disruptions involving owner operators under contract with our local trucking operations. Port shutdowns and similar disruptions to major points in the transportation network, most of which are beyond our control, could result in terminal embargoes, disrupt equipment and freight flows, depress volumes and revenues, increase costs and have other negative effects on our operations and financial results.\nXPO Logistics Europe\u2019s business activities require a significant amount of labor, which represents one of our main costs, and it is essential that we maintain good relations with employees, trade unions and other staff representative institutions. A deteriorating economic environment may result in tensions in industrial relations, which may lead to industrial action within our European operations that could have a direct impact on customer services. Generally, any deterioration in industrial relations could have an adverse effect on XPO Logistics Europe\u2019s revenues, earnings, financial position, and outlook.\nA significant labor dispute involving one or more of our customers, or a labor dispute that otherwise affects our operations, could reduce our revenues and harm our profitability.\nLabor disputes involving our customers could affect our operations. If our customers are unable to negotiate new labor contracts and our clients\u2019 plants experience slowdowns or closures as a result, our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. The employees of our customers, suppliers and other service providers may be, or may in the future be, unionized and there may be strikes, lock outs or material labor disputes with respect to our customers or their suppliers in the future that materially affect our performance.\nOur Logistics segment derives a substantial portion of revenue from the operation and management of operating facilities, which are often located in close proximity to a client\u2019s manufacturing plant and are integrated into the client\u2019s production line process. We may experience significant revenue loss and shut-down costs, including costs related to early termination of leases, causing our business to suffer if clients suffer strikes or other labor disputes, close their plants or significantly modify their capacity or supply chains at a plant that our Logistics segment services. In such a situation, our operations may be unable to recoup all or any of the related costs that we have incurred. Similarly, a labor dispute or plant closure involving a supplier to our Logistics segment\u2019s clients that results in a slowdown or closure of our clients\u2019 plants could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEfforts by labor organizations to organize our employees may result in reduced operational flexibility and impair our ability to quickly respond to market conditions.\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters union (the \u201cTeamsters\u201d) and certain other unions have made organizing attempts at a small number of our LTL locations in the United States. The outcomes of those efforts have generally resulted in rejection of union representation, although a very small percentage of our LTL employees have selected Teamsters representation. As of December 31, 2015, elections at only two facilities have been certified in favor of Teamsters union representation out of our nearly 280 LTL operating locations. Further unionizing efforts by the Teamsters or certain other unions are likely to continue, and we cannot predict with certainty whether that activity will result in the unionization of any additional LTL or other business unit locations. A unionized workforce domestically could potentially result in reduced operational flexibility and impair our ability to quickly respond to market conditions with innovative solutions for customers.\nWe are involved in multiple lawsuits and are subject to various claims that could result in significant expenditures and impact our operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various types of claims and litigation. In addition to the matters described in the risk factor \u201cCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations, and the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged,\u201d we are subject to claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, traffic accidents, cargo and other property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters, including with respect to claims asserted under various theories of agency and employer liability notwithstanding our independent contractor relationships with our transportation providers. Claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, or may not be covered by insurance at all. Businesses that we acquire also increase our exposure to litigation. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims, or workers\u2019 compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims, or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under indemnity provisions with transportation providers could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability.\nIn one such lawsuit, the Company is a party to a putative class action litigation (Leung v. XPO Logistics, Inc., filed in May 2015 in the U.S. District Court, Illinois) alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) related to an automated customer call system used by a last mile logistics business that the Company acquired. The Company has asserted indemnity rights pursuant the agreement by which it acquired this business, subject to certain limits. This matter is in the initial pleading stage and the court has not yet determined whether to certify the matter as a class action. The Company believes that it has adequately accrued for the potential impact of loss contingencies relating to this matter. The Company is unable at this time to estimate the amount of the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of its accrued liability that it may incur as a result of this matter.\nAn increase in the number and/or severity of self-insured claims or an increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nWe use a combination of self-insurance programs and large-deductible purchased insurance to provide for the costs of employee medical, vehicular, cargo and workers' compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-retained insurance claims reflects certain actuarial assumptions and judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. We periodically evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on targeted risk tolerance and premium expense. An increase in the number and/or severity of self-insured claims or an increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on us. We have a captive insurance company that participates in a reinsurance pool to reinsure a portion of our workers' compensation and other claims. Each company that participates in the pool cedes premiums and claims to the pool and assumes premiums and claims from the pool. The operating results of the captive insurance company are affected by the number and/or severity of claims and the associated premiums paid or received. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by the risk assumed and ceded by the captive insurance company. In addition, these captive insurance companies are subject to financial and insurance regulation by a foreign regulatory authority and changes in these applicable regulations could affect our liquidity and asset allocation with our captive insurance companies.\nWe expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and postretirement medical plans to increase due to health care reform legislation. Changes made to the design of our medical plans have the potential to mitigate some of the cost impact of the provisions included in the legislation. Ultimately, the cost of providing benefits under our medical plans is dependent on a variety of factors, including governmental laws and regulations, health care cost trends, claims experience and health care decisions by plan participants. As a result, we are unable to predict how the cost of providing benefits under medical plans will affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with defined benefit plans for our current and former employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial position.\nFollowing our acquisitions of ND and Con-way, we now maintain defined benefit pension plans and a postretirement medical plan. Our defined benefit pension plans include funded and unfunded plans in the United States and the United Kingdom. A decline in interest rates and/or lower returns on funded plan assets may cause increases in the expense and funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans and for our postretirement medical plan. Despite past amendments that froze our defined benefit pension plans to new participants and curtailed benefits, these pension plans remain subject to volatility associated with interest rates, inflation, returns on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions and statutory funding requirements. In addition to being subject to volatility associated with interest rates, our postretirement medical plan remains subject to volatility associated with actuarial assumptions and trends in healthcare costs. Any of the aforementioned factors could lead to a significant increase in the expense of these plans and a deterioration in the solvency of these plans, which could significantly increase the Company\u2019s contribution requirements. As a result, we are unable to predict the effect on our financial statements associated with our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical plan.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOn October 30, 2015, in connection with the Con-way acquisition, we entered into (1) a senior secured term loan credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), which provided for a single borrowing of $1.6 billion, and (2) the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Credit Agreement (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) that increased the commitment to $1.0 billion. Both the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility provide for an interest rate based on LIBOR or a Base Rate, as defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin. Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates since the Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility are subject to floating interest rates. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in the interest rate would increase our annual interest expense by $16.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and by $10.0 million under the ABL facility assuming that the full $1.0 billion was drawn. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAs a result of the ND and Con-way acquisitions, XPO is more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because the combined company has an increased proportion of its assets, liabilities and earnings denominated in foreign currencies as compared to XPO prior to these acquisitions.\nPrior to the ND acquisition, substantially all of XPO\u2019s operations were conducted in U.S. dollars. The ND and Con-way acquisitions significantly increased the potential impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business. As a result of the ND acquisition, the financial results of the combined company are more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of our assets, liabilities and earnings are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The Con-way acquisition also increased our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations as a portion of Con-way\u2019s historic revenues were derived outside the U.S. Despite our efforts to manage the volatility related to exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies through the use of derivative instruments, there can be no assurance that these risks are fully mitigated by our hedging program.\nWe present our financial statements in U.S. dollars but we have a significant proportion of our net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the euro and pounds sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d). Consequently, a depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on our financial results. As further discussed below under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, as of December 31, 2015, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro would have resulted in a decrease in net assets of approximately $31.1 million, and a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the GBP would have resulted in a decrease in net assets of approximately $53.9 million.\nThe economic uncertainties relating to eurozone monetary policies may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate against other currencies. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. For example, in the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or in Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business and financial condition and the business of the combined company.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy through acquisitions.\nWhile our primary focus in 2016 is on integrating our recent acquisitions, in the mid- to long-term, we may continue to expand through acquisitions to take advantage of market opportunities we perceive in our current markets (transportation and logistics) as well as new markets that we may enter. However, if we choose to make acquisitions in the future, we may experience delays or be unable to make the acquisitions we desire for a number of reasons. Suitable acquisition candidates may not be available at purchase prices that are attractive to us or on terms that are acceptable to us. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, we will compete with other companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe are unable to predict the size, timing and number of acquisitions we may complete. In addition, we may incur expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that are not completed), and we also may pay fees and expenses associated with obtaining financing for acquisitions and with investment banks and others finding acquisitions for us. Any of these amounts may be substantial, and together with the size, timing and number of acquisitions we pursue, may negatively impact us and cause significant volatility in our financial results.\nSales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may fund any future acquisitions or our capital requirements from time to time, in whole or part, through sales or issuances of our common stock or equity-based securities, subject to prevailing market conditions and our financing needs. Future equity financing will dilute the interests of our then-existing stockholders, and future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not own, and may not acquire, all of the outstanding shares of XPO Logistics Europe SA, the majority-owned subsidiary through which we conduct our European operations.\nWe currently own 86.25% of the outstanding shares of XPO Logistics Europe, the majority-owned subsidiary through which we conduct our European operations. We may not acquire the remaining shares of XPO Logistics Europe. French law only permits \u201csqueeze out\u201d mergers when a holder owns more than 95% of the outstanding shares. If we do not wholly-own XPO Logistics Europe, we will not have access to all of its cash flow to service our debt, as any dividends will be required to be declared pro rata. In addition, we will be subject to limitations on our ability to enter into transactions with XPO Logistics Europe that are not on arms-length terms, which could limit synergies that we could otherwise achieve between our North American and European operations. We also may not be able to consolidate XPO Logistics Europe for tax purposes, and XPO Logistics Europe would be forced to continue as a listed public company in France, thereby incurring certain recurring costs.\nChanges in our relationships with our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have an adverse impact on us.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated pro forma revenue for 2015. We do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations; however, collectively, some of our large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue and margins in a particular quarter or year. Our contractual relationships with customers generally are terminable at will by the customers on short notice and do not require the customer to provide any minimum commitment. Our customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand rate reductions for our services, require us to assume greater liability that increases our costs, or develop their own logistics capabilities. Failure to retain our existing customers or enter into relationships with new customers could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long-term financial forecasts.\nVolatility in fuel prices impacts our fuel surcharge revenues and may impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the availability and price of fuel, which are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control.\nWe would be adversely affected by an inability to obtain fuel in the future. Although, historically, we have been able to obtain fuel from various sources and in the desired quantities, there can be no assurance that this would continue to be the case in the future.\nFuel expense constitutes one of the greatest costs to our LTL and full truckload carrier operations, as well as to our fleet of independent contractor drivers and third-party transportation providers who complete the physical movement of freight arranged by our other business operations. Accordingly, we may be adversely affected by the timing and degree of fluctuations and volatility in fuel prices. As is customary in our industry, most of our customer contracts include fuel-surcharge revenue programs or cost-recovery mechanisms to mitigate the effect of the fuel prices increase over base amounts established in the contract. However, these fuel surcharge mechanisms may not capture the entire amount of the increase in fuel prices, and they also feature a lag between the payment for fuel and collection of the surcharge revenue. Market pressures may limit our ability to assess fuel surcharges in the future. The extent to which we are able to recover in full for fuel costs changes may also vary depending on the degree to which we are not compensated due to empty and out-of-route miles or from engine idling during cold or warm weather.\nDecreases in fuel prices reduce the cost of transportation services and accordingly, will reduce our revenues and may reduce margins for certain lines of business. Significant changes in the price or availability of fuel in future periods, or significant changes in our ability to mitigate fuel price increases through the use of fuel surcharges, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, fleet capacity and ability to generate both revenues and profits.\nOur intermodal business may be affected by any adverse change to relationships with railroad service providers upon the expiration or renewal of such contracts.\nThe rail contracts supporting our intermodal operations, which have varied expiration dates, contain specific contract rates and other negotiated provisions that enable us to provide competitive transportation rates and services to our customers. A loss of one or more of these rail contracts, or failure to enter into renewal or replacement contracts with comparably favorable terms upon expiration of the current contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. While we expect to be able to continue to obtain competitive terms and conditions from our railroad vendors, no assurance can be given that such terms and conditions will be comparable to those in our current rail contracts.\nIn addition, Union Pacific is a primary supplier and servicer of the 53-foot containers used in our business, as well as the chassis used on the Union Pacific network. We have the ability under our arrangements with Union Pacific to increase or decrease our equipment fleet periodically. The refusal or failure of Union Pacific to provide us with additional containers and chassis when required, or to allow us to return excess equipment when requested, or our failure to adequately and timely service the containers or chassis we use, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nNetwork changes, lane closures, carrier consolidation, and other reductions or deterioration in rail services could increase costs, decrease demand for our intermodal services and adversely affect our operating results.\nMost of the intermodal transportation services that we provide depend on the major railroads in the United States and Mexico, which in many markets is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad. As a result, any reduction, suspension, interruption or elimination of rail service to a particular market may limit our ability to serve some of our customers. Furthermore, reductions in service by the railroads are likely to increase the cost of the rail-based services that we provide and potentially reduce the reliability, timeliness, and overall attractiveness of our intermodal product. Increases in the cost of rail service reduce some of the advantages of intermodal transportation compared to truck and other transportation modes, which may reduce demand for our intermodal services. Rail consolidations in the past have caused service disruptions and would further reduce service choices and bargaining power for rail customers. Further consolidation among railroads might adversely affect intermodal transportation and our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, our railroad suppliers have experienced train resource shortages, operating inefficiencies, and high demand for rail transportation that resulted in increased transit times, terminal congestion, and decreased equipment velocity, all of which increase our costs, decrease equipment capacity, impact customer service, and create a challenging operating environment. To the extent that we rely on rail carriers that experience poor service performance, demand for our intermodal services may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted, and may in the future result, in write-downs of the carrying value of our assets, potentially in significant amounts, thereby reducing our net income.\nAs a result of our regular review of the carrying value of our assets, we may in the future be required to recognize impairment charges, potentially in significant amounts. Changes in business strategy, rebranding efforts, government regulations, economic\nor market conditions, or our operating performance may result in substantial impairments of intangible, fixed or other assets at any time in the future, including with respect to our acquired businesses. While such impairment charges would not impact our cash position, such charges could significantly reduce our net income.\nIssues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use both internally developed and purchased technology in conducting our business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that the user of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, any settlement or adverse judgment against us either in the form of increased costs of licensing or a cease and desist order in using the technology could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operation.\nWe also rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to establish and protect our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third-parties or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by our employees, contractors and others. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time consuming and costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources and ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.\nOur failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulation, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the United States and in foreign countries in which we operate. These regulatory agencies have authority and oversight of domestic and international transportation services and related activities, licensure, motor carrier operations, safety and security and other matters. We must comply with various insurance and surety bond requirements to act in the capacities for which we are licensed. Our subsidiaries and independent contractors must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of such agencies. Through our subsidiaries and business units, we hold various licenses required to carry out our domestic and international services. These licenses permit us to provide services as a motor carrier, property broker, indirect air carrier, OTI, NVOCC, freight forwarder, air freight forwarder, and ocean freight forwarder. We also are subject to regulations and requirements promulgated by, among others, the DOT, FMCSA, DHS, CBP, TSA, FMC, IATA, the Canada Border Services Agency and various other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. Certain of our businesses engage in the transportation of hazardous materials, which subjects us to regulations with respect to transportation of such materials and environmental regulations in the case of any accidents the occur during the transportation of materials that causes discharge of such materials. Our failure to maintain our required licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See the \u201cRegulation\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cBusiness\u201d for more information.\nFuture laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices that influence the demand for transportation services or require us to incur significant additional costs. We are unable to predict the impact that recently enacted and future regulations may have on our businesses. Higher costs incurred by us, or incurred by our independent contractors or third-party transportation providers who pass the increased costs on to us, as a result of future new regulations could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we are unable to obtain a corresponding increase in price from our customers.\nSeasonality affects our operations and profitability.\nThe transportation industry experiences seasonal fluctuations. Our results of operations are typically lower for the first quarter of the calendar year relative to our other quarters. We believe this is due in part to the post- holiday reduction in demand experienced by many of our customers, which leads to more capacity in the non-expedited and service-critical markets and, in turn, less demand for expedited and premium shipping services. In addition, the productivity of our independent contractors and transportation providers generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations.\nTerrorist attacks, anti-terrorism measures and war could have broad detrimental effects on our business operations.\nAs a result of the potential for terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to follow various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on trucking and rail routes and security screenings of air cargo on passenger aircraft and international containers. Such measures may reduce the productivity of our\nindependent contractors and transportation providers or increase the costs associated with their operations, which we could be forced to bear. War, risk of war or a terrorist attack also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war also could impact our ability to raise capital or to refinance our indebtedness. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls a large portion of our stock and has substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bradley S. Jacobs, controls, as the managing member of Jacobs Private Equity, LLC (\u201cJPE\u201d), (i) 67,500 shares of our Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, which are initially convertible into an aggregate of 9,642,857 shares of our common stock, and (ii) 9,642,857 warrants initially exercisable for an aggregate of 9,642,857 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.00 per share. Mr. Jacobs also directly owns 105,016 shares of our common stock and has employee stock options and restricted stock units convertible into an additional 545,029 shares of our common stock. Under applicable SEC rules, Mr. Jacobs beneficially owns approximately 15% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2015. This concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stockholders. Our preferred stock votes together with our common stock on an \u201cas-converted\u201d basis on all matters, except as otherwise required by law, and separately as a class with respect to certain matters implicating the rights of holders of shares of the preferred stock. Accordingly, Mr. Jacobs can exert substantial influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Additionally, significant fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders, including JPE, could impact the volume of trading, liquidity and market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90175, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "XPO"}
