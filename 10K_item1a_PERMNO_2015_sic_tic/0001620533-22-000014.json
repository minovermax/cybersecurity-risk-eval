Risk Factors.\nDescribed below are risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our Class A common stock. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to the following:\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategies and Operations\n\u25aaPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our business, and have materially affected our business, results of operations and our financial condition.\n\u25aaOur long-term success is dependent on the selection, design and execution of appropriate business strategies.\n\u25aaOur primary growth strategy is highly dependent on the availability of suitable locations and our ability to develop and open new Shacks on a timely basis and on terms attractive to us.\n\u25aaOur plans to open new Shacks, the ongoing need for capital expenditures at our existing Shacks and our ongoing digital enhancements require us to spend capital.\n\u25aaOur expansion into new domestic markets may present increased risks, which could affect our profitability.\n\u25aaOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\n\u25aaNew Shacks, once opened, may not be profitable, and may negatively affect Shack sales at our existing Shacks.\n\u25aaIf we are unable to maintain and grow Shack sales at our existing Shacks, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\u25aaOur mission to Stand For Something Good subjects us to risks.\n\u25aaWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major products and rely on one national distribution company for the majority of our domestic distribution needs. If our suppliers or distributor are unable to fulfill their obligations under our arrangements with them, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs.\n\u25aaOur marketing strategies and channels will evolve and our programs may or may not be successful.\n\u25aaWe rely on a limited number of licensees for the operation of our licensed Shacks, and we have limited control with respect to the operations of our licensed Shacks, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\n\u25aaIf we fail to maintain our corporate culture, our relationships with our team members and guests could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry\n\u2022Incidents involving food safety and food-borne illnesses could adversely affect guests' perception of our brand, result in lower sales and increase operating costs.\n\u2022The digital and delivery business, related expenses, execution and expansion thereof, is uncertain and subject to risk.\n\u2022Rising labor costs and difficulties recruiting and retaining the right team members could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Increased food commodity and energy costs could decrease our Shack-level operating profit margins or cause us to limit or otherwise modify our menu, which could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food products could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022We face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Inflationary environment poses a new risk to broader demand for restaurants, including ours.\n\u2022The increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could increase our costs, harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022Our international licensed Shacks import many of our proprietary and other core ingredients from the United States and the United Kingdom. If this international supply chain is interrupted, our international licensed operations could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs.\n\u2022We are subject to risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 20\n\u2022Restaurant companies have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings that are costly, divert management attention and, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial damages or settlement costs.\n\u2022Our business is subject to risks related to our sale of alcoholic beverages.\nGeneral Business and Economic Risks\n\u2022Damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Changes in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Because many of our domestic Company-operated Shacks are concentrated in local or regional areas, we are susceptible to economic and other trends and developments, including adverse weather conditions, in these areas.\n\u2022Security breaches of either confidential guest information in connection with, among other things, our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions, kiosk ordering or mobile ordering app, or confidential team member information may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022If we are unable to maintain and update our information technology systems to meet the needs of our business, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022If we experience a material failure or interruption in our systems, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022Because a component of our strategy is to continue to grow our licensed business internationally, the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\n\u2022We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We depend on key members of our executive management team.\n\u2022Our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\n\u2022We are subject to many federal, state and local laws, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, with which compliance is both costly and complex. Failure to comply with, or changes in these laws or requirements, could have an adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\n\u2022Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial information or comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\n\u2022Shake Shack has non-controlling interest holders, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\n\u2022Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the non-controlling interest holders that will not benefit Class A common stockholders to the same extent as it will benefit the non-controlling interest holders.\n\u2022The non-controlling interest holders have the right to have their LLC Interests redeemed or exchanged into shares of Class A common stock, which may cause volatility in our stock price.\n\u2022We will continue to incur relatively outsized costs as a result of becoming a public company and in the administration of our complex organizational structure.\n\u2022Our anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of our Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\n\u2022The provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\n\u2022We do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.\nRisks Related to Our Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\")\n\u2022We are a holding company and our principal asset is our interest in SSE Holdings, and, accordingly, we will depend on distributions from SSE Holdings to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the TRA. SSE Holdings' ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\n\u2022In certain cases, payments under the TRA to the non-controlling interest holders may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.\n\u2022We will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the non-controlling interest holders under the TRA in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 21\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Notes\n\u2022Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\n\u2022The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022Conversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our Class A common stock.\n\u2022Certain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES AND OPERATIONS\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our business, and have materially affected our operations, results of operations and our financial condition.\nCOVID-19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.The outbreak of the virus has continued to impact the United States and the global economy, resulting in varying levels of restrictions and shutdowns implemented by international, national, state, and local authorities. In response to the outbreak, in March 2020, we closed all dining rooms and temporarily shifted to a \u201cto-go\u201d only operating model in our domestic Company-operated Shacks. With a prioritization on health and safety, we have re-opened dining rooms, where permitted, under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving guest behaviors and expectations.\nViruses such as COVID-19 may be transmitted through human contact and airborne delivery, and the risk of contracting viruses could continue to cause team members or guests to avoid gathering in public places. Additionally, government authorities have imposed and may continue to impose vaccine or testing mandates, mandatory closures, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, human interactions and restaurant operations which have impacted our ability to offer all sales channels at all Shacks. These restrictions have had, and may continue to have, adverse effects on our guest traffic and the ability to adequately staff our Shacks.\nThroughout the pandemic, state and local governments in the U.S. and throughout the world have alternated between removing and easing certain restrictions on the one hand, and reintroducing restrictions on businesses, including restaurants, on the other hand, depending on the severity of local or regional outbreaks. Additionally, different jurisdictions have seen varying levels of outbreaks or resurgences in outbreaks, and corresponding differences in government responses, which has made it, and may continue to make it, difficult for us to plan or forecast an appropriate response. For example, a material portion of our licensed revenue comes from Asia, a region which has seen more severe restrictions lately from rising COVID-19 cases than the United States. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or the ongoing response from governing authorities, the pandemic and the response to the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and such impact has been, and is expected to continue to be, material to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe significance of the operational and financial impact on us will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions caused by COVID-19, and the corresponding response to contain the virus and treat those affected by it prove to be. Further uncertain or changing economic and market conditions, including prolonged periods of high unemployment, staffing issues, inflation, deflation or prolonged weak consumer demand or a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, or political or other changes resulting from the pandemic or other factors would continue to impact our business, sales and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our ability to execute our growth plans, including delays in construction of new Shacks, delays in our digital initiatives and adverse impacts to our overall ability to successfully enter into new markets.\nOur operations have been further disrupted when team members contract or have been exposed to COVID-19 or other illnesses, since this has required us or our business partners to quarantine some or all such employees and disinfect our impacted restaurant facilities. In some cases, we are required by local and state regulations to report team members who have contracted or been exposed to the virus. If a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our business partners are unable to work due to reasons including illness or travel restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 22\nmay be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur long-term success is dependent on the selection, design and execution of appropriate business strategies.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and ever-changing environment. Our long-term success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate business strategies within this environment. Our current strategies include:\n\u25aaEnhancing our omnichannel guest experience. This will occur through the accelerated innovation of new digital tools (e.g., new digitally-enabled ordering experiences, the introduction of a new digital payments platform, our recently upgraded website, and in-app delivery) and the continued integration of our data platforms enabling segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.\n\u25aaGlobal unit expansion and the expansion of Shack formats to incorporate increased convenience and frequency. This will include the pursuit of top-tier real estate in both urban and suburban markets that can incorporate diverse formats, including new Shack Track and drive-thru formats, as well as our focus on increasing our licensed Shack presence, both domestically and abroad, particularly in China.\n\u25aaMenu innovation, with a focus on LTOs, collaborations and the expansion of existing menu categories including expanding the options for premium add-ons.\nWe may experience challenges in achieving the goals we have set and we may be unsuccessful in executing on our strategies once identified. Conversely, we may also execute on poorly designed strategies that prove to be ineffective or require us to make substantial changes to our strategy in order to produce the desired results. Our strategies may expose us to additional risks, and strategies that have been successful for us in the past may fail to be so in the future. We may incur significant costs and damage our brand if we are unable to identify, develop and execute on appropriate business strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary growth strategy is highly dependent on the availability of suitable locations and our ability to develop and open new Shacks on a timely basis and on terms attractive to us.\nOne of the key means of achieving our growth strategies will be through opening and operating new Shacks on a profitable basis for the foreseeable future. We must identify target markets where we can enter or expand, taking into account numerous factors such as the location of our current Shacks, the target consumer base, population density, demographics, traffic patterns, competition, geography and information gathered from our various contacts. We may not be able to open our planned new Shacks within budget or on a timely basis, if at all, given the uncertainty of these factors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we operate more Shacks, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our Shack base will eventually decline.\nThe number and timing of new Shacks opened during any given period may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including:\n\u25aaidentification and availability of attractive sites for new Shacks;\n\u25aadifficulty negotiating suitable lease terms;\n\u25aashortages of construction labor or materials;\n\u25aarecruitment and training of qualified personnel in the local market;\n\u25aaour ability to obtain all required governmental permits, including zonal approvals;\n\u25aaour ability to control construction and development costs of new Shacks;\n\u25aacompetition in new markets, including competition for appropriate sites;\n\u25aafailure of the landlords to timely deliver real estate to us and other landlord delays;\n\u25aaproximity of potential sites to an existing Shack, and the impact of cannibalization on future growth;\n\u25aaanticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new Shacks;\n\u25aacost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening costs; and\n\u25aaCOVID-19 related factors such as longer permitting cycles and availability of construction and restaurant equipment and services.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 23\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand as we may not correctly analyze the suitability of a location or anticipate all of the challenges imposed by expanding our operations. Our growth strategy, and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new domestic Company-operated Shack, may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits. In addition, as has happened when other restaurant concepts have tried to expand, we may find that our concept has limited appeal in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of our concept in the markets in which we operate. If we are unable to expand in existing markets or penetrate new markets, our ability to increase our revenues and profitability may be materially harmed or we may face losses.\nOur plans to open new Shacks, the ongoing need for capital expenditures at our existing Shacks and our ongoing digital enhancements require us to spend capital.\nOur growth strategy depends on opening new Shacks and innovation of new digital tools, which will require us to use cash flows from operations. We cannot assure that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to allow us to implement our growth strategy. If these funds are not allocated efficiently among our various projects, or if any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, we may experience reduced profitability and we could be required to delay a project or delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned Shack openings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as our Shacks and digital infrastructure mature, our business will require maintenance, investment, renovation and improvement expenditures to remain competitive and maintain the value of our brand standard. This creates an ongoing need for cash, and, to the extent we cannot fund capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, funds will need to be borrowed or otherwise obtained.\nIf the costs of funding new Shacks or renovations or enhancements to existing Shacks exceed budgeted amounts, and/or the time for building or renovation is longer than anticipated, our profits could be reduced. Additionally, recent inflation of material and labor costs in addition to our new, larger drive-thru formats have resulted in higher construction costs. If we cannot access the capital we need, we may not be able to execute our growth strategy, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur expansion into new domestic markets may present increased risks, which could affect our profitability.\nWe plan to open domestic Company-operated Shacks in markets where we have little or no operating experience. Shacks we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected Shack sales and profit levels on a consistent basis, may be less profitable on average than our current base of Shacks and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than Shacks we open in existing markets. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets to build brand awareness. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and retain qualified team members who share our values. We may also incur higher costs from entering new markets if, for example, we assign area directors to manage comparatively fewer Shacks than we assign in more developed markets. Also, until we attain a critical mass in a market, the Shacks we do open may incur higher food distribution costs and reduced operating leverage. As a result, these new Shacks may be less successful or may achieve target Shack-level operating profit margins at a slower rate, if ever. If we do not successfully execute our plans to enter new markets, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our international presence, which can pose similar and additional challenges in opening new Shacks.\nOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur growth plan includes opening a large number of new Shacks. Our existing personnel, management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to locate, hire, train and retain management and operating personnel, particularly in new markets. We may not be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure, or be able to hire or retain the necessary management and operating personnel, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. These demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 24\na deterioration in the financial performance of our existing Shacks. If we experience a decline in financial performance, we may decrease the number of or discontinue Shack openings, or we may decide to close Shacks that we are unable to operate in a profitable manner.\nNew Shacks, once opened, may not be profitable, and may negatively affect Shack sales at our existing Shacks.\nOur results have been, and in the future may continue to be, significantly impacted by the timing of new Shack openings (often dictated by factors outside of our control), including landlord delays, associated Shack pre-opening costs and operating inefficiencies, as well as changes in our geographic concentration due to the opening of new Shacks. We typically incur the most significant portion of pre-opening costs associated with a given Shack within the several months preceding the opening of the Shack. Our experience has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened Shack for the first several months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of Shack sales. Our new Shacks take a period of time to reach target operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new Shacks, including the training of new personnel, new market learning curves, inability to hire sufficient qualified staff and other factors. We may incur additional costs in new markets, particularly for transportation and distribution, which may impact the profitability of those Shacks. Although we have specific target operating and financial metrics, new Shacks may not meet these targets or may take longer than anticipated to do so. Any new Shacks we open may not be profitable or achieve operating results similar to those of our existing Shacks, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe opening of a new Shack in or near markets in which we already have Shacks could adversely affect the Shack sales of those existing Shacks. Existing Shacks could also make it more difficult to build our consumer base for a new Shack in the same market. We will continue to cluster in select markets and open new Shacks in and around areas of existing Shacks that are operating at or near capacity to leverage operational efficiencies and effectively serve our guests. Cannibalization of Shack sales among our Shacks may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could adversely affect our Shack sales growth, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, many of our current domestic Company-operated Shacks are located in high volume urban markets. As we expand, the number of domestic Company-operated Shacks located in high volume urban markets will decrease relative to the system-wide Shack portfolio and as a result we do not expect to maintain our current average unit volumes (\"AUVs\") and Shack-level operating profit margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain and grow Shack sales at our existing Shacks, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nThe level of same-Shack sales growth, which represents the change in year-over-year revenues for domestic Company-operated Shacks open for 24 full months or longer, could affect our Shack sales growth. Our ability to increase same-Shack sales depends, in part, on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to build Shack sales. It is possible such initiatives will not be successful, that we will not achieve our target same-Shack sales growth or that same-Shack sales growth could be negative, which may cause a decrease in Shack sales and profit growth that would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mission to Stand For Something Good subjects us to risks.\nOur mission to Stand For Something Good is a significant part of our business strategy and who we are as a Company. It's our commitment to all that is good in the world and is a reflection of how we embrace our values both internally and externally. We pride ourselves on sourcing premium ingredients from like-minded producers - all-natural proteins, vegetarian fed, humanely raised and source verified, with no added hormones or antibiotics. We are dedicated to using sustainable materials and equipment whenever possible, and distinctive furniture and fixtures that advance our sustainability and diversity initiatives, as well as being committed to achieving ethical and humane practices for the animals in our supply chain. We also strive to be the best employer and a good citizen in each community we call home.\nWe do, however, face many challenges in carrying out our mission to Stand For Something Good. We incur higher costs and other risks associated with paying above-average wages to our team members and purchasing high quality ingredients grown or\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 25\nraised with an emphasis on quality and responsible practices. As a result, our food and labor costs may be significantly higher than other companies who do not source high quality ingredients or pay above minimum wage. Additionally, the supply for high quality ingredients may be limited and it may take us longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our quality standards and have sufficient quantities to support our growing business. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply for our ingredients on a cost-effective basis, our food costs could increase or we may experience supply interruptions which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins. Additionally, some of our competitors have announced initiatives to offer better quality ingredients, such as antibiotic-free and fresh meat. If this trend continues, it could further limit our supply for certain ingredients and we may lose our competitive advantage as it will be more difficult to differentiate ourselves.\nBecause we hold ourselves to such high standards, and because we believe our guests have come to have high expectations of us, we may be more severely affected by negative reports or publicity if we fail, or are believed to have failed, to comply with our own standards. The damage to our reputation may be greater than other companies that do not have similar values as us, and it may take us longer to recover from such an incident and gain back the trust of our guests. Our mission to Stand For Something Good also exposes us to criticism from special interest groups who have different opinions regarding certain food issues or who believe we should pursue different strategies and goals. Any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely affect customer traffic.\nWe believe that our Stand For Something Good philosophy has been a major contributing factor in our past success because we believe consumers are increasingly focused on where their food comes from and how it is made, and that consumers want to associate themselves with brands whose ethos matches that of their own. However, if these trends change we may no longer be able to successfully compete with other restaurants who share different values than us.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major products and rely on one national distribution company for the majority of our domestic distribution needs. If our suppliers or distributor are unable to fulfill their obligations under our arrangements with them, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major ingredients, including beef patties, chicken, potato buns, custard, portobello mushrooms and cheese sauce. In fiscal 2021, we purchased all of our (i) ground beef patties from nine of our ten approved beef processors, with approximately 41% of our ground beef patties supplied from one supplier; (ii) chicken breasts from one supplier; (iii) potato buns from one supplier; (iv) custard base from two suppliers; (v) 'Shroom Burgers from one supplier; (vi) crinkle cut fries from two suppliers; and (vii) ShackSauce from one supplier. Due to this concentration of suppliers, the cancellation of our supply arrangements with any one of these suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability of these suppliers to deliver these major products to our Shacks may materially and adversely affect our results of operations while we establish alternate distribution channels. In addition, if our suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. We cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms or a timely basis, if at all.\nWe contract with one distributor, which we refer to as our \"broadline\" distributor, to provide virtually all of our food distribution services in the United States. As of December 29, 2021, approximately 81% of certain food and beverage ingredients, including chicken, fries and custard, collectively representing 45% of our purchases, were processed through our broadline distributor for distribution and delivery to each Shack. As of December 29, 2021, we utilized 20 affiliated distribution centers and each distribution center carries two to three weeks of inventory for our core ingredients. In the event of a catastrophe, such as a fire, our broadline distributor can supply the Shacks affected by their respective distribution center from another affiliated distribution center. If a catastrophe, such as a fire, were to occur at the distribution center that services the Shacks located in New York and northern New Jersey, we would be at immediate risk of product shortages because that distribution center supplies 21% of our domestic Company-operated Shacks as of December 29, 2021, which collectively represented 25% of our Shack sales for fiscal 2021. The other 19 distribution centers collectively supply the other approximately 79% of our domestic Company-operated Shacks, which represented the remaining 75% of our Shack sales.\nAlthough we believe that alternative supply and distribution sources are available, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to identify or negotiate with such sources on terms that are commercially reasonable to us. If our suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts or we are unable to identify alternative sources, we could\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 26\nencounter supply shortages and incur higher costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur marketing strategies and channels will evolve and our programs may or may not be successful.\nShake Shack is a growing brand, and we incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts to attract and retain guests. Our strategy includes public relations, digital and social media, promotions and in-store messaging, which require less marketing spend as compared to traditional marketing programs. As the number of Shacks increases, and as we expand into new markets, we expect to increase our investment in advertising and promotional activities, including targeted marketing offers to unique guest segments and incentivizing and rewarding loyal guests. Accordingly, in the future, we will incur greater marketing expenditures, resulting in greater financial risk and a greater impact on our financial results.\nWe rely heavily on social media for many of our marketing efforts. If consumer sentiment towards social media changes or a new medium of communication becomes more mainstream, we may be required to fundamentally change our current marketing strategies which could require us to incur significantly more costs.\nSome of our marketing initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to spend significantly more on marketing and advertising than we are able to at this time. Should our competitors increase spending on marketing and advertising or our marketing funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising and promotions be less effective than those of our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we face additional expenses as it relates to our digital business which can vary over time and may impact our overall profitability.\nWe rely on a limited number of licensees for the operation of our licensed Shacks, and we have limited control with respect to the operations of our licensed Shacks, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nWe rely, in part, on our licensees and the manner in which they operate their Shacks to develop and promote our business. As of December 29, 2021, nine licensees operated all of our domestic licensed Shacks and six licensees operated all of our international licensed Shacks, with one such licensee operating 44% of our international licensed Shacks. Our licensees are required to operate their Shacks according to the specific guidelines we set forth, which are essential to maintaining brand integrity and reputation, all laws and regulations applicable to Shake Shack and its subsidiaries, and all laws and regulations applicable in the countries in which Shake Shack operates. We provide training to these licensees to integrate them into our operating strategy and culture. However, since we do not have day-to-day control over all of these Shacks, we cannot give assurance that there will not be differences in product and service quality, operations, labor law enforcement, marketing or that there will be adherence to all of our guidelines and applicable laws at these Shacks. In addition, if our licensees fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their Shacks, guest preference for the Shake Shack brand could suffer. Failure of these Shacks to operate effectively could adversely affect our cash flows from those operations or have a negative impact on our reputation or our business.\nThe success of our licensed operations depends on our ability to establish and maintain good relationships with our licensees. The value of our brand and the rapport that we maintain with our licensees are important factors for potential licensees considering doing business with us. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with licensees, we may be unable to renew license agreements and opportunities for developing new relationships with additional licensees may be adversely affected. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective developers and licensees, we cannot be certain that the developers and licensees we select will have the business acumen necessary to open and operate successful licensed Shacks in their licensing areas. Our licensees compete for guests with other restaurants in their geographic markets, and the ability of our licensees to compete for guests directly impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the desirability of our brand to prospective licensees. Licensees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open the Shacks contemplated by their agreements with us or to be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them, or they may elect to cease development for other reasons. Licensees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or\nShake Shack Inc.

Additionally, financing from banks and other financial institutions may not always be available to licensees to construct and open new Shacks. Any of these problems could slow our growth from licensing operations and reduce our licensing revenues.\nIf we fail to maintain our corporate culture, our relationships with our team members and guests could be negatively affected.\nWe take great pride in our culture and believe that it is an extremely important factor in our success. We believe that our culture of Enlightened Hospitality and our mission to Stand For Something Good creates a truly differentiated experience for our guests and is one of the reasons guests choose to dine with us and team members choose us as a place of employment. If we are unable to maintain our culture, especially as we continue to rapidly grow and expand in new markets, our reputation may be damaged, we may lose the trust of our guests, team member morale may be diminished and we may experience difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified team members. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATING IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY\nIncidents involving food safety and food-borne illnesses could adversely affect guests' perception of our brand, result in lower sales and increase operating costs.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve. Nevertheless, we face food safety risks, including the risk of food-borne illness and food contamination, which are common both in the restaurant industry and the food supply chain and cannot be completely eliminated. We rely on third-party food suppliers and distributors to properly handle, store and transport our ingredients to our Shacks. Any failure by our suppliers, or their suppliers, could cause our ingredients to be contaminated, which may be difficult to detect before the food is served. Additionally, the risk of food-borne illness may also increase whenever our food is served outside of our control, such as by third-party delivery services. We are further exposed to this risk from our sales through unaffiliated third-party delivery services, as well as through any third-party delivery partners we use.\nRegardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues, whether or not accurate, at one or more of our Shacks, including Shacks operated by our licensees, could adversely affect our brand and reputation, which in turn could result in reduced guest traffic and lower sales. Additionally, we believe that, because our mission to Stand For Something Good promotes the use of higher quality ingredients, our guests have high expectations of us and we could be more severely affected by incidents of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues than some of our competitors who do not promote such standards. We may also have a more difficult time recovering from a food-borne illness incident and may be required to incur significant costs to repair our reputation.\nIf any of our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close one or more Shacks or choose to close as a preventative measure if we suspect there was a pathogen in our Shacks. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our Shacks, could subject us or our suppliers to voluntary or involuntary food recalls and the costs to conduct such recalls could be significant and could interrupt our supply to unaffected Shacks or increase the cost of our ingredients.\nAdditionally, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef, our key ingredient. For example, if a pathogen, such as \"mad cow disease,\" or other virus, bacteria, parasite or toxin infects the food supply (or is believed to have infected the food supply), regardless of whether our supply chain is affected, guests may actively avoid consuming certain ingredients. A negative report or negative publicity surrounding such an incident, whether related to one of our Shacks or to a competitor in the industry, may have an adverse impact on demand for our food and could result in a material decrease in guest traffic and lower sales.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 28\nThe digital and delivery business, related expenses, execution and expansion thereof, is uncertain and subject to risk.\nDigital innovation and growth remains a key focus for us. We continue to execute upon our digital strategy, including the enhancement of our omnichannel guest experience through the accelerated innovation of new digital tools, and the continued integration of our data platforms enabling segmentation and targeted marketing strategies. Furthermore, in fiscal 2020 we expanded our reach with third-party delivery partners, and in September 2021, we began offering delivery through the Shake Shack website. Delivery will be across all our native digital platforms with the anticipated launch of the new Android experience in early 2022. We believe these digital investments to be a critical differentiator for our business, creating the opportunity to drive greater engagement and frequency with both new and existing guests. As the digital space around us continues to evolve, our technology needs to evolve concurrently to stay competitive with the industry. If we do not maintain and innovate our digital systems that are competitive with the industry, and as we face execution risks around upgrades of existing and new digital platforms, our digital business may be adversely affected and could damage our sales as well as profitability. We rely on third-parties for our ordering and payment platforms relating to our mobile app and kiosks. Such services performed by these third-parties could be damaged or interrupted by technological issues, which could then result in a loss of sales for a period of time. We also could see higher costs from our digital partners which we may not be able to fully offset by price. Information processed by these third-parties could also be impacted by cyber-attacks, which could not only negatively impact our sales, but also harm our brand image.\nRecognizing the rise in delivery services offered throughout the restaurant industry, we understand the importance of providing such services to meet our guests wherever and whenever they want. We have invested in marketing to promote our delivery partnerships, which could negatively impact our profitability if the business does not continue to expand. We rely on third-parties to fulfill delivery orders timely and in a fashion that will satisfy our guests. Errors in providing adequate delivery services may result in guest dissatisfaction, which could also result in loss of guest retention, loss in sales and damage to our brand image. Additionally, as with any third-party handling food, such delivery services increase the risk of food tampering while in transit. We developed sealed packaging to provide some deterrence against such potential food tampering. We are also subject to risk if there is a shortage of delivery drivers, which could result in a failure to meet our guests' expectations.\nThird-party delivery services within the restaurant industry is a competitive environment and includes a number of players competing for market share. If our third-party delivery partners fail to effectively compete with other third-party delivery providers in the sector, our delivery business may suffer resulting in a loss of sales. If any third-party delivery provider we partner with experiences damage to their brand image, we may also see ramifications due to our partnership with them. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources to spend on marketing and advertising around their digital and delivery campaigns than we are able to at this time. Should our competitors increase their spend in these areas, or if our advertising and promotions be less effective than our competitors, there could be an adverse impact on our business in this space. Third-party delivery services within the restaurant industry typically charge restaurants a fee per order. We currently have contracts with our major delivery service providers for a fixed period of time. However, there is uncertainty as to how these fees will evolve. In 2021, we implemented menu price inflation on our third-party delivery platforms to help offset a portion of this fee; the higher menu prices could result in loss of sales. As delivery, as well as the partnerships we have made in connection with delivery, is still a growing business for us, it is difficult for us to anticipate its impact to our sales as well as the challenges we may face in the future.\nRising labor costs and difficulties recruiting and retaining the right team members could adversely affect our business.\nAs our culture remains an important factor to our success, it in part depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified managers and team members to meet the needs of our existing Shacks and to staff new Shacks. We aim to hire talented people who have integrity, who are warm, motivated, self-aware, intellectually curious, and possess the competencies and skills to continue to foster our growth. We value people who are excited and committed to high performance, remarkable and enriching hospitality, embodying our culture, and actively growing themselves and the brand.\nIn many markets, competition for qualified individuals is intense and we may be unable to identify and attract a sufficient number of individuals to meet our growing needs, especially in markets where our brand is less established. As a result, because we aim to hire the best people, we may be required to pay higher wages and provide greater benefits. Our commitment to taking care of our team may cause us to incur higher labor costs compared to other restaurant companies. Additionally, several states in which we operate have enacted minimum wage increases and it is possible that other states or the federal government could also\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 29\nenact minimum wage increases, scheduling and benefit changes, increased health care and workers' compensation insurance costs and benefits and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such increases have and may continue to cause an increase to our labor and related expenses and cause our Shack-level operating profit margins to decline. In the event there are additional minimum wage increases, increases in employee turnover or other legislation related to employee benefits are enacted or changed, such as the Affordable Care Act, we may be required to implement additional pay increases or provide additional benefits in the future in order to continue to attract and retain the most qualified people, which may put further pressure on our operating margins by increasing costs. Overall, we expect wages at all levels to continue to increase in the near and short term and we expect these rising wages to add pressure to our operating profit.\nWe place a heavy emphasis on the qualification and training of our team members and spend a significant amount of time and money training our team members. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may result in higher turnover and increased labor costs, and could compromise the quality of our service, all of which could adversely affect our business. Any such inability could also delay the planned openings of new Shacks and could adversely impact our existing Shacks. Such increased costs of attracting qualified team members or delays in Shack openings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased food commodity and energy costs could decrease our Shack-level operating profit margins or cause us to limit or otherwise modify our menu, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur profitability depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including among other things beef, poultry, grains, dairy and produce. Prices may be affected due to market changes, increased competition, the general risk of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply due to weather, disease or other conditions beyond our control, or other reasons. For example, in previous years, there were recalls for romaine lettuce, and although we do not serve romaine lettuce, we nonetheless experienced a slight financial impact due to higher demand and price of other types of lettuce we do serve on our burgers and sandwiches. Similarly, beef supply shortages, largely caused by plant shut downs due to COVID-19 and lack of labor at processing facilities resulted in significant inflation in beef compared to fiscal 2019. Other events could increase commodity prices or cause shortages that could affect the cost and quality of the items we buy or require us to further raise prices or limit our menu items. Furthermore, increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including any changes associated with global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients. These events, combined with other more general economic and demographic conditions, could impact our pricing and negatively affect our Shack sales and Shack-level operating profit margins. While we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of core operating resources by gradually increasing menu prices, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our guests without any resulting change to their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate same-Shack sales growth in an amount sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures.\nWe may decide to enter into certain forward pricing arrangements with our suppliers, which could result in fixed or formula-based pricing with respect to certain food products. However, these arrangements generally are relatively short in duration and may provide only limited protection from price changes. In addition, the use of these arrangements may limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements.\nOur profitability is also adversely affected by increases in the price of utilities, such as natural gas, electric and water, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise. Our ability to respond to increased costs by increasing prices or by implementing alternative processes or products will depend on our ability to anticipate and react to such increases and other more general economic and demographic conditions, as well as the responses of our competitors and guests. All of these things may be difficult to predict and beyond our control. In this manner, increased costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 30\nAdditionally, with elevated inflationary pressures across the business, we face an above average risk that we will have to renegotiate contracts and agreements with suppliers on a more frequent basis. Shortened windows of certainty can impact our ability to plan our business from a supply and profitability perspective and we face greater risk of margin volatility.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food products could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our exact specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by problems in production or distribution, inclement weather, unanticipated demand or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur burgers depend on the availability of our proprietary ground beef blend. Availability of our blend depends on two different components: raw material supplied by the slaughterhouses and ground and formed beef patties supplied by regional grinders who further process and convert whole muscle purchased from the slaughterhouses. The primary risk we face is with our regional grinders. If there is an interruption of operation at any one of our regional grinder's facilities, we face an immediate risk because each Shack typically has less than three days of beef patty inventory on hand. However, we have agreements with our regional grinders to provide an alternate back-up supply in the event of a disruption in their operations. In addition, our second largest regional grinder can, in an emergency, supply us in the event of a disruption of operations at one of our beef grinders through our broadline distributor's network, but there would be a delay in availability due to production and shipping.\nWe currently have eight approved raw beef suppliers and ten approved beef processors in the United States. If there is a supply issue with all U.S. raw beef, we have seven approved raw beef suppliers and eight approved beef processors in other countries. The risks to using international suppliers are shipping lead time, shipping costs, potential import duties and U.S. customs. It is unknown at this time how long it would take and at what cost the raw material would be to import from any such other country, but the delay and cost would likely be adverse to our business.\nWe face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with many well-established companies that compete directly and indirectly with us with respect to taste, price, food quality, service, value, design and location. We compete in the restaurant industry with multi-unit national, regional and locally-owned and/or operated limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants. We compete with (i) restaurants, (ii) other fast casual restaurants, (iii) quick service restaurants and (iv) casual dining restaurants. Our competitors may operate company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants or some combination. Many of our competitors offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. We may also compete with companies outside of the traditional restaurant industry, such as grocery store chains, meal subscription services and delicatessens, especially those that target customers who seek high-quality food, as well as convenience food stores, cafeterias and other dining outlets. Many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence, better locations and greater name recognition nationally or in some of the local markets in which we operate or plan to open Shacks. Some of our competitors may also have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. They may also operate more restaurants than we do and be able to take advantage of greater economies of scale than we can given our current size.\nOur competition continues to intensify as new competitors enter the burger, fast casual, quick service and casual dining segments. Many of our competitors emphasize low cost \"value meal\" menu items or other programs that provide price discounts on their menu items, a strategy we do not pursue. We also face increasing competitive pressures from some of our competitors who have announced initiatives to offer better quality ingredients, such as antibiotic-free meat.\nChanges in consumer tastes, nutritional and dietary trends, traffic patterns and the type, number, and location of competing restaurants often affect the restaurant business. Our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns, including preferences regarding items such as calories, sodium, carbohydrates or fat. Our competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to these changes than we can. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to adapt our menu items to trends in eating habits.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 31\nAdditionally, as we continue to innovate upon our digital strategy and offer more ways to reach our guests through digital channels, such as the app, web ordering, kiosk and delivery, and new Shack Track formats, we compete with other competitors who currently, or are beginning to, offer the same options as well as new and improved technologies. With the introduction of these digital channels, there is also an increased opportunity for customer credit card fraud to occur, which could result in increased credit card fees for us.\nOur continued success depends, in part, on the continued popularity of our menu and the experience we offer guests at our Shacks. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively on any of the factors mentioned above, our traffic, Shack sales and Shack-level operating profit margins could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nInflationary environment poses a new risk to broader demand for restaurants, including ours.\nOur continued success depends on our guest ability and willingness to pay for rising menu prices across our channels. The restaurant industry broadly has faced wide-spread inflation over the past year, and is likely to continue to face inflationary pressures for the foreseeable future. In a bid to help offset these additional cost pressures, many restaurants have raised menu prices as well as charging a premium price through third-party delivery channels. As of December 2021, the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported 6% year-on-year inflation in all Food Away From Home, and 8% in Limited-Service Restaurants.\nShake Shack as a young and growing brand, has historically been conservative on price, typically raising price by 1%-2% a year. However, we implemented a 3.0% to 3.5% menu price increase in October 2021, inclusive of a 10% premium menu price on third party delivery platforms to partially offset the current above average inflationary pressures across the business. We anticipate additional price increases in 2022 beyond the normal pricing pattern as inflationary pressures warrant. However, there is risk that consumer demand suffers as a result of our more aggressive price increases.\nThe increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could increase our costs, harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results.\nThere has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on a variety of environmental, social and other sustainability matters. With respect to the restaurant industry, concerns have been expressed regarding energy management, water management, food and packaging waste management, food safety, nutritional content, labor practices and supply chain and management food sourcing. We experience pressure to make commitments relating to sustainability matters that affect companies in our industry, including the design and implementation of specific risk mitigation strategic initiatives relating to sustainability. If we are not effective in addressing environmental, social and other sustainability matters affecting our industry, or setting and meeting relevant sustainability goals, our brand image may suffer. In addition, we may experience increased costs in order to execute upon our sustainability goals and measure achievement of those goals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international licensed Shacks import many of our proprietary and other core ingredients from the United States and other countries. If this international supply chain is interrupted, our international licensed operations could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs.\nOur international licensed Shacks import many of our proprietary ingredients from the United States as well as other countries. For example, our proprietary blend of beef patties and/or raw materials for beef patties primarily originate from the United States, Australia and Uruguay and our mushrooms originate from the United States and United Kingdom. We have worked to expand our international supply chain with secondary suppliers for various key ingredients across Turkey, Japan, South Korea and China. While we have established secondary supply solutions for some of these ingredients, we have not acquired secondary suppliers for all of them. Most of our suppliers around the world have experienced difficulties and delays in acquiring ingredients to make our products.\nDue to the increasingly long lead time and general volatility in the supply chain and global ocean freight disruptions, the third-party logistic providers for our international licensed Shacks carry at least three months of inventory to allow for delays or interruptions in the supply chain. Specifically, we have had past and ongoing issues ensuring that timely and adequate supplies\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 32\nreach our international licensed Shacks. Our licensees delegate the supply function to their internal or third-party logistics providers in each country in which they operate, with which we have limited and restricted communication, preventing us from exercising direct control or instruction over such entities.\nIf our international licensed Shacks are unable to obtain our proprietary ingredients in the necessary amounts in a timely fashion as a result of logistics issues, sanctions or other challenges, it could harm its business and adversely affect the licensing revenue we receive, adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nWe do not own any real property and all of our domestic Company-operated Shacks are located on leased premises. The leases for our Shacks generally have initial terms ranging from 10 to 15 years and typically include two five-year renewal options. However, the license agreement for our Madison Square Park Shack can be terminated by the New York City Commissioner of Parks for any reason on 25 days' written notice.\nGenerally, our leases are net leases that require us to pay our share of the costs of real estate taxes, utilities, building operating expenses, insurance and other charges in addition to rent. We generally cannot cancel these leases. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. If we close a Shack, we may still be obligated to perform our monetary obligations under the applicable lease, including, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close Shacks in desirable locations. We depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings or other sources, we may not be able to service our lease obligations or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would materially affect our business.\nRestaurant companies have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings that are costly, divert management attention and, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial damages or settlement costs.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by team members, guests, suppliers, licensees, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. In recent years, restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked.\nOccasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to one of our Shacks, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness or accidents in our Shacks. We are also subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of our business, including contract claims. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce guest traffic and Shack sales. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance to cover any of these liabilities, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to risks related to our sale of alcoholic beverages.\nWe serve beer and wine at most of our Shacks. Alcoholic beverage control regulations generally require our Shacks to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that must be renewed annually and may be\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 33\nrevoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our Shacks, including minimum age of patrons and team members, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Any future failure to comply with these regulations and obtain or retain licenses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject in certain states to \"dram shop\" statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. Recent litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments and settlements under dram shop statutes. Because these cases often seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, such litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and resources away from operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC RISKS\nDamage to our reputation could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation and the quality of our brand are critical to our business and success in existing markets, and will be critical to our success as we enter new markets. We believe that we have built our reputation on the high quality of our food and service, our commitment to our guests, our strong team culture, and the atmosphere and design of our Shacks, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand in order for us to continue to be successful. Any incident that erodes consumer loyalty to our brand could significantly reduce its value and damage our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, including with respect to:\n\u25aafood safety concerns, including food tampering or contamination;\n\u25aafood-borne illness incidents;\n\u25aathe safety of the food commodities we use, particularly beef;\n\u25aaguest injury;\n\u25aasecurity breaches of confidential guest or team member information;\n\u25aathird-party service providers, particularly related to delivery services and information technology, and potential guest dissatisfaction from circumstances out of our control relating to third-party service providers;\n\u25aaemployment-related claims relating to alleged employment discrimination, wage and hour violations, labor standards or health care and benefit issues; or\n\u25aagovernment or industry findings concerning our Shacks, restaurants operated by other food service providers or others across the food industry supply chain.\nAdditionally, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices that provide individuals with access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning us may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nUltimately, the risks associated with any such negative publicity or incorrect information cannot be completely eliminated or mitigated and may materially harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 34\nChanges in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry depends on consumer discretionary spending, and any economic downturn or disruptions in the overall economy, including political unrest and protests, the impact of a housing crisis, high unemployment and financial market volatility and unpredictability, may cause a related reduction in consumer confidence, which negatively affects the restaurant industry. These factors, as well as national, regional and local regulatory and economic conditions, gasoline prices, energy and other utility costs, inclement weather, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, health care costs, access to credit, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence, affect discretionary consumer spending. Furthermore, with some of our Shacks located in or near retail malls, general declines in mall traffic experienced by the retail industry over the last few years in general may negatively affect us.\nIn poor economic conditions, guest traffic could be adversely impacted if our guests choose to dine out less frequently or reduce the amount they spend on meals while dining out. Reduced guest traffic could result in lower Shack sales and licensing revenue, as well as a decline in our profitability as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of Shack sales. Prolonged negative trends in sales could cause us and our licensees to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new Shack openings, close Shacks, delay remodeling of our existing Shacks or recognize asset impairment charges.\nBecause many of our domestic Company-operated Shacks are concentrated in local or regional areas, we are susceptible to economic and other trends and developments, including adverse weather conditions, in these areas.\nSince our founding, we have built some of the industry's favorite community gathering places. As a result, so much of our real estate footprint has been centered in urban, office, travel and dynamic traffic-driving sales environments. Our urban Shacks make up approximately 40% of the units in our same-Shack sales base, and have historically accounted for approximately 50% of our same-Shack sales base sales prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our financial performance is highly dependent on Shacks located in the Northeast and the New York City metropolitan area, which comprise approximately 29% (or 63 out of 218) of our total domestic Company-operated Shacks as of December 29, 2021. As a result, adverse economic conditions in any of these markets or regions could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. In addition, given our geographic concentrations, negative publicity regarding any of our Shacks in these areas and other regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, inclement weather or natural or man-made disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIn particular, adverse weather conditions, such as regional winter storms, floods, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes, could negatively impact our results of operations. Temporary or prolonged Shack closures may occur and guest traffic may decline due to the actual or perceived effects of future weather related events.\nSecurity breaches of either confidential guest information in connection with, among other things, our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions, kiosk ordering or mobile ordering app, or confidential team member information may adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires the collection, transmission and retention of large volumes of guest and team member data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information technology systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services. The integrity and protection of that guest and team member data is critical to us. Further, our guests and team members have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information.\nLike many other retail companies, and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, attempts to compromise our information technology systems. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. While we continue to make significant investment in physical and technological security measures, team member training, and third party services designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches, our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, team member error or malfeasance, utility failures, natural disasters\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 35\nor other catastrophic events. Due to these scenarios we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nAdditionally, the information, security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation are increasingly demanding. Our systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and guest and team member expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so. Efforts to hack or breach security measures, failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data all threaten our and our service providers' information systems and records. A breach in the security of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits. Additionally, a significant theft, loss or misappropriation of, or access to, guests' or other proprietary data or other breach of our information technology systems could result in fines, legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from guests and team members, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain and update our information technology systems to meet the needs of our business, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our Shacks, for management of our supply chain, accounting, payment of obligations, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions, digital ordering and other processes and procedures. As a rapidly growing business, our current information technology infrastructure may not be adequately suited to handle the increasing volume of data and additional information needs of our organization. If we are unable to successfully upgrade our information systems to meet the growing needs of our business or are delayed in doing so, whether through our enterprise-wide finance initiative Project Concrete or other future initiatives, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as technology systems continue to evolve and as consumers adopt new technologies, we may need to enhance our systems or modify our strategies in order to remain relevant in our industry and to our guests. If we are unable to successfully identify and implement new and emerging technologies, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we experience a material failure or interruption in our systems, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, expanding our systems as we grow or a breach in security of these systems could result in interruptions to or delays in our business and guest service and reduce efficiency in our operations. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nAdditionally, as we continue to evolve and innovate our digital platforms and enhance our internal systems, we place increasing reliance on third-parties to provide infrastructure and other support services. We may be adversely affected if any of our third-party service providers experience any interruptions in their systems, which could potentially impact the services we receive from them and cause a material failure or interruption in our own systems.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 36\nBecause a component of our strategy is to continue to grow our licensed business internationally, the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\n126 of our 151 licensed Shacks as of December 29, 2021 are located outside the United States and we expect to continue to expand our licensed operations internationally. As a result, we are and will be, on an increasing basis, subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u25aachanges in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate;\n\u25aathe imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate non-U.S. earnings in a tax effective manner;\n\u25aainability to achieve international tax treaty status with select license partners;\n\u25aathe presence and acceptance of business corruption in various international markets;\n\u25aathe ability to comply with, or impact of complying with, complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, intellectual property, licensing requirements and regulations and changes in applicable tax laws;\n\u25aathe difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries;\n\u25aathe ability to comply with, or impact of complying with, complex and changing laws, regulations and economic policies of the U.S. government, including U.S. laws and regulations relating to economic sanctions, export controls and anti-boycott requirements;\n\u25aaincrease in an anti-American sentiment and the identification of the licensed brand as an American brand;\n\u25aathe effect of disruptions caused by severe outbreak of disease, weather, natural disasters or other events that make travel to a particular region, as well as domestic visits, less attractive or more difficult; and\n\u25aapolitical and economic instability.\nAny or all of these factors may adversely affect the performance of and revenues we receive from our licensed Shacks located in international markets. Our international licensed Shacks operate in several volatile regions that are subject to geopolitical and socio-political factors that pose risk to our business operations. In the past, certain licensees have been negatively impacted by currency devaluation, and we have seen a reduction in licensing revenue from those respective Shacks.Also, the economy of any region in which our Shacks are located may be adversely affected to a greater degree than that of other areas of the country or the world by certain developments affecting industries concentrated in that region or country. For example, our Shacks that recently opened in Hong Kong have suffered from political unrest due to protesting in the area, and as such, have had to close in certain instances. Such closures result in a loss of sales for the respective time period. Additionally, a health outbreak, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could slow traffic in the impacted regions and could result in a loss of sales. While these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business. As our international licensed operations increase, these risks will become more pronounced.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, proprietary products and other intellectual property, including our name and logos and the unique character and atmosphere of our Shacks. We rely on U.S. and foreign trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Nevertheless, our competitors may develop similar menu items and concepts, and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and other intellectual property.\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in both domestic and international markets. We have registered and applied to register trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and service marks, and our competitors and others may successfully challenge the validity and/or enforceability of our trademarks and service marks and other intellectual property. Additionally, we may be prohibited from entering into certain new markets due to restrictions surrounding competitors' trademarks. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 37\nproperty in the United States and in foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nIf our efforts to maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.\nWe may also from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.\nThird parties may assert that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property and may sue us for intellectual property infringement. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs, and the time and attention of our management and other personnel may be diverted in pursuing these proceedings. If a court finds that we infringe a third party's intellectual property, we may be required to pay damages and/or be subject to an injunction. With respect to any third party intellectual property that we use or wish to use in our business (whether or not asserted against us in litigation), we may not be able to enter into licensing or other arrangements with the owner of such intellectual property at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms.\nWe depend on key members of our executive management team.\nWe depend on the leadership and experience of key members of our executive management team. The loss of the services of any of our executive management team members could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace such personnel on a timely basis or without incurring increased costs, or at all. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers. We believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. There is a high level of competition for experienced, successful personnel in our industry. Our inability to meet our executive staffing requirements in the future could impair our growth and harm our business.\nOur insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe maintain various insurance policies for team member health, workers' compensation, general liability, and property damage. We believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we are self-insured for our team member medical plan and we recognize a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of our estimates. If a greater amount of claims are reported, or if medial costs increase beyond what we expect, our liabilities may not be sufficient and we could recognize additional expense, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nREGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\nWe are subject to many federal, state and local laws, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, with which compliance is both costly and complex. Failure to comply with, or changes in these laws or requirements, could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to:\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 38\n\u25aaNutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements - There has been increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus on the food industry including nutritional and advertising practices. These changes have resulted in, and may continue to result in, the enactment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings. For example, a number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to customers, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. These labeling laws may change consumer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales. Additionally, an unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings.\n\u25aaFood safety regulations - There is a potential for increased regulation of certain food establishments in the United States, where compliance with a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (\"HACCP\") approach may be required. HACCP refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Additionally, our suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require us to take actions that could be costly for us or otherwise impact our business.\n\u25aaLocal licensure, building and zoning regulations - The development and operation of Shacks depend, to a significant extent, on the selection of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards. Typically, licenses, permits and approvals under such laws and regulations must be renewed annually and may be revoked, suspended or denied renewal for cause at any time if governmental authorities determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations. Difficulties or failure to maintain or obtain the required licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our existing Shacks and delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new Shacks, which would adversely affect our business.\n\u25aaEmployment regulations - We are subject to various federal and state laws governing our employment practices, including laws relating to minimum wage requirements, employee classifications as exempt or non-exempt, payroll and unemployment tax laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship and work authorization requirements, insurance and workers' compensation rules, scheduling notification requirements and anti-discrimination laws. Compliance with these regulations is costly and requires significant resources. For example, the Fair Workweek legislation implemented in New York City requires fast food employers to provide employees with specified notice in scheduling changes and pay premiums for changes made to employees' schedules, among other requirements. Similar legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions in which we operate as well, and in turn, could result in increased costs. Additionally, we may suffer losses from or incur significant costs to defend claims alleging non-compliance. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, our employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant number of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. Further, if we enter into a new market with unionized construction companies, or the construction companies in our current markets become unionized, construction and build out costs for new Shacks in such markets could materially increase.\n\u25aaThe Affordable Care Act - We are required to provide affordable coverage to substantially all full-time employees, or otherwise be subject to potential excise tax penalties based on the affordability criteria in the Act. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Increased health care and insurance costs, as well as the potential increase in participation by our employees who previously had not participated in our medical plan coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25aaThe Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and similar state laws - We are subject to the ADA and similar state laws, which, among other things, prohibits discrimination in employment and public accommodations on the basis of disability. Under the ADA, our Shacks are required to meet federally mandated requirements for the disabled and we could be required to incur expenses to modify our Shacks to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 39\nfor the employment of, disabled persons. The expenses associated with these modifications, or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with resolving ADA-related complaints could be material.\n\u25aaPrivacy and cybersecurity - Our business requires the collection, transmission and retention of large volumes of guest and employee data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by the European Union (EU). Regulatory requirements, both domestic and abroad, have been changing with increasing regulation relating to the privacy, security and protection of data. Such regulatory requirements may become more prevalent in other states and jurisdictions as well. It is our responsibility to ensure we are complying with these laws by taking the appropriate measures as well as monitoring our practices as these laws continue to evolve. As our environment continues to evolve in this digital age and reliance upon new technologies become more prevalent, it is imperative we secure the private and sensitive information we collect. Failure to do so, whether through fault of our own information systems or those of outsourced third party providers, could not only cause us to fail to comply with these laws and regulations, but also could cause us to face litigation and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our brand's reputation and our image as an employer could also be harmed by these types of security breaches or regulatory violations.\n\u25aaLaws and regulations related to our licensed operations - Our licensing operations are subject to laws enacted by a number of states, rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and certain rules and requirements regulating licensing activities in foreign countries. Failure to comply with new or existing licensing laws, rules and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could negatively affect our licensing sales and our relationships with our licensees.\n\u25aaU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws - A significant portion of our licensed operations are located outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations, in general prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our license agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, uncertainty around future changes in laws made by new regulatory administrations or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and, therefore, have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. In addition, certain laws, including the ADA, could require us to expend significant funds to make modifications to our Shacks if we fail to comply with applicable standards. Compliance with all of these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nAs of December 29, 2021, our federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards, for income tax purposes were $448.8 million and $237.7 million, respectively. If not utilized, $397.0 million of our federal NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely, and the remainder will begin to expire in 2035. If not utilized, $41.3 million of our state NOL carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, and the remainder will begin to expire in 2023. Federal NOLs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is subject to certain limitations.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d its ability to use its pre-change NOLs to offset its post-change income may be limited. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In connection with the equity offering, as\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 40\ndescribed in \"Part I. Item I. Business,\" herein, we conducted a Section 382 study to determine whether the use of our NOLs is limited. While we did not experience an ownership change related to the equity offering during 2021, we did experience an ownership change in the second quarter of 2018. An ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC establishes an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in a single year. The change in ownership that occurred in 2018 will not limit our ability to utilize the NOLs before the expiration of the NOL carryforward period. We may experience ownership changes in the future, including as a result of this offering or subsequent changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. This could limit the amount of NOLs that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. Subsequent statutory or regulatory changes in respect of the utilization of NOLs for federal or state purposes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or limitations on the deductibility of NOLs carried forward, or other unforeseen reasons, may result in our existing NOLs expiring or otherwise being unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes by the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities, and our tax liabilities will be affected by the allocation of expenses to differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25aachanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25aaexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowance;\n\u25aatax effects of equity-based compensation;\n\u25aachanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u25aafuture earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nWe may also be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, SSE Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the SSE Holdings LLC Agreement restricts transfers of LLC Interests that would cause SSE Holdings to be treated as a \"publicly traded partnership\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") were to contend successfully that SSE Holdings should be treated as a \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes, SSE Holdings would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and thus would be subject to entity-level tax on its taxable income, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial information or comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \"Exchange Act\"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. It also requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure of any material weaknesses in such controls. We are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in the implementation or improvement of such controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of management evaluations and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which may have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 41\ncommon stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nShake Shack has non-controlling interest holders, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nAs of December 29, 2021, the non-controlling interest holders control approximately 16.1% of the combined voting power of our common stock through their ownership of both our Class A and Class B common stock. The non-controlling interest holders, for the foreseeable future, have influence over corporate management and affairs, as well as matters requiring stockholder approval. The non-controlling interest holders are able to, subject to applicable law and the voting arrangements, participate in the election of a majority of the members of our Board of Directors and actions to be taken by us and our Board of Directors, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The directors so elected will have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and applicable rules and regulations, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. It is possible that the interests of the non-controlling interest holders may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the non-controlling interest holders may have different tax positions from us, especially in light of the tax receivable agreement we entered into with the non-controlling interest holders that provides for the payment by us to the non-controlling interest holders of 85% of the amount of any tax benefits that we actually realize, or in some cases are deemed to realize (the \"Tax Receivable Agreement\"). This could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when Shake Shack should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the determination of future tax reporting positions, the structuring of future transactions and the handling of any future challenges by any taxing authorities to our tax reporting positions may take into consideration these non-controlling interest holders' tax or other considerations, which may differ from the considerations of us or our other stockholders.\nIn addition, certain of the non-controlling interest holders are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and may hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or the business of our suppliers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the non-controlling interest holders or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business as us. The non-controlling interest holders may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the non-controlling interest holders that will not benefit Class A common stockholders to the same extent as it will benefit the non-controlling interest holders.\nWe are a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with the non-controlling interest holders. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to the non-controlling interest holders equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) the increases in the tax basis of the net assets of SSE Holdings resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests from the non-controlling interest holders and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to our making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe expect that the amount of the cash payments that we are required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be significant. Any payments made by us to the non-controlling interest holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned on any non-controlling interest holders continued ownership of LLC Interests or our Class A common stock after the IPO.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 42\nThe actual amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges by the holders of LLC Interests, the amount of gain recognized by such holders of LLC Interests, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, and the federal tax rates then applicable.\nThe non-controlling interest holders have the right to have their LLC Interests redeemed or exchanged into shares of Class A common stock, which may cause volatility in our stock price.\nWe have an aggregate of 160,857,603 shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including 2,921,587 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the redemption or exchange of LLC Interests held by the non-controlling interest holders. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the SSE Holdings LLC Agreement, the non-controlling interest holders are entitled to have their LLC Interests redeemed or exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict the timing or size of any future issuances of our Class A common stock resulting from the redemption or exchange of LLC Interests or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe will continue to incur relatively outsized costs as a result of becoming a public company and in the administration of our complex organizational structure.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We have also incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. These rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming. These laws and regulations also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. Furthermore, if we are unable to continue to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we would be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur organizational structure, including our Tax Receivable Agreement, is very complex and we require the expertise of various tax, legal and accounting advisers to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We have and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the administration of our organizational structure. As a result, our expenses for legal, tax and accounting compliance may be significantly greater than other companies of our size that do not have a similar organizational structure or a tax receivable agreement in place.\nOur anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of our Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u25aathe authority to issue \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25aaour classified board of directors providing that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;\n\u25aathe removal of directors only for cause;\n\u25aaprohibiting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors;\n\u25aalimiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or amend our bylaws;\n\u25aarequiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u25aaour advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 43\nThese provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), to which we are subject, prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who owns at least 15% of our common stock.\nThe provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on shares of our Class A common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We are a holding company, and substantially all of our operations are carried out by SSE Holdings and its subsidiaries. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, SSE Holdings is currently restricted from paying cash dividends, and we expect these restrictions to continue in the future. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, if you purchase shares, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our Class A common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT\nWe are a holding company and our principal asset is our interest in SSE Holdings, and, accordingly, we will depend on distributions from SSE Holdings to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. SSE Holdings' ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in SSE Holdings and certain deferred tax assets. As such, we will have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the distributions we receive from SSE Holdings. There can be no assurance that SSE Holdings will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt instruments, will permit such distributions.\nSSE Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to its members, including us. Accordingly, we will incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of SSE Holdings. Under the terms of the SSE Holdings LLC Agreement, SSE Holdings is obligated to make tax distributions to its members, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which we expect will be\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 44\nsignificant. We intend, as its managing member, to cause SSE Holdings to make cash distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to (i) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to them and (ii) cover our operating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, SSE Holdings' ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which SSE Holdings is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering SSE Holdings insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay our tax and other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, if SSE Holdings does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the non-controlling interest holders may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, our obligations, or our successor's obligations, under the Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments thereunder would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAs a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) if we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Furthermore, any increases in the federal corporate tax rate may result in an increase in our Tax Receivable Agreement liability, including a gross up of our deferred tax balances.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the non-controlling interest holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the IRS or another tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain such challenge. If the outcome of any such challenge would reasonably be expected to materially affect a recipient's payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, then we will not be permitted to settle or fail to contest such challenge without the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of each non-controlling interest holder that directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the outstanding LLC Interests. We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the non-controlling interest holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made to non-controlling interest holders are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to non-controlling interest holders will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make to such non-controlling interest holders under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to a non-controlling interest holder for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, if any of our tax reporting positions are challenged by a taxing authority, we will not be permitted to reduce any future cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until any such challenge is finally settled or determined. As a result, payments could be made under\nShake Shack Inc. Form 10-K | 45\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of the tax savings that we realize in respect of the tax attributes with respect to non-controlling interest holders that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay special interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the $250.0 million 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, any sales in the public market of our Class A common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our Class A common stock could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indenture governing the Notes will require us, except as described in this offering memorandum, to repurchase the Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it costlier for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nShake Shack Inc.
