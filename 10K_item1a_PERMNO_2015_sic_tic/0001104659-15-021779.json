Risk Factors\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including under the section titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and our other reports we may file with the SEC from time to time, and the documents and other information incorporated by reference herein and therein, for a detailed discussion of known material factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks and uncertainties described are not the only ones we face. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. If any of these risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is cyclical and dependent upon conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, which impact the level of exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas and capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies. Our customers\u2019 willingness to undertake exploration and production activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas. If these expenditures decline, our business may suffer. The oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile, is highly sensitive to supply and demand cycles and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends. Our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n\u00b7 the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including current natural gas storage capacity and usage;\n\u00b7 the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u00b7 the current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices;\n\u00b7 the supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and other well service equipment in the United States;\n\u00b7 the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 public pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u00b7 the expected rates of decline of current oil and natural gas production;\n\u00b7 lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of personnel;\n\u00b7 regulation of drilling activity;\n\u00b7 the discovery and development rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7 available pipeline and other transportation capacity;\n\u00b7 weather conditions, including hurricanes, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u00b7 political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u00b7 domestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u00b7 technical advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7 the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7 merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.\nVolatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) generally leads to decreased spending by our customers, which in turn negatively impacts exploration, development and production activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work. When these capital investments decline, our customers\u2019 demand for our services declines. Because these types of services can be easily \u201cstarted\u201d and \u201cstopped,\u201d and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we typically experience a more rapid decline in demand for our services during periods of volatility in prices compared with demand for other types of energy services. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Any negative impact on the spending patterns of our customers may cause lower pricing and utilization for our core service lines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSpending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil and natural gas prices are higher than historical norms. Any such cuts in spending may curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, and the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, or a decrease in the development rate of reserves, in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nWe may be unable to implement price increases or maintain existing prices on our core services.\nPressure on pricing for our hydraulic fracturing and other core services, including due to competition and industry and/or economic conditions, may impact, among other things, our ability to implement price increases or maintain pricing on our core services. We operate in a very competitive industry and, as a result, we may not always be successful in raising, or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity, including hydraulic fracturing equipment and coiled tubing units, may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase or maintain prices. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our profitability.\nVolatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers\u2019 activity levels, which may indirectly limit our ability to increase or maintain prices. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Over the past several months, oil prices have declined significantly due in large part to increasing supplies, weakening demand growth and the decision by OPEC not to cut production. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels by our customers.\nEven when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our prices or to increase our prices as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nDelays in deliveries of key raw materials or increases in the cost of key raw materials could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established relationships with a limited number of suppliers of our raw materials and finished products. Should any of our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary raw materials or finished products\nor otherwise fail to deliver the products in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, increasing costs of certain raw materials may negatively impact demand for our services or the profitability of our business operations. In the past, our industry faced sporadic proppant shortages associated with hydraulic fracturing operations requiring work stoppages, which adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of raw materials, including proppants.\nWeather conditions could materially impair our business.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by severe weather events and natural disasters. Furthermore, our customers\u2019 operations may be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. For example, hurricanes, tropical storms, heavy snow, ice or rain may result in customer delays and other disruptions to our services. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u00b7 curtailment of services;\n\u00b7 weather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u00b7 inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules;\n\u00b7 increase in the price of insurance; and\n\u00b7 loss of productivity.\nThese constraints could also delay our operations, reduce our revenue and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility in the energy service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a different work environment. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. At times, demand for skilled workers in our geographic area of operations is high, and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect completion and production activities by oil and natural gas companies and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nThe demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for completion and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of completion and production activities, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. For example, within the past year, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel and have been as low as $42 per barrel. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by OPEC, affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and natural gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of, demand for, and price of oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices have caused some of our customers to terminate, seek to renegotiate or fail to honor their contracts and affected the fair market value of our rig fleet, which in turn has resulted in impairments of assets. A sustained or further decline in oil and natural gas prices could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect\nour ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with significant excess capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe oilfield services industry is very competitive. Oilfield services companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Completion and well servicing equipment, such as hydraulic fracturing fleets and workover and well-servicing rigs, can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area. In many markets where we operate, the number of rigs available for use exceeds the demand for rigs, resulting in price competition. In recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features can determine which contractor is awarded a job, which requires continued technology advancement. The land drilling market generally is more competitive than the offshore drilling market because there are a greater number of rigs and competitors.\nNew technology may hurt our competitive position.\nThe energy service industry is subject to the introduction of new completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies or technologies comparable to ours in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies before we can. Additionally, we may be unable to implement new technologies or products at all, on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Limits on our ability to effectively use or implement new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the energy services industry. The nature of our operations presents hazards and other inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry, particularly with respect to the workover, well-servicing and pressure pumping industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others.\nAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pricing pressure in our insurance renewals; our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect demand for our support services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly perform hydraulic fracturing services for our customers. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority\npursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 that applies to such activities. In 2012, the EPA also promulgated new rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and gas production and natural gas processing operations. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the agency\u2019s intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances and Control Act related to the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA is also conducting a study of the potential environmental impacts from hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources and developing rules on effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities, both which are expected for publication in early 2015. In addition, the federal Bureau of Land Management finalized new regulations in March 2015 on hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal lands, including the disclosure of chemical additives used; the regulations are already subject to legal challenge. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy released a report on hydraulic fracturing, recommending the implementation of a variety of measures to reduce the environmental impacts from shale-gas production. In addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced before the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, there has been public opposition to hydraulic fracturing, which could lead to legal changes and additional legislative or regulatory initiatives.\nCertain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the EPA is performing a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA\u2019s study includes 18 separate research projects addressing topics such as water acquisition, chemical mixing, well injection, flowback and produced water and wastewater treatment and disposal. The EPA has indicated that it expects to issue its study report sometime in 2015. The EPA is also developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. Depending on their results, these studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory programs.\nIn addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain environmentally sensitive areas such as certain watersheds. For example, Texas has adopted legislation that requires the public disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process to the Railroad Commission of Texas and to the public, whereas, on December 17, 2014, the State of New York announced that hydraulic fracturing will be banned due to public health and environmental concerns identified in its several year study. In addition, municipalities in Colorado and several other states have adopted or are in the process of adopting ordinances restricting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions. The widespread adoption of ordinances limiting hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect our business.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise banning or limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells in shale formations, increase costs of regulatory compliance and adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other regulatory agencies, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in cost, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act including one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that requires certain construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from specified GHG emission sources,\nincluding, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. Further, the EPA recently proposed strict regulations with respect to GHG emissions from certain new and existing power plants. In addition to the EPA, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs operate by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.\nAny new federal, regional or state restrictions on emissions of GHGs that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions on our customers. Such legislation could potentially make our customers\u2019 products more expensive and thus reduce demand for them, which could have a material adverse effect on us and demand for our services. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the emission or discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety. Any failure by us to comply with such environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against us that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the following:\n\u00b7 issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u00b7 modification, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u00b7 imposition of limitations on our operations; and\n\u00b7 performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nAs part of our business, we handle, transport and dispose of a variety of fluids and substances used by our customers in connection with their oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. We also generate and dispose of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes. Such activities are subject to strict regulation for the prevention of oil spills and release of hazardous substances, and can lead to liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. The generation, handling, transportation and disposal of these fluids, substances and wastes are regulated by a number of laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the RCRA, the Clean Water Act, SDWA and analogous state laws. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to liability for governmental penalties, third-party claims, cleanup costs associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. Moreover, certain of these environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability, even though our conduct in performing such activities was lawful at the time it occurred or the liability was the result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties.\nIn addition, environmental laws and regulations are subject to frequent change. Changes in environmental laws may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress that would reclassify some oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes under RCRA, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. If existing laws, regulatory requirements\nor enforcement policies were to change in the future, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nMore stringent trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs part of the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and therefore we are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) and by other various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, require on board black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase the our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nLegal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. From time to time, we are also subject to complaints and allegations of violations of employment-related laws by former, current or prospective employees.\nLawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur profitability could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global financial markets.\nChanges in general financial and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in ways we cannot predict. If global markets and economic conditions deteriorate in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our liquidity and those of our customers and other worldwide business partners.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe Merger is subject to customary approvals and conditions which may adversely impact the timing of the transaction and our ability to consummate the transaction.\nThe Merger is subject to customary approvals and conditions, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, the availability of the proceeds of the debt financing to effect the cash payment to NIL in connection with the Closing. We expect that the Closing will occur in March 2015 following the special meeting of C&J stockholders held on March 20, 2015; however, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be consummated within the anticipated timeframe or at all, including as the result of regulatory, market or other factors. Further, any delay in the consummation of the Merger could cause the combined company not to realize all or some of the synergies that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe and could result in additional transaction costs or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Merger, which may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nA lawsuit has been filed challenging the Merger, and any injunctive relief or adverse judgment for rescission or money damages could delay or prevent the Merger from being completed or could have a material adverse effect on us following the Merger.\nOn July 30, 2014, NIL and we, along with C&J and the C&J board of directors, were sued by an alleged C&J stockholder in a putative shareholder class action filed on behalf of the C&J stockholders. The lawsuit is styled City of Miami General Employees\u2019 and Sanitation Employees\u2019 Retirement Trust, et al. v. C&J Energy Services, Inc., et al.; C.A. No. 9980-VCN, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d).\nThe plaintiff alleges that the members of the C&J board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger, and that we and C&J aided and abetted these alleged breaches. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with or consummating the Merger and the C&J stockholder meeting for approval of the Merger and, to the extent that the Merger is completed before any relief is granted, to have the Merger rescinded. On November 10, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, and, on November 24, 2014, the Court of Chancery entered a bench ruling, followed by a written order on November 25, 2014, that (i) ordered certain members of the C&J board of directors to solicit for a 30 day period alternative proposals to purchase C&J (or a controlling stake in C&J) that are superior to the Merger, and (ii) preliminarily enjoined C&J from holding its stockholder meeting until it complied with the foregoing. C&J complied with the order while it simultaneously pursued an expedited appeal of the Court of Chancery\u2019s order to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDelaware Supreme Court\u201d). On December 19, 2014, the Delaware Supreme Court overturned the Court of Chancery\u2019s judgment and vacated the order.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit or any others that might be filed in the future in connection with the Merger, nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve such litigation. One of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order or judgment or any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger be in effect and completion of the Merger is not illegal under any applicable law, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction, which condition, if not satisfied, could delay or jeopardize the consummation of the Merger. An adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin the Merger, and an adverse judgment for rescission or monetary damages could have a material adverse effect on us following the Merger.\nRisks Related to Us After the Pending C&J Transaction\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry, and we may not be able to finance future growth of our operations or future acquisitions.\nUpon consummation of the Pending C&J Transaction, we expect to have approximately $1.1 billion in total indebtedness, and $520 million available for additional borrowings. Following the Closing, the substantial indebtedness that will be incurred in connection with the Pending C&J Transaction, could limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance future growth and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Additionally, the financial and other restrictive covenants obligations contained in the agreements governing that indebtedness may restrict our operational flexibility and our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, working capital or capital expenditures, or to fulfill debt service requirements or other cash requirements.\nThe successful execution of our growth strategy depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows and/or raise additional capital as needed. Our ability to fund future growth depends on our performance, which is impacted by factors beyond our control, including financial, business, economic and other factors, such as potential changes in customer preferences and pressure from competitors. Although we believe we are well positioned to finance our future growth, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable continue growing our business or to sustain or increase our current level profitability. Our inability to grow our business may adversely impact our ability to sustain or improve our profits.\nWe may not realize the anticipated cost synergies and growth opportunities.\nWe expect that we will realize cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the Pending C&J Transaction. Our success in realizing these cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business operations with those of C&J. Even if we are able to integrate our business with C&J\u2019s business successfully, we cannot predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. For example, the benefits from the Pending C&J Transaction may be offset by costs incurred in integrating our business with C&J\u2019s business. Realization of any benefits and cost synergies could be affected by the other risks described in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and a number of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and regulatory developments.\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of NIL, we were not required to comply with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a public company with listed equity securities, such requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we will need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), related regulations of the SEC, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the NYSE, which we were not previously required to comply with as a private company. Because our Form S-4 was declared effective by the SEC on February 13, 2015, we are currently subject to, and are in full compliance with, the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and certain corporate governance provisions of SOX. We will become subject to NYSE requirements once our common shares are listed on the NYSE upon the completion of the Merger. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and may significantly increase our costs and expenses. While combining C&J and our accounting and operations functions, we will need to:\n\u00b7 institute a comprehensive compliance function;\n\u00b7 design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u00b7 comply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;\n\u00b7 prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u00b7 establish new internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading; and\n\u00b7 involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nIf our profitability is adversely affected because of these additional costs, it could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations and the trading price of our common shares.\nWe and our subsidiaries will be required to indemnify NIL for taxes imposed as a result of certain actions taken by us if such actions adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the U.S. Distributions.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement to be entered into between us and NIL in connection with the Closing (the \u201cTax Matters Agreement\u201d) prohibits us from taking actions that could cause the U.S. Distributions (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement) to be taxable. In particular, for two years after the Merger (the \u201crestriction period\u201d), we and our subsidiaries may not take any of the following actions (each, a \u201crestricted action\u201d):\n\u00b7 issue our shares, options, warrants or similar interests or such interests of any entity in the chain of Nabors Completion & Production Services Co. (\u201cNCPS\u201d) ownership (including NCPS) (i) to any person in connection with a public offering or a private placement, (a) if such person would be a \u201cten-percent shareholder\u201d or a \u201ccoordinating group\u201d that is treated as a ten-percent shareholder, directly or indirectly, of NCPS (in each case, as defined in U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(h)) or (b) which is taken into account for purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code as a result of pre-Merger actions of C&J, or (ii) as consideration to effect a merger with or acquisition of any entity (or affiliate of such entity) included on a list of entities provided by NIL (the \u201cProhibited Entities List\u201d);\n\u00b7 discontinue the active conduct of our business as conducted prior to the Pending C&J Transaction, or voluntarily dissolve or liquidate (including any action that is treated as a liquidation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) us or any of our subsidiaries that conduct the C&P Business;\n\u00b7 sell or dispose of any entity that will be our subsidiary after the Merger and is or will be in the chain of ownership that includes NCPS (including NCPS); or\n\u00b7 sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets (including stock of subsidiaries) that constitute more than 30% of the consolidated gross assets of NCPS (subject to exceptions for, among other things, ordinary course dispositions and repayments or prepayments of our indebtedness).\nIf we wish to take any such restricted action, we will be required to cooperate with NIL in obtaining a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or to provide NIL with an unqualified tax opinion, in each case that is reasonably satisfactory to NIL, unless NIL waives this requirement in writing, concluding that such action would not adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the U.S. Distributions. In addition to the foregoing restrictions, we will be required during the restriction period to consult with NIL prior to taking any of the following actions (each, a \u201cconsultation action\u201d):\n\u00b7 issuing shares, options, warrants or similar interests (other than any such interests (i) issued to a person for the performance of services as an employee, director or independent contractor for us, C&J or any affiliate in a transaction to which Code Section 83 or 421(a) or (b) applies, (ii) that are prohibited from being issued as a restricted action described above or (iii) subject to preemptive rights under our memorandum of association or amended bye-laws);\n\u00b7 merging with, or agreeing to be acquired by, an entity that is not on the Prohibited Entities List; or\n\u00b7 amending the memorandum of association, bye-laws or certificate of incorporation, or taking any other action affecting the relative voting rights of the capital stock or common shares, of Red Lion or any entity in the chain of NCPS ownership (including NCPS).\nBecause of these restrictions, we may be limited in the amount of shares that we can issue to make acquisitions or raise additional capital in the two years subsequent to the completion of the Merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we take (i) a restricted action or (ii) a consultation action that NIL has informed us has a reasonable risk of causing the U.S. Distributions to fail to achieve the intended tax treatment, we generally will be required to indemnify NIL for taxes arising as a result of our taking such restricted action or consultation action. Our obligation to indemnify NIL for taxes resulting from a restricted action is not impaired by NIL\u2019s receipt of an IRS ruling, acceptance of our unqualified tax opinion or waiver of either of these requirements with respect to such restricted action. In addition, our indemnification obligation could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or our subsidiaries after the Merger that is or will be in the chain of ownership that includes NCPS (including NCPS) during the restriction period.\nIf Nabors consolidated U.S. federal income tax group were to recognize gain on the U.S. Distributions for reasons not related to our taking a restricted action or a consultation action as described in the previous paragraph, NIL would be responsible for any resulting taxes and would not be entitled to be indemnified under the Tax Matters Agreement for any taxes imposed on such gain. Pursuant to the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder, each member of the Nabors consolidated U.S. federal income tax group (including NCPS) would be severally liable\nfor such taxes. As a result, to the extent NIL is unable to pay such taxes, the IRS may seek payment from NCPS. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, NIL is required to indemnify us if the IRS collects such taxes from NCPS. However, there can be no assurance that NIL would be able to fulfill its obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement if NIL was determined to be responsible thereunder.\nThe substantial indebtedness that will be incurred by us and our subsidiaries in connection with the Pending C&J Transaction could adversely affect our operations and financial condition after the Pending C&J Transaction.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur up to $1.625 billion of indebtedness in connection with the Pending C&J Transaction and related financing transactions. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Pending C&J Transaction and the financings provided for in the new Senior Secured Credit Agreement by and among us, USHC, certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Agreement\u201d), we would have a total of approximately $1.1 billion of debt outstanding but would still have the ability to incur additional debt under our new Senior Secured Credit Agreement in the amount of $520 million.\nOur and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness could have negative consequences to us after the Pending C&J Transaction, such as:\n\u00b7 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, potential strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, working capital or capital expenditures, or to fulfill debt service requirements or other cash requirements;\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions;\n\u00b7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7 to the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates; and\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to buy back our common shares or pay cash dividends.\nWe may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms after the Pending C&J Transaction.\nOur ability to meet our expense and debt service obligations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in customer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. Should our revenues decline after the Pending C&J Transaction, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay our debt service obligations when due. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations after the Pending C&J Transaction or should we fail to comply with our financial and other restrictive covenants, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or borrow more money. We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt or access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results from operations after the Pending C&J Transaction.\nWe will be subject to restrictive debt covenants after the Pending C&J Transaction, which may restrict our operational flexibility.\nUnder the new Senior Secured Credit Agreement, we and our subsidiaries may incur up to $1.105 billion of senior secured indebtedness. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries are expected to incur up to $520 million in senior\nunsecured bridge loans. After the Pending C&J Transaction, the agreements governing our indebtedness will contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests, including minimum interest coverage and maximum total leverage and secured leverage ratios and covenants that may limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens or indebtedness, sell or otherwise dispose of their assets, make certain restricted payments and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates and prepay certain indebtedness.\nBusiness growth could outpace the capabilities of our infrastructure.\nWe cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand. Future growth after the Merger could impose significant additional demands on our existing infrastructure, resulting in additional responsibilities on members of our senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan.\nBusiness issues currently faced by one company may be imputed to the operations of the other company.\nTo the extent that any of C&J, NIL or we currently have or are perceived by customers to have operational challenges, such as on-time performance, safety issues or workforce issues, those challenges may raise concerns by existing customers of the other companies following the Merger, which may limit or impede our future ability to obtain additional work from those customers.\nOur sales after the Merger could decrease if parties who are currently customers of both C&J and us elect to reduce their reliance on the combined company after the Merger.\nWe currently have some customer overlap with C&J. If any of these customers in common decreases the amount of its business with either C&J or us before the Merger or with us following the Merger to reduce its reliance on the combined company, such decrease in business could adversely impact our sales and profitability following the Merger.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nThere is no existing market for our common shares, and we do not know if one will develop to provide you with adequate liquidity to sell your common shares. The price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nPrior to the Pending C&J Transaction, there has not been a public market for our common shares. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market on the NYSE or otherwise or how liquid that market might become after the Closing. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any of our common shares that you own. Active, liquid and orderly trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. Upon completion of the Pending C&J Transaction, current holders of C&J common stock may not be able to resell their Red Lion common shares at or above the trading price of C&J common stock immediately prior to the Merger or at all. The lack of liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares and limit the number of investors who are able to buy our common shares.\nThe market price of our common shares may be influenced by many factors, many of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our common shares, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our common shares.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect the price of our common shares:\n\u00b7 our operating and financial performance, and our ability to integrate C&J and the C&P Business and to realize operational and other synergies;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;\n\u00b7 the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7 strategic actions by our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n\u00b7 speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7 the failure of research analysts to cover our common shares, adverse changes to research analyst recommendations or the failure of our operating results to meet research analyst expectations;\n\u00b7 actions by our shareholders, including sales of our common shares by NIL or other shareholders or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u00b7 general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u00b7 changes in tax law or interpretations thereof;\n\u00b7 domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u00b7 the realization of any risks described under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs to us, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe majority of our common shares will be held by NIL or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, and NIL will initially be able to control most shareholder votes.\nHolders of our common shares will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our memorandum of association or amended bye-laws. Immediately following the Closing, NIL or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries will own approximately 53% of our issued and outstanding common shares. Although NIL will be subject to certain standstill restrictions during the period that will begin on the closing date of the Merger and end upon the earlier to occur of the five-year anniversary of the effective date of the Merger and the date that NIL beneficially owns less than 15% of our issued and outstanding common shares (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), NIL will have the right to vote its majority shares in its discretion. Further, NIL has the right to ensure that three individuals who are selected by NIL will serve on our board of directors during the Standstill Period, and such individuals may remain on our board of directors following the end of the Standstill Period. In addition, until the later to occur of the termination of the Standstill Period and the two-year anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, NIL will have preemptive rights to purchase its pro rata portion of any common shares or other equity securities issued by us. Our amended bye-laws will provide that, until the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, certain major transactions, including any sale of Red Lion or any amendment to our memorandum of association or amended bye-laws, require the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our issued and outstanding common shares, and in certain circumstances the approval of a specified number of the members of our board of directors. As a result, NIL may be able to prevent the approval of such matters, and therefore may be able to prevent a change in control of us\nthat could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common shares as part of a sale of Red Lion. The existence of significant shareholders may also have the effect of deterring a would-be acquirer of Red Lion from proposing a transaction or delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management. In addition, NIL may be able to influence our management because of its substantial shareholding.\nUnder the provisions of our amended bye-laws to be in effect upon consummation of the Merger, until the end of the Standstill Period, the rights of our shareholders to change the amended bye-laws relating to the election of directors and the removal of directors are subject to restrictions.\nIn any of these matters, the interests of NIL may differ or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. Moreover, this concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common shares to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning shares of a company with a controlling shareholder.\nUnder the rules of the NYSE, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with the requirements that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, that its board of directors\u2019 compensation committee be comprised solely of independent directors, and that director nominees be selected or recommended to the board of directors for selection by independent directors. Although we will qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d upon completion of the Merger under the NYSE rules, we do not expect to rely on this exemption and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the NYSE rules. However, if we were to use some or all of these exemptions, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE rules regarding corporate governance.\nIf NIL sells a controlling interest in us to a third party in a private transaction, our shareholders may not realize any change-of-control premium on our common shares and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party.\nImmediately following the Closing, NIL or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries will own approximately 53% of our issued and outstanding common shares. NIL has agreed not to transfer our common shares for 180 days following the Closing and thereafter, during the Standstill Period, to transfer our common shares only to any person or \u201cgroup\u201d (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) who has not filed a Schedule 13D with regard to us and is not required to file a Schedule 13D after giving effect to such transfer. However, following the end of the Standstill Period, should it continue to own a significant equity interest in us and choose to do so, NIL may sell some or all of its Red Lion common shares in a privately negotiated transaction, which, if sufficient in size, could result in a change of control of us. The ability of NIL to privately sell its Red Lion common shares after the end of the Standstill Period, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the other Red Lion common shares, could prevent our shareholders from realizing any change-of-control premium on our common shares that may otherwise accrue to NIL upon its private sale of our common shares. Additionally, if NIL privately sells its significant equity interest in us, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with our other shareholders.\nFuture sales of our common shares in the public market could reduce its share price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may issue additional common shares or convertible securities in future public offerings. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common shares or securities convertible into common shares or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common shares will have on the market price of its common shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or employee benefit plan), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common shares.\nAdditionally, NIL or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries will own approximately 53% of our issued and outstanding common shares immediately following the Closing. While NIL has agreed not to transfer our common shares for 180 days following the Closing, subject to compliance with the restrictions on transfers by Nabors during the Standstill Period and with the Securities Act or exemptions therefrom, Nabors may\nsell such shares at any time after the expiration of the 180-day period. Any sale by Nabors of our common shares, any announcement by Nabors that it has decided to sell our common shares following the Standstill Period, or the perception by the investment community that Nabors has sold or decided to sell our common shares, could have an adverse impact on the price of our common shares.\nOur memorandum of association and amended bye-laws, as well as Bermuda law, will contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nOur amended bye-laws authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred shares, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended bye-laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders, including provisions which:\n\u00b7 limit the removal and replacement of directors, including provisions relating to the classified board of directors;\n\u00b7 limit the ability of shareholders to increase the number of directors;\n\u00b7 establish preemptive rights; and\n\u00b7 establish advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to the Red Lion board of directors.\nWe may issue preferred shares on terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of its common shares.\nOur amended bye-laws authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred shares having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common shares respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred shares could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common shares. For example, we might grant holders of preferred shares the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred shares could affect the residual value of our common shares.", "PERMNO": 16602, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "CJ"}
