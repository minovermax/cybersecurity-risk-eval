{"cik": "1667313", "company": "Zedge, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks associated with any one of our businesses, as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document, particularly the discussions about competition. The trading price of our Class B common stock could decline due to any of these risks.\nIf our digital brands including our Zedge app and Emojipedia fail to attract advertisers or if its advertisers reduce their spending with us, our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 80% of our revenues were generated from our Zedge app selling advertising inventory. We anticipate that our growth and profitability will continue to depend on our ability to sell our advertising inventory. Companies that advertise with us may choose to utilize other advertising channels or may reduce or eliminate their marketing altogether for a variety of reasons, many of which are out of our control, including, without limitation, if the demand for mobile phone personalization industry declines or otherwise falls out of favor with advertisers or consumers.\nIf the size of the digital advertising market does not increase from current levels, or if our Zedge app and/or Emojipedia website are unable to capture and retain a sufficient share of that market, our ability to maintain or increase our current level of advertising revenues and our revenues, profitability and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe digital advertising market may deteriorate or develop more slowly than expected, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe generate substantial majority of our revenue from our Zedge app and from our Emojipedia website selling advertising inventory. We anticipate that our growth and profitability will continue to depend on our ability to sell advertising inventory across our digital brands.\nMobile connected devices, especially smartphones, are a relatively new advertising medium. Advertisers have historically spent a smaller portion of their advertising budgets on mobile media as compared to traditional advertising methods, such as television, newspapers, radio and billboards, or online advertising over the internet, such as placing banner ads on websites.\nFuture demand and market acceptance for mobile advertising is uncertain. Many advertisers still have limited experience with mobile advertising and may continue to devote larger portions of their advertising budgets to more traditional offline or online personal computer-based advertising, instead of shifting additional advertising resources to mobile advertising.\nFurther, our advertisers\u2019 ability to effectively target their advertising to our user\u2019s interests may be negatively impacted by the degree to which our privacy control measures that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with regulations, regulatory actions, the user experience, or otherwise, and our advertising revenue may decrease or otherwise be curtailed as a result. Changes to operating systems\u2019 practices and policies, such as Apple\u2019s deprecating the Identifier for Advertisers (\u201cIDFA\u201d) and Google\u2019s expected deprecation of \u201ctracking cookies\u201d may also reduce the quantity and quality of the data and metrics that can be collected or used by us and our partners. These limitations may adversely affect our advertisers\u2019 ability to effectively target advertisements and measure their performance, which could reduce the demand and pricing for our advertising products and harm our business. As such, our digital property\u2019s current and potential advertiser clients may ultimately find digital advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising media or marketing methods or other technologies for promoting their products and services, and they may even reduce their spending on mobile advertising from current levels as a result or for other reasons.\nIf the market for mobile advertising deteriorates, or develops more slowly than we expect, we may not be able to increase our revenues or our revenues and profitability could decline materially.\nWe may not be successful in diversifying our revenue mix to reduce our significant dependence on third-party advertisers.\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 80% of our revenues were generated from our Zedge app selling advertising inventory. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in diversifying our revenue mix by identifying new revenue drivers that complement our advertising-heavy business. Although we have had initial success in converting freemium users into paid subscribers, starting with zero in January 2019 and ending fiscal 2021 with approximately 752,000, there is no guarantee that we will continue growing at this pace or how many of our current subscribers will remain as paying subscribers. To date, Zedge Premium has taken longer to scale than we originally anticipated, and we have not experienced the success that we anticipated by selling print-on-demand merchandise which sells at a higher price unit price than the other digital goods that we offer. We previously thought that certain marketers would embrace our platform as a critical distribution medium enabling us to secure a recurring set of advertisers willing to pay for sponsorships, but this has not yet occurred and may not occur. Finally, Android users are prone to spend less money in apps than iOS users. Even if our new initiatives are successful with our Android users, we may not able to replicate that success on iOS, especially since we have fewer iOS users.\nOur revenues may fluctuate materially due to increases and decreases of new mobile device sales, over which we have no control.\nOur revenue may be materially negatively impacted by a decrease or slowdown in new mobile device sales. Demand for mobile devices correlates to installs of the Zedge app and associated usage and revenue generation.\nInitially the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our Zedge app\u2019s new user growth. New smartphone sales suffered as a result of retail business closures, negatively impacting new user growth, especially in well-developed markets. Assuming the retail business rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that our Zedge app\u2019s new user growth will also recover and we will benefit accordingly but there can no assurance of such rebound or new user growth.\nIf new mobile device sales decrease or slowdown, our Zedge app will experience fewer installations which will negatively impact our revenue and operations.\nIf mobile connected devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels develop in ways that violate policies of Google Play or the App Store, prevent users from downloading our Zedge app or block advertising from being delivered to our Zedge app\u2019s users, our ability to grow our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business model depends upon the continued compatibility between our Zedge app and the major mobile operating systems. Third parties with whom we do not have any formal relationships control the design of mobile devices and operating systems. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers, including but not limited to Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile, may also impact the ability to download apps or access specified content on mobile devices.\nWe rely upon third-party distribution platforms, including the Google Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store, for distribution of our Zedge app. The Google Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store are global application distribution platforms and the main distribution channels for our Zedge app. As such, the promotion, distribution and operation of our Zedge app are subject to the respective distribution platforms\u2019 standard terms and policies for application developers, which are very broad and subject to frequent changes and interpretation. Furthermore, the distribution platforms may not enforce their standard terms and policies for application developers consistently and uniformly across all applications and with all publishers.\nFor example, in September 2019, our Zedge app was temporarily removed from Google Play because they asserted that the Zedge app violated their malicious behavior policy. As a result, prospective Android users were prevented from installing our Zedge app, freemium users were unable to convert into paying subscribers and existing users we unable to purchase Zedge Credits. Shortly after the notice was issued, two of our major advertising suppliers ceased serving advertisements to our Zedge app. In addition, Google Play sent a notification to users that had the problematic version of the app on their phone recommending that they uninstall it. We identified the source of the problem as buggy code from a long-term, third-party advertising partner\u2019s standard technology integration in our app. We corrected the problem by removing the offensive code, releasing a new version of our app and our Zedge app was reinstated after approximately 72 hours and concurrently the two major advertising suppliers resumed purchasing our advertising inventory. We estimate the immediate financial impact of the suspension resulted in approximately $100,000 in lost revenue and a material decline in MAU with the majority of uninstalls in emerging markets.\nIn addition, if any of these providers were to limit or disable advertising on their platforms, devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because a maker of these devices, developer of these operating systems or owner of these distribution platforms wished to impair our ability to serve ads on them, our Zedge app\u2019s ability to generate revenues could be significantly harmed. Also, technologies may be developed that can block the display of our Zedge app\u2019s ads. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by our Zedge app\u2019s advertisers in connection with the display of ads. As a result, ad-blocking technology could materially adversely affect our business, revenues and profitability.\nCertain material functions related to our business depend on a single supplier to carry out our business, and the inability to do business with this supplier could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe depend on Google and its affiliated companies for multiple material functions related to our business, including advertising on our Zedge app and certain cloud services, and we expect to expand the services provided by Google in fiscal 2022. If the services of Google that we depend on were unavailable, or available only in decreased capacity or at less advantageous terms, this could result in interruptions to our ability to provide certain services, could cause reduction in service and/or quality as the function is transitioned to an alternate provider, if an alternate provider is available, or could increase our cost, which we may not be able to pass along to customers. Accordingly, any of these events could materially and negatively impact our business, our revenues, our profits, and our relationships with customers.\nIf technologies designed to block the display of advertisements or if in the future web browsers limit or block behavioral targeting technologies. our revenues may be adversely affected.\nOur apps and Emojipedia may suffer negative consequences, including a material reduction of revenue, with mass adoption of website ad blocking technologies or other technologies that limit the ability to personalize advertisements, including, without limitation, if the price for this advertising inventory declines.\nAlthough we had positive cash flow from operating activities and net earnings in fiscal 2021, we had previously incurred, and may once again incur, net losses and experience negative cash flow from operating activities in the future and may not be able to obtain additional capital in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur net income in fiscal 2021 was $8.2 million compared to net loss of $0.6 million in and fiscal 2020. Our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flow from operating activities depends on various factors, including but not limited to, the acceptance of our products and services by mobile phone and internet users, the growth and maintenance of our user base, our ability to maintain existing and obtain new advertisers, our ability to grow our revenues, the success of Zedge Premium and paid subscriptions, and the effectiveness of our new product initiatives, selling and marketing activities as well as control our costs and expenses. We may not be able to sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operating activities, and any such positive cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash needs. As such, we may not be able to fund our operating expenses and expenditures out of cash flows, which would require us to utilize debt or equity financing which we may not be able to secure or which we may only secure on terms that are not favorable, which, which may result in significant dilution or voluntary or involuntary dissolution or liquidation proceeding of us and a total loss of your investment.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase your investment risk.\nWe have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Although we experienced impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 107% in fiscal 2021 our growth in fiscal 2020 was moderate and even declined in fiscal 2019. As part of the nascent mobile advertising industry, we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving industries, including the need to:\n\u00a7 maintain our reputation and build trust with our advertiser and developer clients;\n\u00a7 offer competitive pricing to both advertisers and developers;\n\u00a7 maintain and expand our network of advertising space through which we deliver mobile advertising campaigns;\n\u00a7 deliver advertising results that are superior to those that advertisers or developers could achieve directly or through the use of competing providers or technologies;\n\u00a7 continue to develop and upgrade the technologies that enable us to provide mobile advertising services;\n\u00a7 respond to evolving government regulations relating to the internet, telecommunications, privacy, direct marketing and advertising aspects of our business;\n\u00a7 identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and\n\u00a7 manage our expanding operations.\nIf we do not successfully address any or all of these risks, our business, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our various brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation important to the success of our business. Historically, we have not made material investments in this effort. We believe that a well-recognized and respected brand is important to increasing the number of users and enhancing our attractiveness to advertisers and business partners. Brand recognition and enhancement may directly affect our ability to maintain our market position.\nMany factors, some of which are beyond our control, are important to maintaining and enhancing our various brands and may negatively impact our brand and reputation if not properly managed, such as our ability to:\n\u00a7 maintain an easy and reliable user experience as user preferences evolve and as our brands expand into new service categories and new service lines;\n\u00a7 remain relevant to users with a plethora of other content offerings and entertainment platforms;\n\u00a7 increase brand awareness among existing and potential users, advertisers and content providers through various marketing and promotional activities;\n\u00a7 adopt new technologies or adapt its products and services to meet user needs or emerging industry standards; and\n\u00a7 distinguish it from the competition and maintain this distinction.\nIn the future, we may conduct various marketing and brand promotion activities to expand our brand. Some of these may require material investment. We cannot assure you, however, that these activities will be successful or that we will be able to achieve the brand promotion effect we expect. In addition, any negative publicity in relation to our mobile internet products, websites or services could harm our brand and reputation.\nWe have received, and expect to continue to receive, complaints from users regarding the quality of our products and services. If our users\u2019 complaints are not addressed to their satisfaction, our reputation and our market position could be significantly harmed, which may materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and profitability.\nWe may not be able to continually meet our users\u2019 demands and retain or expand our user base, and our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we constantly monitor and research our users\u2019 demands, we may be unable to meet them on an ongoing basis or anticipate future user needs. A decrease in the number of users engaging with our products and services may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to sell advertising and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to attract and retain users and remain competitive, we must continue to innovate our products and services, improve user experience, and implement new technologies and functionalities.\nThe internet business is characterized by constant changes, including but not limited to rapid technological evolution, continual shifts in user demands, frequent introductions of new products and services and constant emergence of new industry standards and practices. As a result, our Zedge users may leave us for our competitors\u2019 products and services more quickly than in other sectors. Thus, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective basis, including improving and marketing our existing products and services and developing and pricing new products and services in response to evolving user needs. Our ability to successfully retain or expand our user base will depend on our ability to achieve the following, among others:\n\u00a7 anticipate and effectively respond to the growing number of internet users in general and our users in particular;\n\u00a7 attract, retain and motivate talented application designers, product managers and engineers who have experience developing personalization products or other mobile internet products and services;\n\u00a7 effectively market our existing and new mobile internet products in response to evolving user needs;\n\u00a7 develop in a timely fashion and launch new products and features, and develop and launch other internet products cost-effectively;\n\u00a7 funnel our existing users and prospects into new products that we develop, independent of our current product suite, and convert them into recurring users of these new products;\n\u00a7 successfully recruit new artists, individual creators and brands that offer their content to our Zedge app\u2019s users;\n\u00a7 attract and retain writers and actors for Shortz;\n\u00a7 further improve our Zedge app platform to provide a compelling and optimal user experience through integration of products and services provided by existing and new third-party developers or business partners; and\n\u00a7 continue to provide quality content to attract and retain our users and advertisers.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing products and services, including our Zedge app and Emojipedia, will remain sufficiently popular with our users. We may be unsuccessful in adding compelling new enhancements; products and services to further diversify these product offerings. Unexpected technical, commercial or operational problems could delay or prevent the introduction of one or more of our new products or services to our users. Moreover, we cannot be sure that any of our new products and services, including Zedge Premium, our subscription offering, Shortz or Emojipedia, will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenue the way our existing Zedge app\u2019s products and services have. If we fail to continue to achieve sufficient user satisfaction through our products or services or if our products and services fail to meet our expectation to maintain and expand our user base, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur marketplace for premium content, called Zedge Premium, may not yield the strategic goals and objectives that we envision, and our revenues, profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely negatively affected.\nOur marketplace where we charge our users for premium content in our Zedge app is called Zedge Premium. Although we believe that Zedge Premium will act as an important driver in helping our Zedge app become a leading platform for professional artists, individual creators and brands looking to distribute their work to consumers looking for an easy, entertaining and unique way to express their voice, individuality and essence, it\u2019s premature to conclude this as being the case.\nZedge Premium\u2019s gross transaction revenue has been growing slowly, but it is still too early to state with conviction that Zedge Premium will have a materially positive impact on our business. In order to do so, we still need, among other things, to:\n\u00a7 demonstrate that a critical mass of artists, individual creators and brands will offer their content to our Zedge app\u2019s users;\n\u00a7 continue to add new premium content verticals, with ample content in each vertical, to secure end-user demand and consumption;\n\u00a7 continue to ensure that our Zedge app is building best-of-breed tools for content contributors in Zedge Premium that, amongst other things, meet their needs with respect to marketing, distribution, monetization, reporting, support, and ease of use;\n\u00a7 continue to develop a wide array of monetization mechanisms for Zedge Premium in order to optimize revenue generation;\n\u00a7 successfully market to the creative community and secure their adoption of our Zedge Premium platform as a must-have in their omnichannel distribution mix;\n\u00a7 establish that Zedge Premium can be valuable to a sufficient number of creators in achieving their marketing and monetization objectives; and\n\u00a7 continue to offer an excellent and differentiated consumer experience in Zedge Premium, including all end-user facing attributes ranging from the user interface to customer support.\nIf Zedge Premium fails to yield the strategic goals and objectives that we envision, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Zedge app\u2019s user base is heavily weighted to the Android operating system and our revenues and profitability may suffer if the market demand for Android smartphones decreases.\nOur Zedge app\u2019s user base is heavily weighted to smartphones running the Android operating system, which constituted approximately 96% of its MAU as of July 31, 2021, and most of our revenues for fiscal 2021. Any significant downturn in the overall demand for Android smartphones or the use of Android smartphones could significantly and adversely affect the demand for our Zedge app and would materially affect our revenues.\nAlthough the Android smartphone market has grown rapidly in recent years, it is uncertain whether the Android smartphone market will continue growing at a similar rate in the future. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of the smartphone industry, another operating system for smartphones may eclipse the Android operating system and result in a decline in its popularity, which would likely adversely affect our Zedge app\u2019s popularity. To the extent that our Zedge app continues to be operated on Android smartphones and to the extent that our future revenues substantially depend on the use and sales of Android smartphones, our business and financial results would be vulnerable to any downturns in the Android smartphone market.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth or implement our future business strategies, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to grow each of the properties in our brand portfolio.\nWe may not be capable of growing our Zedge apps organically, attract new artists and establish cooperation with strategic partners. Our Zedge app has experienced periods of rapid growth and expansion that has placed, and continues to place, significant strain on our management and resources. We cannot assure you that these periods will recur or be sustainable. We believe that continued growth of our Zedge app will depend on our ability to develop and enhance its products and services, attract new artists and individual creators, grow its user base, retain existing users, continue developing innovative technologies in response to user demand, increase brand awareness through marketing and promotional activities, react to changes in market trends, expand into new market segments, attract new advertisers, retain existing advertisers and take advantage of the growth in the relevant markets. We cannot assure you that our Zedge app will achieve any or all of the above.\nWe may not be successful in increasing the number of users that engage with Emojipedia, maintain our relationship with various content partners like Google, Twitter and Apple or sustain our high rankings with the leading search engines including Google. We believe the Emojipedia\u2019s continued success depends on our ability to invest in product initiatives like localization, provide newsworthy and value-added information and capture the changes that are taking place in the industry in a timely fashion. In the event that we are not successful in some or all of these areas we may not be able to retain our customers and advertisers.\nWe may need to invest in paid user acquisition in order to grow our Zedge\u2019s customer base. However, we may not be able to secure new users at scale with a positive return on investment. Even if we can secure new profitable customers these new customers may be seasonal and/or unsustainable.\nTo manage our Zedge app\u2019s growth and for us to attain and maintain profitability, we will also need to further expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce and manage our relationships with users, consultants, business partners and advertisers. We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of enhanced and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems. All of these endeavors involve risks and will require substantial management efforts and skills and additional expenditures.\nOur Zedge app and Emojipedia currently enjoy a global customer base. This geographic diversification may raise the level of difficulty in managing their future growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our growth or implement our future business strategies effectively, and failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDuring the past five years, we have experienced a shift in our Zedge app\u2019s regional customer make-up with MAU increasing in the emerging markets and decreasing in the well-developed markets. In fiscal 2021, our Zedge app\u2019s users in the emerging markets grew by 16.1% while its users in the well-developed regions declined 11.5% when compared to fiscal 2020. India comprised 25% of our MAU as of July 31, 2021. This shift has negatively impacted revenues because the well-developed markets command materially higher advertising rates when compared to those in the emerging markets. Although we are investing in reversing this trend, we may not be successful in this effort which may result in lower revenues and profitability.\nOur products may contain errors, flaws or failures that may only become apparent after their release, especially in updates to our Zedge app. From time to time, we receive user feedback in connection with errors, flaws or failures and such errors, flaws or failures may also come to our attention during our internal testing process. We generally have been able to resolve such errors, flaws or failures in a timely manner, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to detect and resolve all of them effectively or in a timely manner. Errors, flaws or failures in our services and products, including our Zedge app, may adversely affect user experience and cause our users to stop using our services and products, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to convert freemium users into paying subscribers or maintain paying subscribers for more than a year.\nMuch of our growth in our Zedge\u2019s app\u2019s MAU since January 2019 is attributable to offering a paid subscription option which is weighted to securing annual prepaid subscriptions. In addition, approximately, 45% of annual subscribers have renewed their subscription for a second year while approximately 60% of those subscribers have renewed their subscription for a third year. Depending on the success of our product, the evolution of subscriptions and items beyond our control users may opt not to convert into paying subscribers and/or paying subscribers may choose not to renew their subscriptions. Either of these would adversely impact the business. During the second half of fiscal 2021, active subscription numbers were flat as new subscriptions were offset by cancellations during the period. This trend may continue into future periods.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with our advertisers, and we may be unable to retain existing advertisers, attract new advertisers or replace departing advertisers with advertisers that can provide comparable revenues to us, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 80% of our revenues were generated from our Zedge app selling advertising inventory. We anticipate that our growth and profitability will continue to depend on our ability to effectively sell and optimize our advertising inventory. Our success requires us to maintain and expand our current advertiser relationships and to develop new relationships.\nOur contracts with our Zedge app\u2019s and Emojipedia\u2019s advertising partners generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our inventory and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. Furthermore, the majority of our advertisers buy our inventory via third-party platforms and bidding exchanges that own the relationship with the advertiser. As a result, we may have limited visibility as to our future advertising revenue streams.\nWe cannot assure you that advertisers will continue to purchase our inventory, or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing advertisers with new advertisers that generate comparable revenue. If one or more major advertisers representing a significant portion of our business decide to materially reduce its advertising spend with us or cease purchasing our Zedge app\u2019s advertising inventory, our revenues and profitability could be significantly reduced.\nFurthermore, MoPub, a fully owned division of Twitter, has been our ad mediation platform for the past ten years and is in the process of being purchased by AppLovin a provider of advanced tools for mobile app developers to grow their businesses by automating and optimizing the marketing and monetization of their apps. In the event that this transaction closes it is possible that MoPub\u2019s mediation platform will be deprecated requiring us to migrate to a different mediation platform. This will not only require resource and time investment, which may slow down are ability to deliver other product initiatives but may also negatively impact the demand for and pricing of our advertising inventory.\nOur products face competition in all aspects of its business. If our Zedge app fails to compete effectively or if its reputation is damaged, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough our Zedge app is currently a leading platform for smartphone personalization end Emojipedia is a leading provider for emoji related content and information, we cannot guarantee that either of these properties will be able to maintain their leadership position. Both of these properties face potential competition from other internet companies, app developers and smartphone manufacturers, and new market entrants may also emerge. If we are not able to differentiate our products from that of our competitors, drive value for our customers, and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. Increased competition may result in new products and offerings which may in turn require us to take actions to retain and attract our users and advertisers in such a fashion which would lower our gross margins. If we fail to compete effectively, our market share would decrease and our results from operations, revenues and profits would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Zedge app in the midst of expanding beyond mobile phone personalization and focusing on becoming a distribution platform for professional artists, individual creators and brands interested in offering their content to consumers that are looking for an easy, entertaining and unique way of using this content to express their voice, individuality and essence. We aspire to have our Zedge app be the destination that smartphone users turn to when looking for mobile optimized, digital content. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our goal, our brand may suffer resulting in diluting our value proposition, losing MAU and having lower revenues and profits.\nIf we are not able to effectively compete in any aspect of our business or if our reputation is harmed by rumors or allegations regarding our business or business practices, our overall user base may decline, making it less attractive to advertisers. We may be required to spend additional resources to further increase our brand recognition and promote our products and services, and such additional spending could adversely affect our profitability.\nIf we fail to keep up with rapid technological changes in the internet and smartphone industries and adapt our products and services accordingly, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\nThe internet and smartphone industries are characterized by rapid and innovative technological changes. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to fast changing technologies, adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and improve the performance, functionality and reliability of our products and services. Our failure to continue to adapt to such changes could harm our business. If we are slow to develop products and services that are compatible with smartphones, or if the products and services we develop are not widely accepted and used by smartphone users, we may not be able to capture a significant share of this important market. In addition, the widespread adoption of new internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes for smartphones could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our products, services or infrastructure. If we fail to keep up with rapid and innovative technological changes to remain competitive, our future growth may be materially and adversely affected and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur international operations and availability expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to uncertainty about our ability to continue expanding and monetizing internationally, there are additional risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u00a7 tariffs, trade barriers, customs classifications and changes in trade regulations. For example, in May 2019, the United Stated banned U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, a major smartphone manufacturer, the result of which is that our Zedge app will not be available on new Huawei phones, and in 2020 the United States threatened to ban TikTok from the U.S. market;\n\u00a7 difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u00a7 stringent local labor laws and regulations;\n\u00a7 strict and unclear laws around data privacy;\n\u00a7 longer payment cycles;\n\u00a7 credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u00a7 profit repatriation restrictions and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u00a7 political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;\n\u00a7 geopolitical events, including natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism;\n\u00a7 import or export regulations;\n\u00a7 compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting bribery and corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u00a7 antitrust and competition regulations;\n\u00a7 potentially adverse tax developments;\n\u00a7 seasonal volatility in business activity and local economic conditions;\n\u00a7 economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt;\n\u00a7 laws, regulations, licensing requirements, and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership or investments;\n\u00a7 laws, regulations or rulings that block or limit access to our products;\n\u00a7 different, uncertain or more stringent user protection, content, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and other laws; and\n\u00a7 risks related to other government regulation, required compliance with local laws or lack of legal precedent.\nWe are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that increase our cost of doing business. Violations of these complex laws and regulations that apply to our international operations could result in damages, awards, fines, litigation, criminal actions, sanctions, or penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and our ability to offer products and services, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies or that our policies will be sufficient. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and could result in material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nCompanies and governmental agencies may restrict access to our website or mobile apps, or the internet generally, which could lead to the loss or slower growth of our user base, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn order to grow our business, users need to access the internet and, in particular, our digital products. Companies and governmental agencies could block access to our websites and apps or the internet generally. For example, in 2013 the Indian courts issued orders restraining internet service providers from providing access to various internet domains including ours. Access to our Zedge app through any mode was blocked in many parts of India from February 2013 until August 2019 as discussed more fully in the Legal Proceedings section below and there can be no guaranties that this will not recur or happen elsewhere. If companies or governmental entities block or limit access to our Zedge app or otherwise adopt policies restricting access to our advertiser\u2019s products and services our business could be negatively impacted resulting in a loss or slow-down of user growth and/or revenues.\nOur core values of focusing on our users and acting for the long-term may conflict with the short-term interests of our business.\nOne of our core values is a focus on our users\u2019 experience, which we believe is essential to our success and serves the best, long-term interests of us and our stockholders. Therefore, we have made, in the past and/or may make in the future, significant investments or changes in strategy that we think will benefit our users, even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the short term. In addition, our philosophy of prioritizing our users may cause disagreements or negatively impact our relationships with advertisers or other third parties. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case the success of our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are required to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Likewise, we are required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2021, we reported that we had a material weakness related to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets (see Item 9A Control and Procedures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Notwithstanding the material weakness described above, we have performed additional analyses and other procedures to enable management to conclude that our financial statements included in this Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended July 31, 2021. Remediation of these weaknesses had not yet been completed, and therefore these deficiencies continued to exist as of November 3, 2021. Management and our Audit Committee will monitor remedial measures and the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures.\nWhile we aim to work diligently to ensure a robust internal control that is devoid of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses, given the complexity of the accounting rules, we may, in the future, identify additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under Section 404. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price. See Item 9A Controls and Procedures for a further discussion of our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nAlthough we believe that our remediation efforts will strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting and address the concern that gave rise to the material weakness as of July 31, 2021, we cannot be certain that our expanded knowledge and revised internal control practices will ensure that we maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The New York Stock Exchange, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nLegal proceedings or allegations of impropriety could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to allegations or lawsuits by entities claiming that we engage in unethical, fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate business practices. Any such lawsuit or allegation, with or without merit, or any perceived unfair, unethical, fraudulent or inappropriate business practice by us or perceived wrong-doing by any key member of our management team could harm our reputation and user base and distract our management from our day-to-day operations. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to lawsuits or allegations in the future. When we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that an adverse liability resulting from such litigation is probable, we will record a related contingent liability. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate.\nIn fiscal years 2020 and 2021, we did not record any contingent liabilities relating to pending litigation. When we record or revise our estimates of contingent liabilities in the future, the amount of our estimates may be inaccurate due to the inherent uncertainties relating to litigation. In addition, the outcomes of actions we institute against third parties may not be successful or favorable to us. Litigations and allegations against us may also generate negative publicity that significantly harms our reputation, which may materially and adversely affect our user base and our ability to attract publishers and advertisers. In addition to the related cost, managing and defending litigation and related indemnity obligations can significantly divert management\u2019s and the board of directors\u2019 attention from operating our business. We may also need to pay damages or settle the litigation with a substantial amount of cash or equity. All of these could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation and cash flows.\nA variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign government laws and regulations could subject us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or the interpretation of them, our introduction of new products, or an extension of our business into new areas, could increase our future compliance costs, make our products and services less attractive to our users, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. We may incur substantial expenses to comply with laws and regulations or defend against a claim that we have not complied with them. Further, any failure on our part to comply with any relevant laws or regulations may subject us to significant civil or criminal liabilities, penalties, taxes, fees, costs and negative publicity.\nThe application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations to us relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, security, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, consumer protection, accessibility, content regulation, quality of services, law enforcement demands, telecommunications, mobile, and intellectual property ownership and infringement in many instances is unclear or unsettled. Further, the application to us or our subsidiaries of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers can be unclear. U.S. export control laws and regulations also impose requirements and restrictions on exports to certain nations and persons and on our business. Internationally, we may also be subject to laws regulating our activities in foreign countries and to foreign laws and regulations that are inconsistent from country to country.\nOn July 16, 2020, rulings from the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a lawful means for transferring personal data from the European Economic Area, or the EEA, or the United Kingdom to the United States The court upheld that the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, can act as a valid transfer mechanism for personal data transfer, but that additional measures may be required to ensure adequate protection of personal data. To rely on SCCs, a data exporter must verify that the jurisdiction in which the data importer is based offers adequate protection for personal data. Data exporters may also need to put in place additional measures to deal with any risks associated with data transfer, such as technical controls and additional contractual obligations on how to manage onward transfers and compelled disclosures to public authorities. Undertaking such assessments and implementing additional measures could restrict our business operations and require us to incur additional costs for compliance.\nFollowing the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, have been incorporated directly into UK law as the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d. In practice, there is little change to the core data protection principles, rights and obligations under UK data protection law. On June 28 2021, the EU approved the United Kingdom\u2019s adequacy decision, meaning data can continue to flow between the United Kingdom and EEA as it did prior to Brexit, in most circumstances. There is a possibility that the United Kingdom may adopt regulations that diverge from the EU and that require a different compliance regime and that carry different penalties in the event of a breach which could increase our future compliance costs.\nIn addition to the actual and potential changes to laws and regulations described elsewhere in these Risk Factors, compliance with privacy and data security regulations, particularly within the EU, is likely to require ongoing investment and changes in how we operate. For example, in May 2018 the EU implemented the GDPR, whose goal is to provide a uniform standard for data protection and privacy for all individuals in the EU and EEA, including both end-users and employees. GDPR compliance required us to invest a considerable amount of resources in fiscal 2018 in addition to adopting new operational procedures in order to assure ongoing compliance. In 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which is a privacy law that provides consumers significant rights over the use of their personal information, including the right to object to the \u201csale\u201d of their personal information. Amendments to the CCPA under the California Privacy Rights Act which will take effect in 2023 expand some of the CCPA rights to residents to restrict the use of certain information. These rights may restrict our ability to use personal information in connection with our business operations. The CCPA also provides a private right of action for security breaches. Colorado and Virginia have passed privacy bills similar to the CCPA which will go into effect in 2023. Washington, Massachusetts and other states have introduced privacy bills and the U.S. Congress is debating federal privacy legislation, which if passed, may restrict our business operations and require us to incur additional costs for compliance. While we carefully consider the compliance mandates of the GDPR and CCPA, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our business practices.\nIn addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for hosting user-generated materials that infringe copyrights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements in the DMCA. Also, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, provides immunity from liability for providers of an interactive computer service who publish defamatory information provided by users of the service. While the immunity provisions of the DMCA and the CDA are well established, there are regular cases seeking to limit the application of such immunity. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, every state has passed a law requiring notification, and at times, the provision of identity theft protection, to users when there is a security breach for personal data. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.\nIn many, but not all, territories outside of the United States there are laws similar to the DMCA which exempt us from copyright infringement liability that may arise due to hosting user-uploaded materials. In some countries, particularly in Europe and the APAC region, these laws are being readjusted and new - at times burdensome - constraints are being imposed onto service providers.\nIn June 2019, the European Union\u2019s Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, or the Directive, came into effect, and each of the European Union\u2019s member were supposed to have implemented the Directive by June 2021. To date seven EU Member States (including Germany, the Netherlands, Croatia, Malta, France, Italy and Hungary).\nDirective Article 17 removes the shield of the current \u2018hosting exemption\u2019, enshrined in the E-Commerce Directive, and replaces it with a principle of full liability where \u201conline content sharing service providers\u201d (\u201cOCSSPs\u201d) are concerned. This means that OCSSPs will be liable for copyright-protected material uploaded by users and must obtain authorization (i.e., a licence) from the relevant rightsholders. However, Article 17 effectively creates a new liability exemption regime for OCSSPs (albeit a more onerous one than is currently provided by the E-Commerce Directive) under which OCSSPs will not be liable for the copyright-protected works that they communicate to the public provided that they cooperate with rightholders by:\n\u00a7 making best efforts to obtain the necessary authorization (i.e., a licence);\n\u00a7 expeditiously taking down or disabling access to content upon receiving a sufficiently substantiated notice to do so by rightholders (i.e., similar to the existing \u2018notice and take-down\u2019 requirements);\n\u00a7 making best efforts to prevent future uploads of content in respect of which they have received a notice from rightholders pursuant to the previous requirement (i.e., a \u2018notice and stay down\u2019 requirement); and\n\u00a7 making best efforts, in accordance with high industry standards of professional diligence, to ensure the unavailability of specific works in respect of which rightsholders have provided the \u2018relevant and necessary information\u2019.\nThe article also extends any licenses granted to OCSSPs to their users, as long as those users are not acting \u201con a commercial basis\u201d.\nAlthough we have invested and continue to invest in systems and resources, which are intended to ensure that we are compliant with the requirements of the GDPR. CCPA, DMCA, the Directive and other U.S. and international laws relating to, among other things, materials that infringe on copyrights and contain other objectionable content, our systems may not be sufficient or we may unintentionally err and fail to comply with these laws and regulations which could expose us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to license, acquire or otherwise obtain access to compelling content and services at reasonable cost or if we do not develop or commission compelling content of our own, the number of users of our Zedge app may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, or users\u2019 level of engagement with our Zedge app may decline, all or any of which could materially harm our business and operating results.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to aggregate and host compelling content and deliver that content to our users via our products. We achieve this when users upload their own user-generated content to our Zedge app, when artists, individual creators and brands upload their licensed content to our Zedge app, or when we create content or enter into business partnerships with content owners and distribute this content on our Zedge app. For Shortz, we typically commissioning the content by paying a small upfront fee and sharing in the future revenues with the author of that content. In Emojipedia\u2019s case, we usually receive new emojis from the content owner while paying authors to write articles on our blog.\nWe believe that users value high-quality content. As such, we may need to make substantial payments to third parties from whom we license or acquire such content or from whom we have create this content on our behalf. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with such third-party providers may become important to our success. As competition for compelling content increases both domestically and internationally, our partners may alter business terms under which they avail their content and services to us and potential providers may not offer their content or services to us at all, or may offer them on terms that are not agreeable to us. A change in these commercial terms could harm our operating results and financial condition. Further, much of the content that we acquire may only be available on a non-exclusive basis allowing competitors the ability of offering this content to our disadvantage.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could require us to pay substantial statutory penalties or other damages and fines, remove relevant content, enter into license agreements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or could result in our being barred from third-party distribution platforms, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nThere may be owners of technology patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and content, who assert claims against us. If a claim of infringement is brought against us, we may be required to pay substantial penalties or other damages and fines, remove relevant content, enter into license agreements that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or be barred from any of the third-party distribution platforms. Even though the allegations or claims could be baseless, our defense against any of these allegations or claims would be both costly and time-consuming and could significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management and other personnel.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Such employees, particularly product managers, designers and engineers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause additional disruptions to our business.\nAt the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we implemented a modest reduction in workforce, primarily in Norway. This action may have impacted employee morale and led, or may lead, to higher rates of voluntary attrition compared to prior years. If we are unable to retain and attract qualified employees, particularly in critical areas of operations such as engineering, we may not achieve our strategic goals and our business and operations could be harmed.\nIn August of 2018 we opened a development center in Vilnius, Lithuania in order to diversify our talent pool with a qualified and more affordable talent base. If we are unable to recruit and retain well qualified candidates at an attractive rate or manage them well, our business will struggle to meet its development goals and objectives. We were successful in ramping up the recruitment and hiring in fiscal 2020 and ended the fiscal year with a team of 16 engineers product managers, operations professionals and designers. In August 2020, we moved to a serviced office space which provides maximum flexibility during the pandemic. In March 2021 our Trondheim, Norway office executed a new lease for a smaller location which we moved into in April. In fiscal 2021 we adopted a \u201cremote-first\u201d work policy that enables employees to work from home unless they are needed in the office. This policy has been well received by employees.\nWe believe that two critical components of our success are our ability to retain our best people by preserving our culture and maintaining competitive compensation practices. As we continue to grow rapidly, and we develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition, some of our employees are able to receive material proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could materially harm our business and competitive position.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, patents, domain names, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark and patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary right. As of July 31, 2021, we have registered, amongst others, the following domain names: www.zedge.net and www.zedge.com. In addition, we have been granted trademark protection for \u201cZedge\u201d in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, India, and Canada and for \u201cTonesync\u201d in the European Union and the United Kingdom, and \u201cWe Make Phones Personal\u201d and \u201cShortz - Chat Stories by Zedge\u201d in the United States, and have obtained a copyright registration for our flagship app, Zedge. In addition, we have registered, amongst others, the following domain names: www.zedge.net and www.zedge.com.\nOn August 1, 2021, we acquired Emojipedia. As part of this acquisition, we acquired trademark registrations for \u201cEmojipedia\u201d in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and Australia, and trademark registrations for \u201cWorld Emoji Day\u201d in the United States and United Kingdom. We also acquired the following domain name registrations: www.emojipedia.com and www.emojipedia.org.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that we can effectively prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and may not be successful.\nIn addition, it is often difficult to create and enforce intellectual property rights in certain international markets. Patents, trademarks and service marks may also be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Trade secrets are difficult to protect, and our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. Confidentiality agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Even where adequate and relevant laws exist it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of such laws, or to obtain enforcement of a court judgment or an arbitration award delivered in another jurisdiction, and accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or enforce agreements in such countries\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies necessary to deliver content, advertising, and services to our users, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or acceptance of these formats and technologies could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur service and hosting providers may experience downtime from time to time, which may negatively affect our brand and user perception of the reliability of our service. Any scheduled or unscheduled interruption of our Zedge app could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Although we seek to reduce the possibility of disruptions or other outages, our websites and apps may be disrupted by problems relating either to our own technology or third-party technology that is used for them. Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from telecommunication failures, power loss, computer attacks or viruses, earthquakes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks and similar events. Parts of our system are not fully redundant or backed up, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Despite any precaution we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our products. Any interruption in the ability of users to access our websites or apps could reduce our future revenues, harm our future profits, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and lead users to seek alternative internet mobile products.\nThere can be no assurance that these providers will continue licensing their technologies or intellectual property to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Providers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of their technologies. Any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or user acceptance of these technologies could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and profitability.\nIn October 2021 AppLovin a provider of advanced tools for mobile app developers to grow their businesses by automating and optimizing the marketing and monetization of their apps announced that subject to regulatory approval that they were purchasing MoPub, a fully owned division of Twitter. MoPub has been our ad mediation platform for the past ten years. In the event that this transaction closes it is possible that MoPub\u2019s mediation platform will be deprecated requiring us to migrate to a different mediation platform. This will not only require resource and time investment, which may slow down are ability to deliver other product initiatives but may also negatively impact the demand for and pricing of our advertising inventory potentially resulting in lower revenue.\nWe use open source software in our platform that may subject our technology to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may cause materially harm to our business.\nWe use open source software in connection with our services. From time to time, companies that incorporate open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute or make available open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could nevertheless occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue use in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur business depends on our ability to collect and use data to deliver relevant content and advertisements, and any limitation on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose clients and revenues.\nWhen one uses our products and services, including our Zedge app, we may collect both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable data about the user. This may include but is not limited to the user\u2019s name, telephone number, email address, web cookies, Facebook and other login credentials, phone model, operating system, location, Android Advertising ID, the collection of apps running on the user\u2019s mobile device as well as information relating to their interaction with advertisements appearing within our products. Often we use some of this data to provide a better experience for the user by delivering both relevant content and advertisements. In addition, we use some of this data for advertising reporting purposes.\nAlthough our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service provide extensive details about how we use customer data our clients may decide not to allow us to collect some or all of this data or may limit our use of this data. Any limitation on our ability to collect data about user behavior and app interactions would likely make it more difficult for us to deliver germane content to our users and effective mobile advertising campaigns that meet the demands of our advertisers.\nOur contracts with advertisers generally permit us to aggregate data from advertising campaigns, yet these clients might nonetheless request that we discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have already been aggregated with other clients\u2019 campaign data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with these requests, and these kinds of requests could also cause us to invest significant amounts of resources. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions regarding the collection of data, could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze mobile device user data from our clients\u2019 advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our advertiser clients, which could make our services less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose clients and our revenues may materially decline.\nConcerns about collection and use of personal data could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services, which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nConcerns about products with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and results of operations. We apply strict management and protection of user-provided data and only use this data as described in our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. While we strive to comply with our Privacy Policy as well as all applicable data protection laws and regulations, including GDPR and soon to be the CCPA, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, and could damage our reputation. User and regulatory attitudes towards privacy are evolving, and future regulatory or user concerns about the extent to which personal information is used or shared with advertisers or others may adversely affect our ability to share certain data with advertisers, which may limit certain methods of targeted advertising. In addition, new regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation) could result in us having to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. For instance, U.S. courts have begun to define a level of reasonable security that is required when maintaining personal information, and such requirements could both increase our cost of operations and subject us to liability for failure to maintain such levels of security.\nData collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If internet and mobile customers were to reduce their use of our products, and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.\nConcerns about the security of personal data could also lead to a decline in general usage of our products and services, which could lead to lower user numbers. A significant reduction in user numbers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActivities of our advertiser clients could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.\nOur advertisers may not comply with federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to mobile communications. Failure of our clients to comply with federal, state or local laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third parties for content in the advertisements we deliver if the artwork, text or other content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. Although we generally receive assurance from our advertising partners that their advertisements are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property included in an advertisement, and although we are normally indemnified by the advertisers, a third party or regulatory authority may still file a claim against us. Any such claims could be costly and time consuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation within the mobile advertising industry. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability, we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend significant resources.\nSecurity breaches or computer virus attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and results of operations.\nAny significant breach of security of our computer systems could significantly harm our business, reputation and results of operations and could expose us to lawsuits brought by our users and partners and to sanctions by governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot assure you that our IT systems will be secure from future security breaches or computer virus attacks. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, including the personal information of our users, obtaining users\u2019 names and passwords and enabling the hackers to access user\u2019s other online and mobile accounts, if those users use identical usernames and passwords. They could also misappropriate other information, including our content. These circumventions may cause interruptions in our operations or damage our brand image and reputation. Our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could cause system interruptions, website slowdown or unavailability, delays in communication or transactions, or loss of data. We may be required to incur significant additional costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. In addition, a significant security breach or virus attack on our system could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe have granted, and may continue to grant, options, restricted shares and other types of awards under our stock option and equity incentive plans and otherwise, which may result in increased equity-based compensation expenses.\nThe expenses associated with equity-based compensation have affected our net income and may reduce our net income in the future, and any additional equity issued under equity-based compensation schemes will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. We believe the granting of equity-based compensation is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain key personnel and employees, consultants and directors, and we will continue to grant equity-based compensation in the future. As a result, our expenses associated with equity-based compensation may increase, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nInvestors may suffer dilution.\nWe may engage in equity financing to fund our future operations and growth or acquisitions. If we raise additional funds and/or provide consideration in acquisitions by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest (both with respect to the percentage of total securities held, and with respect to the book value of their securities) and such securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our Class B common stock.\nFor example, between December 14, 2020 and January 26, 2021, we sold 761,906 shares of our Class B common stock at an average price of $6.5625 per share for total proceeds of $5 million in a registered \u201cAt-the-Market\u201d offering through National Securities Corp. and H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC as sales agents. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including organic and other growth initiatives.\nIn addition, on March 16, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which contemplates the sale, for a gross aggregate sale price of up to $10,000,000, of shares of our Class B common stock, from time to time in \u201cAt-The-Market\u201d offerings pursuant to an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with National Securities Corporation and Maxim Group LLC dated as of March 16, 2021. Through June 11, 2021, we sold 663,686 shares at an average price of $15.0674 per share for total proceeds of $10 million in this offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including organic and other growth initiatives.\nAny such equity financing could occur at prices below, or well below, the then-current trading price of our Class B common stock, which would further exacerbate the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have significant operations in Europe that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Norwegian Kroner and Euro, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus these currencies impacts the expenses generated in these foreign currencies when converted into the U.S. Dollar. In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we recorded a loss of $2,000 and $152,000, respectively, from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. Dollar. Included in these amounts were losses from hedging activities of $18,000 and $218,000 in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, should we become an accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation.\nDuring the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, we may identify weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, and we may be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods, any of which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading price of our stock.\nAdditionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.\nFuture strategic alliances or acquisitions may not be successful and may have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances, including joint ventures or minority equity investments, or acquisitions with various third parties to further our business purpose from time to time. These alliances and acquisitions could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the third party and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties and, to the extent any of these strategic third parties suffers negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with any such third party.\nIn addition, if appropriate opportunities arise, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies or businesses that we believe are complementary to our existing business. Future acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own would require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant. In addition to possible stockholders\u2019 approval, we may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs.\nOur business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and communities in which we, our partners and customers operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant business and financial markets disruption worldwide and there is material uncertainty about the duration of this pandemic and its impact on the ongoing effects on our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic increase in unemployment that could result in interfering with freemium users converting into paid subscribers or in paid subscribers renewing their subscriptions because of the impact on discretionary spend. In addition, we may experience a decline in advertising.\nInitially the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our Zedge app\u2019s new user growth. New smartphone sales suffered as a result of retail business closures, negatively impacting new user growth, especially in well-developed markets. Assuming the retail business rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that our Zedge app\u2019s new user growth will also recover and we will benefit accordingly but there can no assurance of such rebound or new user growth. If new mobile device sales decrease or slowdown, our Zedge app will experience fewer installations which will negatively impact our revenue and operations.\nIn addition, in response to the spread of COVID-19, many of our employees have had to work from home which may negatively impact productivity and innovation. More generally, the COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our products.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had not experienced significant adverse impacts to our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, the situation remains fluid and we cannot predict with certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to obtain additional financing, may be adversely affected by downturn in the global economy.\nThe global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions over the past ten years and the recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009 has been uneven. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world\u2019s leading economies. There have also been concerns over unrest in the Middle East and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets. We may be affected by economic downturns. A prolonged slowdown in the world economy may lead to a reduced amount of mobile internet advertising, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, a slowdown or disruption in the global economy may have a material and adverse impact on financings available to us. The weakness in the economy could erode investor confidence, which constitutes the basis of the credit market. Turmoil affecting the financial markets and banking system may significantly restrict our ability to obtain financing in the capital markets or from financial institutions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe trading price of the shares of our Class B common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our Class B common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price could be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for mobile internet companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their Class B common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our Class B common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00a7 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00a7 changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u00a7 conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u00a7 stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that operate in the advertising, internet or media industries;\n\u00a7 announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions;\n\u00a7 strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u00a7 announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u00a7 changes to regulations including but not limited to, data privacy, and copyrighted content;\n\u00a7 capital commitments;\n\u00a7 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00a7 sales of our Class B common stock common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against technology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe are controlled by our majority stockholder, which limits the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nMichael Jonas is our majority stockholder, Executive Chairman, Chairman of the Board and a director, and, as of October 25, 2021, has voting power over 1,862,498 shares of our Class B common stock (which includes 524,775 shares of our Class A common stock, which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis, and 1,337,723shares of our Class B common stock), representing approximately 57.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Mr. Jonas is able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors and the approval of significant corporate matters, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management is limited.\nWe exercised our option for the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under NYSE American stock exchange rules with respect to our Nominating Committee.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide because more than 50% of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by a single stockholder. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are exempt from certain NYSE American rules requiring a board of directors with a majority of independent members, a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. These independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet those standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We applied this \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption for our corporate governance practices only with respect to the requirement of a Nominating Committee and we disbanded our Nominating Committee in fiscal 2020. Accordingly, with respect to our lack of a Nominating Committee you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American stock exchange, and if we were to apply the controlled company exemption to other independence requirements, you would not have the protection afforded by those requirements either.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common Class B common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by equity research analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our Class B common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our Class B common stock. In the event we do receive equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price and/or trading volume to decline.\nOur results of operations may be subject to wide fluctuations due to a number of factors, which may adversely affect the trading price of our Class B common stock.\nWe may experience seasonality and other fluctuations in our business, reflecting fluctuations in mobile internet and smartphone usage and advertising. Revenues from mobile application products and services are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the calendar year due to increased year-end advertising and marketing budgets. Conversely, we generally experience lower advertising revenues during the first quarter of the calendar year due to weaker advertising spend following the holidays. Thus, our operating results in one or more future quarters or years may fluctuate substantially or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such event, the trading price of our Class B common stock may fluctuate significantly or decrease significantly.", "PERMNO": 16049, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ZDGE"}
