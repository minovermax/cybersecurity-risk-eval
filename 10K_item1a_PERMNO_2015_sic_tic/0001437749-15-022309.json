{"cik": "1002037", "company": "LEARNING TREE INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties, keeping in mind that they are not the only ones that affect us. Additional risks that we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on us.\nPrice Fluctuations and Limited Market for Our Common Stock\nHistorically, our common stock price has fluctuated, and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future.\nGeneral Factors. We believe some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of our stock related to factors such as:\n\u2022\nvariations in our revenues, gross margins, earnings or other financial results;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning new products or enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions of new means of delivering training;\n\u2022\nintroductions of new technologies both by our customers and technology vendors; and\n\u2022\nlimited public float and low daily trading volume.\nIn addition, prices in the stock market, particularly for technology-related stocks, have been volatile in recent years. In some cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance.\nFuture Sales of Our Common Stock.\nSales of our common stock by our founders, officers, directors and employees could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of shares of our common stock. Additionally, the price could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons. In addition to the 13,224,349 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 1, 2015, as of that date, we are authorized to issue up to 850,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options, and an additional 281,850 shares of common stock remained available for issuance of equity awards under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. We cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock, or the potential for those sales, will have on our share price.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX US Market (OTCQX) and has a limited trading market.\nAs of July 23, 2015, the Company\u2019s common stock commenced being quoted on the OTCQX, and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX does not assure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX marketplace generally have limited trading volume and exhibit a wide spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our securities. This significantly limits the liquidity of the common stock, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. A limited market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using common stock as consideration.\nWe do not now, and are not expected to in the foreseeable future, meet the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national securities exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which may adversely impact the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is, and is expected to continue to be in the near term, less than $5.00 per share and, therefore, a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Brokers and dealers effecting transactions in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d must disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. Those rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell the Company\u2019s common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock. In addition, if our common stock continues to be quoted on the OTCQX as we expect, then our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations for our stock, and may find few buyers to purchase our stock and few market makers to support its price.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. These FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nLimited Liquidity\nWe have no outstanding debt or line-of-credit agreements. We anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on our balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations, and other financing available to us to finance our operating cash needs.\nDue to the absence of any outstanding debt or line-of-credit agreement to provide liquidity, any adverse impact on our operating results could impact our cash flows from operations and our ability to meet our operating cash needs. This would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price.\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated, and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future.\nFluctuations in our historical operating results have resulted from many factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the future, these or other factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause our stock price to decrease. For example:\nTiming of Course Development, and Sales and Marketing Expenditures. We try to adjust our expenditures for course development and sales and marketing to maintain our long-term profitability, including our assessment of the potential to influence future customer demand, market conditions, and other factors. This may mean accepting reduced margins in poor economic periods, as we must commit too much of our spending before our attendees enroll in our courses. If revenues fall short of our expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures quickly enough to compensate for lower than anticipated revenues. This could compound the impact of any revenue shortfall and further affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.\nCourse Scheduling and Marketing Activities. The timing and content of our courses and our marketing activities can affect the number of participants who attend our courses. Some of the activities that can contribute to fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe frequency of our course events;\n\u2022\nthe number of weeks during which our courses can be conducted in a quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing, timely delivery, frequency and size of, and the response to, our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introduction of new course titles;\n\u2022\nthe average length of courses, based on the current mix of course titles, which affects the average revenue per attendee; and\n\u2022\nthe mix between course events held at customer locations and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins.\nSeasonal Factors. Our quarterly revenues and income fluctuate due to the seasonal spending patterns of our customers, which are affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ncyclic or one-time budgetary considerations;\n\u2022\ngovernment spending and budget cycles;\n\u2022\nfactors specific to their business or industry; and\n\u2022\nweather, holiday and vacation considerations.\nUse of Accounting Estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions in calculating our financial results. As one example, we currently offer our customers a multiple-course sales discount referred to as a Training Passport, which allows an individual Passport holder to attend up to a specified number of Learning Tree courses over a one- to two-year period for a fixed price. For a Training Passport, the amount of revenue we recognize for each attendance in one of our courses is based upon the selling price of the Training Passport, the list price of the course taken, the average list price of all courses taken, and our estimate of the average number of courses a Passport holder will actually attend. After expiration of a Training Passport, we record the difference, if any, between the revenue previously recognized and the Training Passport selling price. We base our estimate of the average number of course events that a Training Passport holder will attend on historical trends. However, these historical trends may not accurately predict the actual number of course events that a Training Passport holder will attend in the future. If average Training Passport attendance rates were to increase, for example, we would have to make negative adjustments to our revenue, which could be significant. For a summary of some of our key accounting estimates, please see our \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets and changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial position. In fiscal year 2012, we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the United States due to current year and projected future pre-tax book losses. We continued to maintain this valuation allowance throughout fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015. Management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether any deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part, primarily with respect to projected taxable income. The estimate of future taxable income can never be predicted with certainty. It is derived from budgets and strategic business plans but is dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. Substantial variance of actual results from estimated future taxable profits, or changes in our estimate of future taxable profits, could lead to changes in deferred tax assets being realizable, and would require a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance. Our income tax provision could be significantly impacted by estimates surrounding our uncertain tax positions, decisions on repatriation of foreign earnings, and changes to our valuation allowance in future periods. As a result, we may not be able to use the full amount of our deferred tax assets and may be exposed to elevated tax rates or additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial position.\nChanging Regulation of Corporate Governance and Public Disclosure. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs incurred with ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed.\nIntroductions and Adoption of New Technology. Our customers tend to increase their training at times when new technology is being introduced. During periods when fewer new technologies are being introduced, demand for our training courses may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOther Factors. Other factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\ncompetitive forces within our current and anticipated future markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract customers and meet their expectations;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndifferences in the timing of our spending on the marketing of our courses, as well as the timing of our spending on the development of our courses and other areas; and\n\u2022\nexcess capacity and/or unused space in our education centers and/or administrative office facilities, and our ability to sublease or find other uses for it.\nAll or any of these and similar factors could cause our operating results to differ substantially from the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price.\nRisks Associated with Technology Changes\nIf we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nChanges in technology can affect our business in at least two principal ways. First, we must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and other information technologies and develop courses that effectively train customers in the technologies they use now and will use in the future. Second, we must adapt to changes in the technologies by which we can deliver training to our customers\u2019 employees. As a result of technology developments, we may have to make substantial and unanticipated expenditures to develop new course titles, buy new equipment, or invest in further course development software and processes to deliver our courses. Further, we may not adequately anticipate or respond successfully to technology changes for many reasons, including misjudging the impact of technology changes, as well as financial, technological or other constraints. A lack of adequate response on our part to changes in information technology platforms, customer preferences or software technology could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nWe are moving our corporate operations center and may experience technological issues.\nIn December 2015, our company will be moving its operations center, including its core IT operations, to its new corporate location as well as integrating new technology. We may experience adverse technological issues in completing the move of our operations center that would adversely impact our operations and our ability to conduct business, including telephone and internet service.\nCompetition\nIf our customers decide that they prefer training offered by new or existing competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nThe IT and management training markets are highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry. No single competitor holds a dominant market share. We face intense competition from both established entities and new entries in the market. Our primary competitors include:\n\u2022\ninternal training departments within our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\ncomputer hardware and software vendors and their Authorized Training and Education Center partners;\n\u2022\nindependent education and training companies;\n\u2022\nacademic providers; and\n\u2022\nsoftware systems integrators.\nSome of our competitors offer course titles and programs similar to ours at lower prices. In addition, some competitors have greater financial and other resources than us. Additionally, hardware and software vendors, as well as software systems integrators, may combine IT education and training with sales of their products or other services, which could allow them to offer training at lower prices than we do. Furthermore, future consolidation of IT vendors or training companies could have a material impact on our future operations.\nThe risk of outsourcing of corporate IT administration and software development overseas to countries or firms not currently served by us could have a material adverse impact on our future operations.\nAlthough instructor-led classroom training continues to dominate the worldwide IT and management training markets, technology-based education and training formats, such as Internet-based distance learning, have gained some acceptance. Accordingly, our future results may also depend on the extent to which the market will continue to accept instructor-led IT and management training and on our ability to develop and market instructor-led courses that compete effectively against technology-based courses offered by our competitors.\nRisks Associated with International Operations\nApproximately 40% of our annual revenue is generated by courses conducted outside the United States. Therefore, if we do not adequately anticipate and respond to the risks inherent in international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars, while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies. Consequently, changes in exchange rates can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results and could result in exchange losses. We do not hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates. Even if we were to use hedging techniques in the future, we might not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of currency fluctuations. Thus, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nOther Risks Associated with International Operations. Additionally, our results of operations may be adversely affected by other international risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in translating our courses into foreign languages;\n\u2022\ninternational political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in and/or compliance with government regulation in various countries;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing our foreign offices, and in training and retaining foreign instructors;\n\u2022\nadverse income tax and transfer pricing consequences; and\n\u2022\npotential costs associated with expansion into new territories or withdrawing from a territory.\nWe expect that international revenues will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenues. A lack of anticipation and response to the risks associated with international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers, our senior managers and other key personnel. The loss of these people, especially without advance notice, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. It is also very important that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including course instructors, to accommodate growth, new course titles and to replace personnel who leave. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, especially in information technology industries and/or in certain geographic areas, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions, we could be unable to recruit, train and retain instructors and employees. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nOur business depends largely on our ability to utilize knowledgeable instructors at our various locations.\nOur business is based on successfully attracting and utilizing professional instructors with the knowledge and ability to effectively deliver our course materials to participants. Because we deliver course events at multiple locations throughout the world, we rely on some of our instructors to travel to such locations to teach our courses. If we are not able to timely send our instructors to locations due to restrictive immigration laws or otherwise, then we may incur additional costs in delivering the course event or face limitations in the local and number of course events we present internationally.\nRisks Associated with Intellectual Property\nEvents outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products and services.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our courses are delivered. We cannot be certain that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar course titles or delivery methods unencumbered by our proprietary rights. If substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. We may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others, or have to pursue claims to protect our proprietary rights. Defending against and prosecuting these claims is costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf substantial unauthorized use of our courses occurs or if we must defend against infringement claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and confidential information. Our course development process and course titles are proprietary and we rely primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, customer licensing agreements, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights. Our course materials generally do not include any mechanisms to prohibit or prevent unauthorized use. As a result, someone could copy or otherwise obtain and use our course materials without authorization, either for educational use or to develop competing courses. In addition, we operate in countries that do not provide protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States. Finally, our intellectual property rights will not prevent competitors from independently developing similar course titles or delivery methods. If substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur, our results of operations and price of our common stock could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others. If such a claim succeeded, we might have to change or eliminate courses and could be required to pay damages or royalties. In addition, litigation over intellectual property rights, whether brought by us or by someone else, could be time-consuming and expensive, even if we were ultimately to succeed. Accordingly, defending and prosecuting these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Changes in patent law, foreign or domestic, may have an impact on our ability to obtain patent protections. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees or former employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nRisks Associated with Laws and Regulations\nChanges to laws and regulations can affect our operations and may limit our ability to operate in certain states and foreign jurisdictions or adversely impact our operating results.\nProviders of educational programs to the public must comply with many laws and regulations of Federal, state and international governments. Generally, we are exempt from this type of regulation because we contract with the employer of the participants in our courses, and we do not participate in any Federal, state or foreign student aid or loan programs. However, changes to state and foreign laws and regulations targeting educational providers could affect our operations in the future and could limit our ability to obtain authorization to operate in certain states. If we were found in violation of a state\u2019s or foreign jurisdiction\u2019s current or future licensing or regulatory requirements, then we could be subject to civil or criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, and we could also be barred from providing educational services in that state or foreign jurisdiction. In addition, laws and regulatory decisions in many areas other than education could also adversely affect our operations. Complying with current or future legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nWe are subject to tax audits by state, Federal and foreign jurisdictions. Such audits are to be expected and may result in adjustments as a result of the accretion of tax jurisdiction interpretations and changes in operational practices. Any such audits may result in additional taxes being assessed or in the refund of taxes previously paid. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nRisks Associated with Cyber Security\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personal identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nDependence on Key Vendors\nInterruptions of services or support from our key vendors could result in an adverse impact to our operations and financial results.\nWe are reliant on key vendors for technical services and support. Any interruption of these services and/or support for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.\nControl by Management\nOur Chairman and Founder beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding shares, and therefore could have significant influence over our policies and affairs and is in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions.\nAs of December 1, 2015, Dr. Collins, our Chairman of the Board of Directors beneficially owned (including shares owned with his wife, Mary Collins, a director of the Company) approximately 56.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Consequently, Dr. Collins and Mary Collins have significant influence over, and possess the voting power to control our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions and transactions requiring stockholder approval. These may include, for example, the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our corporate documents and the approval of mergers and sales of our assets.\nAccording to an amendment to the Schedule 13D filed by Dr. Collins and Mary Collins with the SEC on May 19, 2015, Dr. Collins had made a determination to explore potential alternatives for making an offer to purchase some or all of the shares of the Company's common stock not beneficially owned by him or his spouse or otherwise undertake a \u201cgoing private\u201d transaction of the Company. In a subsequent amendment to the Schedule 13D filed by Dr. Collins and Mary Collins with the SEC on December 14, 2015, it was reported that Dr. Collins, Mary Collins and the other reporting persons named in the Schedule 13D amendment determined not to make an offer to purchase all of the shares of outstanding Company common stock that was not owned by him, Mary Collins and the other reporting persons as of the time of the filing of the Schedule 13D amendment. The December 2015 Schedule 13D amendment did state, however, that in the future, Dr. Collins and the other reporting persons may re-consider a possible transaction in which he or the other reporting persons in the Schedule 13D would offer to acquire the remaining shares of outstanding Company common stock not beneficially owned by them, but are no assurances that they will make any such offer. The public announcement of the exploration of these potential transactions in the future, as well as the potential that such transaction may occur, may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock.\nRisks Associated with Possible Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions\nIf we cannot successfully implement any future acquisitions or other strategic transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOn occasion, we evaluate business opportunities and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. We could decide to pursue one or more of these opportunities by acquisition or internal development. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve many risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention as a result of evaluating, negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures;\n\u2022\nour exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees of an acquired operation.\nIn addition, an acquisition or other strategic transactions could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute shareholder interests, for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ncharges to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022\nwrite-offs for the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022\ninterest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture; and\n\u2022\nany issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or other strategic transactions that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current common stockholders.\nWe have had no significant experience in executing and implementing acquisitions. Although we have implemented other strategic transactions, those ventures have not always been successful, and we may not succeed in the future. The risks associated with acquisitions and other strategic transactions could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nRisks Associated with Changing Economic Conditions\nGeneral domestic and international economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and common stock price. As a result of the current economic uncertainty and macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world, some of our customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases of courses from us until the economy and their businesses strengthen.\nThe United States government\u2019s inability to agree on a federal budget may adversely impacted our operations and financial results. We believe the implementation by the U.S. federal government of the automatic spending cuts commonly referred to as \u201cSequestration\u201d had a significant negative impact on our North American operations as our government customers faced uncertainty over whether the amount of funds allotted for training was actually available. This uncertainty led to lower enrollments and cancellation of existing enrollments from the government sector and to some degree from those of our commercial customers that rely heavily on government contracts. While the U.S. federal government has passed a budget agreement for fiscal year 2016, there is still not an allocation of that budget at an agency level. To the extent that the government agencies using our services are not allocated sufficient funds, then such agencies may not be able to continue using our services, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nUnited States government action or inaction with respect to the continuing budget deficit could adversely impact our operations and financial results. The inability of the United States Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal year, another sequestration, and or another shutdown of the United States Government could adversely impact demand for our services by limiting the funding available to many of our customers, particularly those in the government sector. Various entities of the United States government and United States government contractors, on a combined basis, account for more than fifteen percent of our business. Implementation of major legislative reductions to the federal budget could reduce, delay or cancel funding used by our government and government contractor customers to purchase our services, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.\nDomestic and/or International Economic Downturns. A significant part of our revenues comes from Fortune 1000-level companies, their international equivalents, and government organizations. During weak economic conditions, our sales grow more slowly or can even diminish. If the domestic and/or international economy were to continue to weaken, the demand for our services could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nIndustry-Specific Slowdowns. Our customers generally operate in the finance, computer, communications, electronics, systems integration, aerospace, government and military, manufacturing, and energy sectors. When one or more of these industries experiences a slowdown, it can have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nGlobalization Issues. Our operations are concentrated in Europe and North America, which have traditionally been the centers of IT development and implementation. In recent years, there has been increasing IT activity in other parts of the world, such as China and India. If this trend adversely affects IT jobs in regions in which we have our principal operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law could adversely impact the interests of our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, our Bylaws, as amended, and Delaware law could, together or separately, discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so might benefit our stockholders. These provisions may also affect the price investors would receive for their shares of our common stock. Some examples of these provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, as amended, are:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are senior to the common stock, without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations of the rights of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of stockholder actions by written consent.\nNatural Disasters, External Strikes, Acts of War or Terrorism and Other External Events\nSince our founding in 1974, various natural disasters, external labor disruptions, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external factors have from time to time impaired our ability to conduct our business, resulted in the loss of revenue or otherwise affected our operating results. When these or other external events occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nNatural Disasters. Natural disasters can affect our business. For example, severe weather has at times prevented our course participants from traveling to our courses. In these situations, we try to transfer the course participants to later courses, but we may still lose some revenue. Similarly, both weather and floods have also disrupted the printing and transportation of the catalogs we use in our direct mail campaigns. The resulting delays in our mailings may reduce or delay the revenue we realize from courses listed in those catalogs.\nExternal Strikes. We have had to react to postal, transportation, and other strikes in the countries where we operate. Postal strikes delay or reduce the delivery of our direct mail marketing materials, which may result in reduced enrollments in upcoming course events. Transportation strikes can make it difficult for our course participants or our instructors to reach course facilities. Although we try to employ strategies to mitigate the impact of external strikes, these alternative means are rarely completely effective and generally increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nActs of War or Terrorism. Threats or acts of war or terrorism can adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks in the United States and in other countries and continuing hostilities in the Middle East and elsewhere have created significant instability and uncertainty in the world. These and future events may have a material adverse effect on world financial markets, including financial markets in the United States. In addition, threats or acts of war or terrorism can cause course participants to be reluctant regarding or prevented from traveling to our course facilities, thereby resulting in lower attendance rates. Additionally, our direct mail marketing materials may be delayed or disrupted from reaching our customers; and suppliers and service providers may be unable to provide required services or materials. These impacts could happen after we have committed to all the costs of our course, so that we would be unable to quickly adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues caused by these events, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price.\nOther External Factors. Other factors outside our control can affect our operations, including those related to our suppliers and service providers. For example, disruptions of telephone networks can prevent customers from enrolling in our courses; disruptions in transportation services can prevent customers from reaching our facilities, and power outages can prevent us from delivering courses. Similarly, if commodities (for example, the paper used in the printing of our catalogs) that we or our customers need become scarce or more expensive, our operating results may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 82720, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "LTRE"}
