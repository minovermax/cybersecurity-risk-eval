Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our Class A common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIt is difficult to predict our future operating results.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including planning for and modeling future growth. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to industry or market developments, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. Specifically, the current outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic, has spread across the globe and is significantly impacting worldwide economic activity. COVID-19 could result in one or more of the following conditions that could affect us and our customers: increased risk in collectability of accounts receivable; reduced staff productivity due to working at home for extended periods; lost staff productivity due to illness and/or illness in the family; increased customer losses/churn; increased challenges in acquiring new customers; extreme currency exchange-rate fluctuations; and challenges with Internet infrastructure due to high loads. The duration and scope of the pandemic is highly uncertain. We continue to monitor the effect that the COVID-19 outbreak may have, and while it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19, and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected, will likely have an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have a history of cumulative losses and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred losses in each period since we incorporated in 2005. We incurred net losses attributable to common shareholders of $95.9 million, $53.9 million, and $53.7 million during the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of January 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $256.5 million. These losses and accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we made to develop our products and services, acquire new customers, and maintain and expand existing customers. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future due to anticipated increases in sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, operations costs, and general and administrative costs, and therefore we expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we will also incur increased losses due to upfront costs associated with acquiring new customers, particularly as a result of the nature of subscription revenue, which is generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period. You should not consider our recent revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. Our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our subscription solutions or professional services, reduced conversion from our free trial users or collaborators to paid users, increasing competition, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the foreseeable future, nor that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for collaborative work management platforms is fragmented, increasingly competitive, and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. Our competitors range in size, from diversified global companies with significant research and development and marketing resources, to smaller startups building on new technology platforms whose narrower offerings may allow them to be more efficient in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources.\nCertain of our features compete with current or potential products and services offered by Airtable, Asana, Atlassian, Monday.com, Planview, Workfront, Wrike, and others. We also face competition from Google and Microsoft, who offer a range of productivity solutions including spreadsheets and email that have traditionally been used for work management. While we currently collaborate with Microsoft and Google, they may develop and introduce products that directly or indirectly compete with our platform. As we look to sell products and services to potential customers with existing internal solutions, we must convince their stakeholders that our platform is superior to the solutions that their organization has previously adopted and deployed. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, and the growth of existing market participants, we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future.\nMany of our current and potential competitors, particularly large software companies, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, more established customer bases, and significantly greater financial, operating, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with distribution partners and customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our platform, including by selling at zero or negative margins or using product bundling. Further, our competitors may respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new collaborative work management products, add new features to their current product offerings, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, form strategic alliances with other companies, or are acquired by third parties with greater available resources. We may also face increasing competition if our competitors provide products and services for free. If our competitors\u2019 products or services are more widely adopted than ours, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market sooner than ours, if their pricing is more competitive, or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be harmed.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data or our data is otherwise obtained, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce or stop using our platform, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur products and services involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers\u2019 sensitive and proprietary information, including business strategies, financial and operational data, personal or identifying information, and other data. As a result, unauthorized use of or access to this data could result in the loss, compromise, corruption, or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 sensitive and proprietary information and lead to litigation, regulatory investigations and claims, indemnity obligations, loss of authorization under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, and other liabilities. While we have security measures in place designed to protect the integrity of customer information and prevent data loss, misappropriation, and other security breaches and incidents, our platform is subject to ongoing threats, and we anticipate being required to expend significant resources in an effort to protect against security breaches and incidents. We have been subject to phishing attacks in the past, and may be subject to cyber-attacks, phishing attacks, malicious software programs, and other attacks in the future. These attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations. In addition to these threats, the security, integrity, and availability of our and our customers\u2019 data could be compromised by employee negligence, error or malfeasance, and product defects.\nAdditionally, we engage service providers to store and otherwise process some of our and our customers\u2019 data, including sensitive and personal information. Our service providers may also be the targets of cyberattacks, malicious software programs, phishing attacks, and fraud. Our ability to monitor our service providers\u2019 data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, or misuse, disclosure, loss, or destruction of our and our customers\u2019 data.\nA compromise of our or our service providers\u2019 security measures due to any of the threats mentioned above could result in unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our customers\u2019 or our data, or other disruption to our or our customers\u2019 business operations, which could lead to litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, damage to our reputation and market position, and could cause us to incur significant liabilities, including fines, penalties, and other damages. Even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. Further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to investigate and address any actual or suspected data security incident or breach, or to prevent further or additional security incidents or breaches. In addition, we may find it necessary or desirable to incur costs to provide remediation and incentives to customers or other business partners following a security breach or other security incident in an effort to maintain business relationships.\nTechniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. We and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, not all of our customer and other agreements contain limitation of liability provisions and we cannot assure that any such limitation of liability provisions in our customer and user agreements or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate, or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter. We also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a security incident, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and maintain and expand sales to existing customers, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed.\nOur future growth depends in part upon increasing our customer base, and our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, and our ability to predict customer demands and to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization is reluctant to try a cloud-based collaborative work management platform or has already invested significantly in an existing solution. If we fail to predict customer demands or attract new customers and maintain and expand those customer relationships, our revenue and business may be harmed.\nOur future growth also depends upon expanding sales of our platform and services to, and renewing subscriptions with, existing customers and their organizations. In order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our existing customers increase their use of our platform through new use cases and new users, and purchase more subscriptions to our platform and our services and premium solutions. If our existing customers do not expand their use of our platform through their organization and purchase additional subscriptions, services, or premium solutions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all, or may decline.\nAdditionally, increasing upsell to enterprise customers requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts targeted at senior management. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in increased sales to existing customers or upsells, and additional revenue. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business will suffer. Moreover, many of our subscriptions are sold for a one-year term. While many of our subscriptions provide for automatic renewal, our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription after the expiration of the term and we cannot assure you that our customers will renew subscriptions with a similar contract period or the same or greater number of users or premium solutions. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our platform or services, our pricing or pricing structure, the pricing or capabilities of the products and services offered by our competitors, the effects of economic conditions, or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our customers do not renew their agreements with us, or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly operating results, including the levels of our revenue, billings, gross margin, profitability, cash flow, and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuations in quarterly operating results may reduce the value of our Class A common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe impact of, including but not limited to the market volatility and economic disruption caused by, COVID-19 or any other worldwide pandemic;\n\u2022\ncustomers impacted by macroeconomic downturns and seeking bankruptcy protection or other similar relief;\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 failure to pay amounts due to us, customers\u2019 extending the time to pay amounts owed to us, our inability to collect amounts due, and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers, including internationally;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations which will cause our interest income to decrease during low interest rate environments;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nthe mix of customers obtained through self-service on our website and sales-assisted channels;\n\u2022\ncustomer renewal rates and the extent to which customers purchase services and subscribe for additional users and products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and growth of our business, in particular through our hiring of new employees and international expansion;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train, and maintain our sales force;\n\u2022\nthe length and timing of sales cycles with a significant portion of our larger transactions occurring in the last few days and weeks of each quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognition of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or offerings, or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation or new entrants among competitors, customers, or strategic partners;\n\u2022\ncustomers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe timing and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nnetwork or service outages, Internet disruptions, security breaches or perceived security breaches impacting us, and the costs associated with responding to and addressing such outages or breaches;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations that affect our business, and any lawsuits or other proceedings involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates or addition of currencies in which our sales are denominated; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry, and market conditions.\nWe depend on our co-location data centers, public cloud service providers, and computing infrastructure operated by third parties, and any service outages, delays, or disruptions in these operations could harm our business and operating results.\nWe host our platform and serve our customers from leased co-location data centers located in Chicago, Illinois, and Ashburn, Virginia and through public cloud service providers. We are in the process of consolidating the hosting of our platform through public cloud service providers exclusively. While we control and have access to our servers and the components of our network that are located in our leased co-location data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. Public cloud service providers run their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions, delays, and outages. Our co-location data centers and public cloud service providers (collectively, our \u201cHosting Providers\u201d) may experience events such as natural disasters, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, or similar events. The systems, infrastructure, and services of our Hosting Providers may also be subject to human or software errors, viruses, security attacks (internal and external), fraud, spikes in customer usage, denial of service issues, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, malware, phishing attacks, acts of terrorism, and other misconduct. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect that in the future we may experience, periodic interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability with our Hosting Providers due to a variety of factors, including Internet connectivity failures, infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time.\nWe may also be affected by other problems relating to our Hosting Providers, such as financial difficulties and bankruptcy. The occurrence of any such events or other unanticipated problems with our Hosting Providers could result in lengthy interruptions, delays, and outages in our service and noncompliance with our contractual obligations or business requirements.\nFurther, our Hosting Providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew agreements with these Hosting Providers on commercially reasonable terms, if our agreements with these Hosting Providers are prematurely terminated for any reason, if one of our Hosting Providers is acquired or ceases business, or if our migration to the public cloud results in interruptions, delays, outages, or needs to be halted or reversed, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center or public cloud facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruptions in connection with doing so.\nAdditionally, there are limited options for public cloud service providers capable of effectively supporting our infrastructure. Consolidation through a single, or select few, service provider(s) may result in a dependency on the selected provider(s). Consolidation may also negatively impact customer acquisition or expansion as customers or potential customers may object to certain providers for a variety of reasons, including that such providers do not meet their hosting requirements or that the providers operate in a competitive space; any such objections could harm our business and operating results.\nAny issues with our Hosting Providers may result in errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our platform, which could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our platform\u2019s operation might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or refunds to customers, subject us to potential liability, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, harm our renewal rates, and affect our reputation. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from a single offering.\nAlthough we offer additional solutions, we currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from our cloud-based collaborative work management platform. As such, the continued growth in market demand for our platform is critical to our continued success. Demand for our platform is affected by a number of factors, including continued market acceptance, the timing of development and release of competing products and services, price or product changes by us or by our competitors, technological changes, growth or contraction in the markets we serve, and general economic conditions and trends. In addition, some current and potential customers, particularly large organizations, may develop or acquire their own internal collaborative work management tools or continue to rely on traditional tools that would reduce or eliminate the demand for our platform. If demand for our platform declines for any of these or other reasons, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have recently experienced rapid growth and expect our growth to continue. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and operational controls, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our personnel headcount and operations. During the period from January 31, 2016 to January 31, 2020 we grew from 274 employees to 1,588 employees. In addition, we have recently hired new members of management, and we have engaged temporary employees and contractors to supplement our employee base. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and personnel headcount in the near term. This growth has made our operations more complex and has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth and complexity effectively. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls, processes, and documentation, and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth or complexity could result in difficulties growing and maintaining our customer base; cost increases; inefficient and ineffective responses to customer needs; delays in developing and deploying new features, integrations, or services; violations of law; breaches of contract; or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could harm our business and operating results.\nAs a substantial portion of our sales efforts are targeted at enterprise and government customers, our sales cycle may become longer and more expensive, we may encounter implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for more complicated transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur ability to increase revenue and achieve and maintain profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our platform by large businesses, government agencies, and other organizations. In addition, to achieve acceptance of our platform by such customers, we will need to engage with and gain the acceptance of knowledge workers, who are often the initial adopters of our platform, and senior management. As a result, sales efforts targeted at enterprise and government customers involve greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition, increased operational burden, and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In the large enterprise and government agency markets, the customer\u2019s decision to use our platform and services can sometimes be an organization-wide decision, in which case, we will likely be required to provide greater levels of customer education to familiarize potential customers with the use and benefits of our platform and services, as well as training and support. In addition, larger enterprises and government agencies may demand more features, configuration options, and integration and support services. They may also expect operational changes to satisfy their supplier requirements. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support, research and development, engineering, customer support, professional services resources, and other internal resources and processes to these customers, resulting in increased costs, lengthened sales cycles, and diversion of sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of customers. Moreover, these larger transactions may require us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.\nIf our platform fails to perform properly, or if we are unable to scale our platform to meet the needs of our customers, our reputation could be harmed, our market share could decline, and we could be subject to liability claims.\nOur platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. We provide regular updates to our platform, which may contain undetected defects when first introduced or released. Any defects in functionality or interruptions in the availability of our platform, or user error, could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of, or delayed, market acceptance and sales;\n\u2022\nbreach of contract or warranty claims;\n\u2022\nissuance of credits or other compensation for downtime;\n\u2022\ntermination of subscription agreements, loss of customers, and issuance of refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription fees for our platform;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and customer service resources; and\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors might be substantial and could harm our operating results.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, hardware failures, errors in our systems, user errors, or Internet outages could result in data loss or corruption that our customers may regard as significant. Furthermore, the availability and performance of our platform and services could be diminished or otherwise impacted by a number of factors, which may damage the perception of the reliability of our applications and reduce our revenue. These factors include but are not limited to customers\u2019 inability to access the Internet; the failure of our network or software systems, including backup systems; simultaneous development efforts; computing vulnerabilities; security breaches; capacity issues or service failures experienced by our service providers; or variability in user traffic for our platform. We monitor vulnerabilities that may impact our business and the availability of our platform. Any such impact, and the costs incurred in addressing or correcting these vulnerabilities, may harm our operating results.\nWe may be required to issue credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused fees, or otherwise be liable to our customers for damages they may incur resulting from certain of these events. In addition to potential liability, if we experience interruptions in the availability of our platform, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention.\nFurthermore, we will need to ensure that our platform can scale to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly as we continue to focus on larger enterprise customers. We regularly monitor and update our platform to fix errors, add functionality, and improve scaling. Our customers have occasionally experienced outages and latency issues, sometimes during peak usage periods, including outages in July 2019. If we are not able to provide our platform at the scale required by our customers and correct any platform functionality defects and capacity limitations, potential customers may not adopt our platform and existing customers may not renew their agreements with us.\nIf we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, or experience service outages, interruptions, or delays in the deployment of our platform, we may be subject to liabilities and operating results may be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of users and data that our operations infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of\nour customers and users, as well as our own needs, and to ensure that our platform is accessible within an acceptable load time. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. We need to properly manage our technological operations infrastructure in order to support version control, changes in hardware and software parameters, and the evolution of our platform. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead-time. If we do not accurately predict or manage our infrastructure requirements, if our existing providers are unable to keep up with our needs for capacity, if they are unwilling or unable to allocate sufficient capacity to us, or if we are unable to contract with additional providers on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may experience service interruptions, delays, or outages that may subject us to financial penalties, cause us to issue credits or other compensation to customers, or result in other liabilities and customer losses. If our operations infrastructure fails to scale, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could damage our reputation and our business. We may also be required to move or transfer our and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery and performance of our platform.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological changes, our platform may become less competitive and our business may suffer.\nOur industry is marked by rapid technological developments and innovations, and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features and integrations for our existing platform, develop new products that achieve market acceptance, or innovate quickly enough to keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, because our platform is designed to operate on a variety of systems, we will need to continuously modify, enhance, and improve our platform to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware; mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android; and other software, communication, browser, and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications, enhancements, and improvements or in bringing them to market quickly or cost-effectively in response to market demands. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our products to keep pace with technological changes or operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies, or to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner, could reduce the demand for our platform, result in customer dissatisfaction, and reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business.\nChanges in privacy laws, regulations, and standards may reduce the effectiveness of our platform and harm our business.\nOur customers can use our products and services to collect, use, and otherwise process personal information. National and state governments and data regulators in the countries in which we, our customers, and our service providers operate have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws, regulations, and standards regarding the collection, use, and other processing of personal information. Privacy laws and regulations can vary significantly by jurisdiction and are particularly stringent in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions such as Brazil, Canada, and China. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), may limit the use and adoption of our products and services; reduce overall demand for our products and services; lead to regulatory investigations, litigation, and significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for actual or alleged noncompliance; slow the pace at which we close sales transactions; restrict our ability to make product or operational improvements; limit our ability to collect or utilize certain data; or create operational burden, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, if we or our service providers fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, it may limit our ability to offer our products and services in certain jurisdictions, or damage our reputation and brand.\nAny systems failure, security breach, or other incident that results in the release of, or unauthorized access to, personal information, or any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our contractual obligations or any privacy laws or regulations, could result in proceedings against us by data regulators or others. Such proceedings\ncould result in the imposition of sanctions, fines, penalties, liabilities, or governmental orders requiring that we change our data handling practices, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, privacy laws, regulations, and standards may be interpreted in new and differing manners in the future, may be modified, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Future laws, regulations, and standards and changes in the interpretation thereof could result in any or all of the following for us, our customers, and our service providers: increased regulation, increased costs of compliance, penalties for non-compliance, and limitations on data processing. For example, data transfer mechanisms on which we rely, such as the Privacy Shield programs or the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, have been subject to challenges and it is unclear whether they will continue to serve as valid means for the transfer of personal data to the United States. Additionally, Brexit could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes in the United Kingdom. It remains unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will change as Brexit is effectuated and whether the United Kingdom will be deemed an adequate jurisdiction by the European Union. Further, the State of California recently adopted the CCPA, which provides new data privacy rights for consumers, expands the definition of \u201cpersonal information,\u201d and provides a private right of action to be brought against businesses that fail to comply. Recently, several amendments to the CCPA were signed into law in California and the California Attorney General has issued draft regulations; we continue to monitor these changes and their effects. The continued evolution of the CCPA may increase uncertainty, risk, and exposure.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by privacy laws, regulations, and standards that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may reduce our or our customers\u2019 ability and willingness to collect, use, and otherwise process certain types of information, which could limit the use, effectiveness, and adoption of our products and services and reduce overall demand. Further, if we or our customers are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we or our customers operate, it could decrease demand for our products and services, require us to modify or restrict our business operations, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. Any changes we consider necessary or appropriate for compliance with privacy laws, regulations, standards, or contractual obligations may not be able to be made in a commercially reasonable manner, in a timely fashion, or at all. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit the adoption, effectiveness or use of our products and services, and may damage our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may establish or propose various new or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Further, our customers may expect us to comply with more stringent privacy and data security requirements or standards. If we are unable to meet any of these standards or related contractual obligations, we could face litigation, harm to our reputation and market position, a loss of customers, reduced demand for our offerings, and harm to our business.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued service of our senior management team, which provides leadership and contributions in the areas of product development, operations, security, marketing, sales, customer support, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business.\nWe do not have employment agreements with any member of our senior management team, and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any employee. The loss of one or more members of our senior management team, especially our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark P. Mader, or other key employees may be disruptive to our business.\nOur growth depends on our ability to expand our sales force.\nIn order to increase our revenue and achieve profitability, we must increase the size of our sales force, both in the United States and internationally, to generate additional revenue from new and existing customers. We intend to further increase our number of sales personnel but we may not be successful in doing so.\nWe believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training,\nand retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take considerable time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business, which may cause us to have to explore new markets to find talent. In addition, as we continue to grow, a large percentage of our sales personnel may be new to our company and our platform, which may adversely affect our sales if we cannot train them quickly or effectively. Attrition rates may increase and we may face integration challenges as we continue to seek to expand our sales force. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to attract, integrate, and retain highly qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to expand our organization with highly skilled personnel. Identifying, recruiting, training, and integrating qualified individuals will require significant time, expense, and attention. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining our best employees. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense. We compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing, and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled product development, marketing, sales, and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need, particularly in the greater Seattle area where our headquarters are located. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, certain immigration laws restrict or limit our ability to recruit internationally. Any changes to immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees.\nAdditionally, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees, alone or with our inducement, have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived or actual value of our equity awards declines, it may reduce our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success has been our corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. As we continue to grow, including expanding our presence domestically and internationally, and maintaining the controls associated with being a public company, we will need to preserve and maintain our corporate culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nFailure to establish and maintain relationships with partners that can provide complementary technology offerings and software integrations could limit our ability to grow our business.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding the use of our platform through complementary technology offerings and software integrations, such as third-party APIs. While we have established relationships with providers of complementary technology offerings and software integrations, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining relationships with these providers or establishing relationships with new providers. Third-party providers of complementary technology offerings and software integrations may decline to enter into, or may later terminate, relationships with us; change their features or platforms; restrict our access to their applications and platforms; or alter the terms governing use of and access to their applications and APIs in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party technology offerings and software integrations with our platform, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business.\nFurther, if we fail to integrate our platform with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use, or to adapt to the data transfer requirements of such third-party applications and platforms, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our offerings and, as a result, could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we may benefit from these partners\u2019 brand recognition, reputations, referrals, and customer bases. Any losses or shifts in the referrals from, or the market positions of, these partners generally, in relation to one another or to new competitors or technologies, could lead to losses in our relationships or customers, or a need to identify or transition to alternative channels for marketing our platform.\nWe rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in or the loss of access to software or services from third parties could negatively impact our business operations.\nWe use and rely on technologies and software from third parties to operate critical functions of our business, including cloud infrastructure services, customer relationship management services, and business management services. Our business would be disrupted if any of the third-party software or services we utilize were unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, or if they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries, and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. In the event of disruption, we may be required to seek replacement software or services from other parties, or to develop these components ourselves, which could result in increased costs, delays in the release of new product offerings, and reduced efficiencies in the operations of our impacted departments, until suitable technology can be identified and integrated. These disruptions, if they occur, could result in customer dissatisfaction, and harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to develop, maintain, and enhance our brand, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nWe believe that developing, maintaining, and enhancing our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform, attracting new customers, retaining existing customers, persuading existing customers to adopt additional solutions and services and expand their number of users, and hiring and retaining employees. We believe that the importance of our brand will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our marketing efforts; our ability to provide a high-quality, reliable, and cost-effective platform; the perceived value of our platform; and our ability to provide a quality customer success experience.\nBrand promotion activities require us to make substantial expenditures. We have begun to make more significant investments in the promotion of our brand, however, our ability to successfully promote our brand is uncertain. We anticipate that our expenditures on brand promotion will continue to increase in the near term as our market expands. The promotion of our brand, however, may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building and maintaining our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or fail to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform, which could harm our business and operating results.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions and support services over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in new sales or renewals may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be difficult to discern.\nWe recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically one year. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely only have a minor effect on our revenue for that quarter, and such a decline will reduce our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our pricing policies or customer retention rates, may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. We may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenue. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase\nour revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from new customers is recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe may not receive significant revenue from our current development efforts for several years, if at all.\nDeveloping our platform is expensive and the investment in such technological development often involves a long return on investment cycle. We incurred research and development expenses of $95.5 million, $58.8 million, and $37.6 million during the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in development and related opportunities, such as maintaining authorization under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate significant resources to our development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments for several years, if at all.\nOur limited history with subscription and pricing models makes it difficult to accurately predict optimal pricing necessary to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\nWe have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our platform and services and, as a result, we have in the past, and expect in the future, that we will need to change our published and unpublished pricing models from time to time. As the market for our platform and services matures, or as competitors introduce new products or platforms that compete with ours, and as we expand into international markets, we may be unable to attract and retain customers at the same price or based on the same pricing models as we have historically, if at all, and some of our competitors may offer their products at a lower price. Pricing decisions may also affect the mix of adoption among our subscription plans and reduce our overall revenue. Moreover, larger enterprises may demand substantial price concessions. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices, which could harm our operating results.\nContractual disputes with, or commitments to, our customers may be costly, time-consuming, may result in terminations, and could harm our reputation.\nThe sale of our products and services is contract intensive and we are a party to contracts with our customers globally. Our contracts contain a wide variety of commitments, including security and privacy obligations, indemnification obligations, and regulatory requirements. Contract terms are not always standardized across our customers and may be subject to differing interpretations, which could result in disputes with our customers. If our customers notify us of an alleged contract breach or otherwise dispute any provision under our contracts, the resolution of such disputes in a manner adverse to us could negatively affect our operating results.\nCertain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments, including uptime requirements, we may be contractually obligated to provide these affected customers with service credits or refunds which could significantly affect our revenue in the period in which the uptime failure occurs or the period in which the credits are due. We could also face subscription terminations, which could significantly affect both our current and future revenue. Our platform experienced outages in July 2019 which resulted in the issuance of credits or other compensation to certain customers. Any additional service level failures could damage our reputation, which would also affect our future revenue and operating results.\nWe may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings for a variety of claims, which could adversely affect our results of operations, harm our reputation, or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved as a party or an indemnitor in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. These may include alleged claims, lawsuits, and proceedings involving labor and employment, wage and hour, commercial, securities law violations or other investor claims, and other matters. For example, an indemnification claim is currently being made against the Company in a lawsuit against a former director and shareholder to which we are not a party. Additionally, we sometimes engage contractors and other temporary workers to fill vacancies or otherwise provide services, and any incorrect classification of such staff could\nresult in liability or alleged claims, lawsuits, proceedings, or penalties. We expect that the number and significance of these potential disputes may increase as our business expands and our company grows larger.\nCustomers may make claims for damages arising from the use of our platform. There can be no assurance that contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued by customers or called upon to fulfill indemnification obligations. Although we carry general liability and director and officer liability insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include provisions under which we agree to provide certain defense and indemnity obligations for losses suffered or incurred as a result of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or other liabilities relating to or arising from our contractual obligations. Indemnity payments and defense costs may be substantial and could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Any dispute involving a customer and relating to such indemnity obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing or potential customers, and may harm our business and operating results.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers, or a failure to renew our subscription agreements with one or more of our key customers, could negatively affect our ability to market our platform.\nWe rely on our reputation and recommendations from key customers in order to promote subscriptions to our platform. The loss of, or failure to renew by, any of our key customers could have a significant effect on our revenue, reputation, and our ability to obtain new customers. In addition, acquisitions of our customers could lead to cancellation of such customers\u2019 contracts, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential customers.\nOur platform uses third-party software and services that may be difficult to replace or may cause errors or failures of our platform that could lead to a loss of customers or harm to our reputation and our operating results.\nWe license third-party software and depend on services from various third parties to operate our platform. In the future, this software or these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of the software or services could result in decreased functionality of our platform until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available from another provider, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business. In addition, any errors or defects in or failures of the third-party software or services could result in errors or defects in our platform or cause our platform to fail, which could harm our business and be costly to correct. Such errors, defects, or failures could also harm our reputation and result in liability to third parties, including customers. Many of these providers attempt to limit their liability for errors, defects, and failures, which could limit our ability to recover from them and increase our operating costs.\nWe will need to maintain our relationships with third-party software and service providers and obtain software and services from such providers that do not contain errors or defects. Any failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to deliver our platform to our customers and could harm our operating results.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software in our platform and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. There are uncertainties regarding the proper interpretation of and compliance with open source licenses, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our\nability to use such open source software, and consequently to provide or distribute our platform. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works, or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. These claims could also result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, devote additional research and development resources to change our platform, or incur additional costs and expenses, any of which could result in reputational harm and would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for the open source software we utilize change, we may be forced to re-engineer our platform or incur additional costs to comply with the changed license terms or to replace the affected open source software. Further, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Although we have implemented policies to regulate the use and incorporation of open source software into our platform, we cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in our platform in a manner that is inconsistent with such policies.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nOur customers rely on our customer support organization to resolve issues with their use of our platform and to respond to their inquiries relating to our platform. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services could increase costs and harm our operating results. Customers who elect not to purchase support may be unable to sufficiently address their support issues through self-service, and their support requests may not be prioritized once received by us; this may result in a poor customer experience. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the ease of use of our platform, our business reputation, and positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain a high-quality customer success and support organization, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support, could harm our reputation, our ability to sell to existing and prospective customers, and our business.\nOur long-term growth depends in part on being able to expand internationally on a profitable basis.\nHistorically, we have generated a majority of our revenue from customers in the United States. We are expanding internationally and plan to continue to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy. There are certain risks inherent in conducting international business, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or adding additional currencies in which our sales are denominated;\n\u2022\nnew, or changes in existing, regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ntariffs, export and import restrictions, restrictions on foreign investments, sanctions, and other trade barriers or protection measures;\n\u2022\ncosts of localizing our platform and services;\n\u2022\nlack of or delayed acceptance of localized versions of our platform and services;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in and costs of staffing, managing, and operating our international operations;\n\u2022\ntax issues, including restrictions on repatriating earnings, and with respect to our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements;\n\u2022\nweaker intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of, and burden and expense involved with, compliance with privacy, data protection, data residency, and information security laws and regulations, such as the GDPR;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness or currency-related crises;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell products and services in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nour ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures;\n\u2022\nlack of brand recognition;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, uncertainty, or change, such as that caused by Brexit;\n\u2022\nhealth or similar issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as the current outbreak of COVID-19;\n\u2022\nsecurity risks in the countries where we are doing business; and\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationship with resellers to distribute our platform internationally.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our business. For example, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In addition, in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or applicable U.S. laws and regulations. As we grow, we continue to implement compliance procedures designed to prevent violations of these laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, resellers, and agents will comply with the formal policies we will implement, or applicable laws and regulations. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, resellers, or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the import or export of our products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurther, our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully, or in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nOur forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Our forecasts, including the size and expected growth in the addressable market for collaborative work management platforms, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our platform and services and could harm our business.\nU.S. federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations relating to Internet usage. The adoption of any laws or regulations that could reduce the growth, popularity, or use of the Internet, including laws or practices regarding Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for, or the usage of, our platform and services, increase our cost of doing business, and harm our operating results. Changes in these laws or regulations could also require us to modify our platform in order to comply with these laws or regulations. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees, or other charges for accessing the Internet or for commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could\nlimit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications, or reduce demand for Internet-based services and platforms such as ours.\nWe use email as part of our platform for communication and workflow management. Internet service providers continually develop new technologies to filter messages deemed to be unwanted before they reach users\u2019 inboxes, which may interfere with the deliverability of email messages from our platform. Government regulations, laws regarding electronic communications, and evolving practices regarding the use of email could restrict our use of email. Any deliverability issues or restrictions on our use of email would reduce functionality of our platform, impact user adoption, and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of the Internet and, in particular, cloud-based solutions, could be adversely affected by delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the Internet has been adversely affected by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms,\u201d and similar malicious programs; businesses have experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to Internet infrastructure. These issues could diminish the overall attractiveness of, and demand for, our platform.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property or a violation of our intellectual property rights by third parties may damage our brand and our reputation. In addition to certain patents and patent applications, we primarily rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret protections, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of our products and services. We also believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand, and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Any efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Remedies following any such infringement or misappropriation, including injunctive relief, may be insufficient to enjoin the infringement or misappropriation or otherwise address the damages sustained. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously damage our brand and our business.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our future success depends on our technology, platform, and services not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities, including non-practicing entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. Additionally, we rely on the feedback provided by our customers and users to inform decisions on potential changes to our products and services, and we negotiate agreements with our customers that may include license rights to intellectual property developed while performing professional services. Such feedback and license rights may provide a customer or user a basis for competing against us or contesting ownership of current or future intellectual property.\nWe cannot assure you that actions by other third parties alleging infringement by us of third- party intellectual property rights will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. In the future, others may claim that our technology, platform, or services infringe or violate their intellectual property rights, even if we are unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our platform or services or using certain technologies, require that we implement expensive workarounds, or require that we comply with other unfavorable conditions.\nWe may also be obligated, without contractual limitation of liability provisions to limit our exposure, to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation, and to obtain licenses, modify our platform or services, or refund fees, which could be costly. In addition, we may incur substantial costs or take material action to resolve claims or litigation, whether or not successfully asserted against us, which could include payment of significant settlement, royalty, or license fees; modification of our products and services; or issuance of refunds to customers. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. During the course of any litigation, we may make announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline if securities analysts and investors view those announcements negatively.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial and management systems, may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. We are subject to reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the rules and regulations of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will likely strain our financial and management systems, internal controls, and employees.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Moreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control, over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over, financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we cannot remediate such material weaknesses, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Effective internal control is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to prevent fraud.\nIn addition, as of January 31, 2020 we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we are no longer permitted to rely on exemptions from certain requirements made available to emerging growth companies. For example, we are now required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. To assist us in complying with these requirements we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.\nPublic company director and officer liability insurance is expensive, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or similar coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which, if not remediated appropriately or timely, could result in adverse effects on the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting, inability to comply with securities law and exchange listing requirements, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact our stock price.\nInternal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report, management identified material weaknesses evidencing an ineffective control environment relating to (i) certain revenue and billing processes; (ii) ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access, program change-management, and computer operations controls over certain information technology systems that support the Company\u2019s financial reporting processes; and (iii) insufficient resources with an appropriate level of controls knowledge and expertise commensurate with the Company\u2019s financial reporting requirements. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 31, 2020. We are implementing remedial measures and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. These measures will result in additional technology and other expenses. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent potential future material weaknesses. If we are unable to successfully remediate the existing or any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, and as a result we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports or the New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and our share price to decline.\nWe intend to evaluate acquisitions or investments in third-party technologies and businesses, but we may not realize the anticipated benefits from, and may have to pay substantial costs related to, any acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or investments that we undertake.\nAs part of our business strategy, we continually evaluate acquisitions of, or investments in, a wide array of potential strategic opportunities, including third-party technologies and businesses. We may be unable to identify suitable transaction candidates in the future or to make these transactions on a commercially reasonable basis, or at all. The evaluation of potential acquisitions and investments requires diversion of time and resources from normal business operations and may cost us to incur fees owed to outside advisors. Any transactions that we enter into could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Such transactions may not result in the intended benefits to our business, and we may not successfully evaluate or utilize any acquired technology, offerings, or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial effect of a transaction. Although we conduct a reasonably extensive due diligence of any transaction target entity, such due diligence may not reveal every concern that may exist with respect to the target entity, the proposed transaction, and any subsequent integration. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, technology, or personnel into our own company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\ndiverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our respective ongoing business operations;\n\u2022\ncustomer and industry acceptance of the acquired company\u2019s offerings;\n\u2022\nimplementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nintegrating acquired technologies in our own platform and technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to ensure that we maintain quality and security standards for the acquired technology consistent with our brand;\n\u2022\nretaining and integrating acquired employees;\n\u2022\nfailing to maintain important business relationships and contracts;\n\u2022\nfailing to realize any anticipated synergies;\n\u2022\nusing cash or equity that we may need in the future to operate our business or incurring debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to pay;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;\n\u2022\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nother unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.\nOur limited experience acquiring companies increases these risks. Our failure to address these risks or other problems we encounter with our acquisitions and investments could cause us to not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, including our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) and subsequent registered offering, finance lease arrangements, subscription fees from our customers, and through proceeds from option exercises and the sale of our capital stock pursuant to our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, declines in subscriptions for our platform, or unforeseen circumstances. A deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. We may not be able to timely secure debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Additionally, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service any debt financing obtained by us, which may force us to reduce or delay capital expenditures or sell assets or operations. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities, or other securities convertible into equity, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nOur reported financial results may be harmed by changes in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, in February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases: Topic 842 (\u201cTopic 842\u201d), for which we recorded material right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet upon adoption. We adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition method. Other companies in our industry may apply these accounting principles differently than we do, adversely affecting the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe could be subject to additional sales tax or other tax liabilities.\nState, local, and foreign taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added, and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of sales taxes to our platform in various jurisdictions is unclear. It is possible that\nwe could face tax audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as taxing authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. Additionally, we do not collect such transaction taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our understanding that such taxes are not applicable or an exemption from such taxes applies. If we become subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions and a successful assertion is made that we should be collecting sales, use, value added, or other taxes where we have not historically done so, it could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales; discourage customers from purchasing our products; or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurther, an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations on remote sellers to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. If new laws are adopted in a jurisdiction where we do not collect such taxes, we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were to successfully challenge our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of January 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), of approximately $205.6 million. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. As a result, our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes.\nFuture changes in our stock ownership, the causes of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state laws. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing tax laws or regulations could be applied to us or our customers in a manner that could increase the costs of our platform and services and harm our business.\nIncome, sales, use, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted or amended at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and could be applied solely or disproportionately to products and services provided over the Internet. These enactments or amendments could reduce our sales activity by increasing gross sales prices, inclusive of tax, and ultimately harm our operating results and cash flows.\nAdditionally, any changes to or the reform of current U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Currently, we have not accumulated significant foreign earnings; however, this could change on a go-forward basis as our international operations continue to develop. In addition, due to the expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe application of U.S. federal, state, local, and international tax laws to services provided electronically is unclear and continuously evolving. Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted or applied adversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect, which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties, as well as interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes due from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely affecting our operating results and harming our business.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWhile we have historically transacted in U.S. dollars with the majority of our customers and vendors, we have transacted in some foreign currencies and may transact in more foreign currencies in the future. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can affect our revenue and operating results due to transactional and translational re-measurement that is reflected in our earnings. As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and operating results. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our operating results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our Class A common stock could be lowered. Our foreign currency exchange policy approves use of certain hedging instruments, including spot transactions, forward contracts, and purchased options with maturity of up to one year. The use, if any, of such hedging instruments may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nFailure to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations or anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations, the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from promising, authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations.\nIn addition, we use various third parties to sell access to our platform and services and conduct our business abroad and to the federal government. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, and our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We have implemented an anti-corruption compliance program and adopted an anti-corruption policy, but we cannot assure you that all our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAny violation of Federal Acquisition Regulations, the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nGovernmental export or import controls could limit our ability to compete in foreign markets and subject us to liability if we violate them.\nOur platform and services may be subject to U.S. export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain features. U.S. export controls may require submission of a product classification and annual or semi-annual reports. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export authorization for our platform and services, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our platform and services may create delays in the introduction of our feature releases in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from using our platform and services or, in some cases, prevent the export of our platform and services to some countries altogether.\nFurthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons identified by U.S. sanction programs. If we fail to comply with export control regulations and such economic sanctions, we may be fined or other penalties could be imposed, including a denial of certain export privileges. In 2018, we determined that a small number of persons may have accessed our platform from one or more embargoed countries. We made an initial voluntary self-disclosure to the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) to report these potential violations and OFAC issued a Cautionary Letter as a final enforcement response. While our controls are designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully effective.\nMoreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation, or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform or services by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our services or access to our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or services, or limitation on our ability to export or sell our services or access to our platform, would likely adversely affect our business.\nOur sales are generally more heavily weighted toward the end of each fiscal quarter, which could have an impact on the timing of our billings, revenue, and collections, and on the reporting of such metrics for any given quarter and subsequent quarters.\nOur sales cycles are generally more heavily weighted toward the end of each fiscal quarter, with an increased volume of sales in the last few weeks and days of the quarter, and can otherwise be dependent on customer purchasing patterns and the timing of particularly large transactions. Any of the foregoing may have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections, may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows, may make it challenging for an investor to predict our performance on a quarterly or annual basis, and may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts.\nFurther, the concentration of contract negotiations in the last few weeks and days of the quarter may require us to expend more in the form of compensation for additional sales operations, legal, and finance employees and contractors. Compression of sales activity to the end of the quarter also greatly increases the likelihood that sales cycles will extend beyond the quarter in which they are forecasted to close for some sizable transactions, which may harm forecasting accuracy and adversely impact new customer acquisition metrics for the quarter in which they are forecasted to close.\nPolitical developments and adverse societal, economic, and market conditions and reductions in productivity spending may harm our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for cloud-based collaborative work management platforms and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. The United States has experienced cyclical downturns from time to time that have resulted in a significant weakening of the economy, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, and other difficulties that may affect one or more of the industries to which we sell subscriptions and professional services.\nFurther, political developments impacting government spending and international trade, including government shutdowns in the United States, the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, and trade disputes and tariffs, in particular with China, may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions. Brexit has created economic and political uncertainty, including volatility in global financial markets and the value of foreign currencies. The impact of Brexit may not be fully realized for several years or more. Uncertainty in the effects of Brexit may cause some of our customers or potential customers to curtail spending and may ultimately result in new regulatory, operational, and cost challenges to our United Kingdom and global operations. These adverse conditions could result in reductions in sales of our platform, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition. Any of these events would likely have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial position.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant worldwide operational and economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption, and the extent to\nwhich COVID-19 will adversely impact our business is highly uncertain, rapidly changing, and cannot be accurately predicted. A continued slowdown or downturn in the economy has begun to have, and we expect will continue to have, a negative impact on many of our customers.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted areas where we operate and areas of customer and user concentration. The impact of COVID-19 has limited, for an indefinite period of time, the business activities of our employees, partners, and customers, including due to shutdowns that have been and may continue to be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. COVID-19 has required our employees to utilize alternative working arrangements and has restricted our employees\u2019 ability to travel. The effects of these indefinite travel restrictions and alternative working arrangements are unknown, may negatively impact the productivity of our employee base, and may have a disproportionately negative impact on our sales and operations functions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. COVID-19 has also resulted in certain government closures and supply chain disruptions, which impact specific areas of our business, including by limiting our ability to complete background checks and screens necessary to hire and onboard employees and to provide necessary equipment to new and existing employees.\nUncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general economic uncertainty and associated macroeconomic conditions, make it extremely difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities which could cause customers to delay or reduce their information technology spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our platform and services, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that cloud-based collaborative work management and productivity spending levels will increase following any recovery.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruptions to our operations. Our corporate headquarters are located in the greater Seattle area, an earthquake-prone region and an area that has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, and sales activities. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may be inadequate and we may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our platform and services, breaches of data security, loss of critical data, and inability to continue our operations, all of which could harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our IPO at a price of $15.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $18.06 to $55.79 through March 20, 2020. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity related to the real or perceived quality of our platform, as well as the failure to timely launch new features, integrations, or services that gain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue or other operating metrics;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving our company or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived failures or breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with responding to and addressing any such actual or perceived failures or breaches;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nindemnity demands or lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, public health concerns or epidemics (such as the current COVID-19 pandemic), or responses to these events;\n\u2022\nsales or distributions of our Class A common stock held by our large institutional shareholders; and\n\u2022\nsales of additional shares of our Class A common stock by us or our shareholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In particular, the stock markets have been extremely volatile in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business.\nSales of a substantial amount of our Class A common stock in the public markets, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant shareholders, or the perception that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nShares held by our employees, executive officers, directors, and the majority of our security holders are currently tradeable in the public market, subject in certain cases to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), various vesting agreements, as well as our insider trading policy. Sales of a substantial number of such shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our market price to fall or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nIn addition, as of January 31, 2020, we had options outstanding that, if fully exercised or settled, would result in the issuance of 9,076,671 shares of Class A common stock, and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) outstanding that, if fully settled, would result in the issuance of 3,138,330 shares of Class A common stock. We expect that all of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options or settlement of RSUs, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will be registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be freely tradable in the public market upon issuance subject to applicable vesting requirements.\nIn addition, certain holders of our Class A common stock are, subject to certain conditions, entitled, under contracts providing for registration rights, to require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States.\nWe may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, or otherwise. Any further issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our company, the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our company, our market, and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on our company on a regular basis, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our market price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Washington law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control of our company that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablished a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\neliminated the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent unless the consent is unanimous, which requires all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nestablished advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at annual shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding shares;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nauthorized the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a shareholder rights plan, also known as a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\nIn addition, under Washington law, shareholders of public companies can act by written consent only by obtaining unanimous written consent. This limit on the ability of our shareholders to act by less than unanimous consent may lengthen the amount of time required to take shareholder action.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in the State of Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (\u201cWBCA\u201d), which prohibits a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cacquiring person,\u201d which is defined as a person or group of persons who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting securities of the \u201ctarget corporation,\u201d for a period of five years following the date on which the shareholder became an \u201cacquiring person.\u201d\nAny of these provisions of our charter documents or Washington law could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our Class A common stock. See the section titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation designate the federal and state courts located within the State of Washington as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the federal courts located in the State of Washington are the sole and exclusive forum for claims under the Securities Act, and the federal and state courts located within the State of Washington (\u201cWashington Courts\u201d), are the sole and exclusive forum for any internal corporate proceedings (as defined in the WBCA), subject to such courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the claim not being one that is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than in Washington Courts, or for which the Washington Courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for internal corporate proceedings, which may discourage such lawsuits even though an action, if successful, might benefit our shareholders. Shareholders who do bring a claim in Washington Courts could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near the State of Washington. Washington Courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a shareholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our shareholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17701, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SMAR"}
