{"cik": "83246", "company": "HSBC USA INC /MD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion provides a description of the most significant risk factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in public statements or documents. Some of these risk factors are inherent in the financial services industry and others are more specific to our own businesses. There are also other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and, therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of all potential risks that we may face.\nMacroeconomic Risk\nMarket and economic conditions will continue to affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Our business and earnings are affected by general business, economic and market conditions in the United States and abroad. There can be no assurance that the global economy as a whole will continue to improve. Given our concentration of business activities in the United States, we are particularly exposed to downturns in the economy, including housing, high unemployment, the availability of credit and liquidity and reduced economic growth. While the U.S. economy continued to grow during 2018, uncertainty concerning the future economic environment increased significantly during the fourth quarter. General business, economic and market conditions that could continue to affect us include:\n\u2022\nlevel of economic growth, including the pace and magnitude of such growth;\n\u2022\npressure on and changes in consumer confidence, spending and behavior;\n\u2022\nfiscal policy;\n\u2022\nvolatility in energy prices, including oil and gas prices;\n\u2022\nvolatility in credit markets;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels;\n\u2022\ntrends in corporate earnings;\n\u2022\nwage income levels and declines in wealth;\n\u2022\nmarket value of residential and commercial real estate throughout the United States;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nmonetary supply and monetary policy;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets in which we fund our operations;\n\u2022\nconsequences of unexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters, pandemics or acts of war or terrorism;\n\u2022\ntrade policy;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nmovements in short-term and long-term interest rates or a change in the shape of the yield curve;\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates, which may lead to increased delinquencies and loan impairment charges;\n\u2022\navailability of liquidity;\n\u2022\navailability of credit; and\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or regulatory and law enforcement initiatives.\nAlthough the U.S. economy in general continued to grow in 2018, if businesses were again to become cautious to hire, lay-off employees or reduce hours for employees, losses could be significant in all types of our consumer loans due to decreased consumer income. In addition, on-going domestic and global policy issues, such as trade disputes and the decision by the U.K. to exit the EU and the implications of those events could potentially impact the capital markets and trade as well as corporate earnings which would significantly impact our commercial loan performance. The sustainability of economic growth will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. In the event economic conditions begin to decline and lead to a recession, there would be a significant negative impact on delinquencies, charge-offs and losses in all loan portfolios with a corresponding impact on our results of operations.\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our financial planning products and services.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nMacro-prudential, regulatory and legal risks to our business model\nFederal, state, local and other similar international measures to regulate the financial industry may significantly impact our operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment. Changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting banking, derivatives, capital, liquidity, consumer credit, bankruptcy, privacy, consumer protection or other matters, could materially impact our operations and performance.\nAttempts by local, state and federal regulatory agencies to address perceived problems with the mortgage lending and credit card industries could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of products we can offer, how these products may be originated, the fees and charges that may be applied to accounts and how accounts may be collected or security interests enforced. Any one or more of these effects could negatively impact our results. There is also significant focus on loss mitigation and foreclosure activity for real estate loans. We cannot fully anticipate the response by national regulatory agencies, state Attorneys General, or certain legislators, nor can we anticipate whether significant changes to our operations and practices will be required as a result.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit, payment and other consumer financial products and services. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may also narrow the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expand the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's potential expansion of the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, we could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries, including HSBC Bank USA, have registered as swap dealers and are now subject to extensive oversight by the CFTC. Regulation of swap dealers by the CFTC imposes numerous corporate governance, business conduct, capital, margin, reporting, clearing, execution and other regulatory requirements on HSBC Bank USA. Additionally, certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries, including HSBC Bank USA, may in the future be required to register as security-based swap dealers and become subject to extensive oversight by the SEC, including the imposition of parallel corporate governance, business conduct, reporting and other regulatory requirements for security-based swaps. Imposition of these requirements may adversely affect our derivatives business and make us less competitive or make certain derivative products less profitable to undertake. Although many significant regulations applicable to swap dealers are already in effect and have imposed significant costs on our derivatives business, we continue to assess current regulation, proposed or expected changes to existing requirements, and the potential impact of future security-based swap requirements.\nThe Volcker Rule limits the ability of banking entities such as HUSI to sponsor or invest in certain private equity or hedge funds or engage in certain types of proprietary trading. See Part I, \"Regulation and Competition - The \"Volcker Rule\",\" in this Form 10-K.\nIn May 2018, U.S. regulatory agencies issued a proposal to modify numerous aspects of the Volcker Rule. Given that HSBC North America has more than $10 billion in trading assets and liabilities, it would still be subject to the highest expectations under the Volcker Rule. While the proposed modifications are intended to streamline the existing requirements and result in a more workable revised final rule, any changes to the existing Volcker Rule may result in increased compliance and operational costs, especially in connection with any modifications to the quantitative metrics reporting requirements. We continue to assess the potential impact of these proposed changes if they are adopted.\nThe FRB has also adopted rules to implement certain enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and has issued proposals to implement the early remediation requirements established under the Dodd-Frank Act. The FRB adopted enhanced standards relating to risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management and stress test requirements. The FRB has also issued final rules requiring covered entities to undergo annual stress tests conducted by the FRB and conduct their own \"company-run\" stress tests in conjunction with the CCAR program.\nOur parent, HSBC North America, is subject to assessment by the FRB as part of the CCAR program, which includes annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA must periodically conduct company-run stress tests as required under the DFAST. CCAR is an annual exercise by the FRB to ensure that institutions have forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their risks and sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. We cannot be certain that the FRB will have no objections to our 2019 or future capital plans submitted through the CCAR program, which is assessed by the FRB on both a quantitative and qualitative basis. If the FRB objects to our capital plan because we fail to meet either the quantitative or qualitative requirements, this could adversely affect our ability to make distributions, including dividends on our preferred stock, or to enter into acquisitions. We may fail to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests. If our stress testing projections differ significantly from our peers or the FRB objects to HSBC North America's capital plan, this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation since CCAR and DFAST results are made public. See Part I, \"Regulation and Competition - Capital Planning and Stress Testing,\" in this Form 10-K. See also \"Our reputation has a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations\" below.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nThe total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will implement the Dodd-Frank Act through the promulgation of new regulations and revisions to existing regulations and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect our businesses and operations. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, the EU and in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Regulators in the EU and in the United Kingdom are in the midst of negotiating and implementing far-reaching programs of financial regulatory reform. Key areas in which reforms are in progress or under consideration include enhanced capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, changes in compensation practices (including tax levies), separation of retail and wholesale banking, the recovery and resolution of EU financial institutions, and measures to address systemic risk. Furthermore, certain large G-SIBs, including HSBC, have in recent years become subject to capital surcharges and other enhanced prudential requirements. In November 2018, the FSB identified HSBC as one of three G-SIBs that will remain subject to a 2 percent surcharge. The FRB's rules implementing the G-SIB surcharge in the United States would not impose additional capital requirements on us because the U.S. G-SIB surcharge will only apply to the eight largest U.S. banking organizations.\nOur ultimate parent HSBC is subject to the FSB's TLAC requirements for G-SIBs in the United Kingdom. The new standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require \"internal\" TLAC to be prepositioned (i.e., issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties). The purpose of this new standard is to ensure that G-SIBs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability, and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution. The new standard calls for all G-SIBs to be subject to TLAC requirements starting January 1, 2019, and to be fully phased in by January 1, 2022. The FRB adopted final rules implementing the FSB's TLAC standard in the United States in December 2016. The rules require, among other things, the U.S. IHCs of non-U.S. G-SIBs, including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of TLAC which would include minimum levels of Tier 1 capital and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019, without the benefit of a phase-in period. The TLAC rules also include 'clean holding company requirements' that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions that HSBC North America could engage in. The FSB's TLAC standard and the FRB's TLAC rules represent a significant expansion of the current regulatory capital framework. To support compliance when the TLAC rules become effective, HSBC North America has issued long-term debt and will be required to issue additional long-term debt in future periods. See Part I, \"Regulation and Competition - Capital Planning and Stress Testing,\" in this Form 10-K.\nThe implementation of regulations and rules promulgated by these bodies could result in additional costs or limit or restrict the way HSBC conducts its businesses in the EU and in the U.K. Furthermore, the potentially far-reaching effects of future changes in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement as a result of EU or U.K. legislation and regulation are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.\nThe delivery of our regulatory priorities is subject to execution risk. The financial services industry is currently facing an unprecedented period of scrutiny. Regulatory requests, legal matters and business initiatives all require a significant amount of time and resources to implement. The magnitude and complexity of projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk. Organizational change and external factors, including the challenging macroeconomic environment and the extent and pace of regulatory change also contribute to execution risk. These factors could adversely affect the successful delivery of our regulatory priorities.\nUncertainty surrounding the potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by the current Administration in the U.S. (the \"Administration\") that may directly impact financial institutions and the global economy. The current Administration has indicated that it would like to see further changes made to certain financial reform regulations, which has resulted in increased regulatory uncertainty. We continue to assess the potential impact this may have on financial and economic markets and on our business. Changes in federal policy and regulatory agencies are expected to occur over time through policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. The nature, timing and economic and political effects of potential future changes to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain. In addition, the Administration has indicated that it would like to amend U.S. immigration policies. If immigration policies were to restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we or other members of the HSBC Group have operations or conduct business, we could be adversely affected. While regulatory changes to date have not had a significant impact to our business, it is unclear what additional laws, regulations and policies may change and whether future changes or uncertainty surrounding future changes will adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our results of operations and financial condition.\nLawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings may continue and increase in the current economic and regulatory environment. In the ordinary course of business, HSBC USA and its affiliates are routinely named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current and/or former operations and are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and formal and informal proceedings, as described in Note\nHSBC USA Inc.\n28, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, remediation payments, injunctions and other relief. There is no certainty that the litigation will decrease in the near future, especially in the event of a resurgent recession or additional regulatory and law enforcement investigations and proceedings by federal and state governmental agencies.\nFinancial service providers are at risk of regulatory sanctions or fines related to conduct of business and financial crime. The incidence of regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial service firms is increasing, with a corresponding increase also in civil litigation arising from or relating to issues which are subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions or fines. In the current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the financial services industry, there may be additional regulatory investigations and reviews conducted by banking and other regulators, including the CFPB, CFTC, state Attorneys General or state regulatory and law enforcement agencies that, if determined adversely, may result in judgments, settlements, substantial fines, penalties, remediation payments or other results, including additional compliance requirements, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. In addition, HSBC's extensive global operations also increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs. For example, operations in emerging markets, including facilitating cross-border transactions on behalf of its clients, subjects it to higher compliance risks under U.S. regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate activities, including AML laws and regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and economic sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). These risks can be more acute in less developed markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of our affiliates' business activities. Criminal prosecutions of financial institutions for, among other alleged conduct, breaches of AML laws and regulations, the FCPA, economic sanctions programs, antitrust violations, market manipulation, aiding and abetting tax evasion, and providing unlicensed cross-border banking services, have become more commonplace and may increase in frequency due to increased media attention and higher expectations from prosecutors and the public. Any such prosecution or investigation of, or legal proceeding or regulatory action brought against, HSBC or one or more of its subsidiaries could result in substantial fines, penalties and/or forfeitures and could have a material adverse effect on our results, business and prospects, including the potential loss of key licenses, requirement to exit certain businesses and withdrawal of funding from depositors and other stakeholders.\nWe establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Notwithstanding, we may incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. It is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of many of the legal, regulatory and other adversarial proceedings involving our businesses, particularly those cases in which matters are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, those which seek unspecified damages or those which involve novel legal claims. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties may use us as a conduit for illegal activities without our knowledge, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with applicable AML laws and regulations, the FCPA and economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, and we have adopted various policies and procedures, including 'Know Your Customer' procedures and other internal controls, that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable AML, anti-bribery/anti-corruption and economic sanctions requirements and aimed at preventing the use of our products and services for the purpose of committing or concealing financial crime. In relevant situations, and where permitted by regulation, we may rely upon certain counterparties, including our affiliates, to maintain and properly apply their own appropriate policies and procedures relating to financial crime compliance (including AML, anti-bribery/anti-corruption and economic sanctions). A major focus of U.S. government policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating financial crime activity, including money laundering, bribery and corruption and enforcing compliance with economic sanctions.\nA program consisting of policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with financial crime laws may not always prevent third parties from using us (and our relevant counterparties) as a conduit for money laundering, including illegal cash operations without our knowledge (and that of our relevant counterparties), or committing acts of bribery or violations of economic sanctions through us. As discussed above, becoming a party to violations of financial crime laws or regulations, or accusations of being associated with such activity, could damage our reputation and/or lead to fines, sanctions and/or legal enforcement. Any one of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory requirements in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the future orderly resolution of large financial institutions could negatively impact our business structures, activities and practices. The Dodd-Frank Act requires HSBC as a foreign bank holding company and our ultimate parent to prepare and submit an annual resolution plan (\"SIFI Plan\"). The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on reducing risks to the U.S. financial system, requiring a plan to demonstrate how the relevant entities can be resolved in a \"rapid and orderly\" fashion in a manner that avoids systemic risks. Similarly, HSBC Bank USA must prepare and submit an annual resolution plan (\"IDI Plan\"). HSBC Bank USA is required to regularly provide a plan to the FDIC that is executable for resolving the bank in the event of its failure that protects depositors, maximizes the net present value return on assets and minimizes the amount of any losses to creditors, including the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund. These plans must include\nHSBC USA Inc.\ninformation on resolution strategy, agreements with major counterparties and \"interdependencies,\" among other things. Resolution planning requires substantial effort, time and cost across all of our businesses and geographies. The HSBC SIFI Plan is subject to review by both the FRB and the FDIC and the HSBC Bank USA IDI Plan is subject to review by the FDIC. In 2018, HSBC and HSBC Bank USA submitted their latest annual plans.\nIf the FRB and the FDIC both determine that a SIFI Plan is not \"credible\" (which, although not defined, is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plans are feasible or would otherwise allow resolution of a financial institution's U.S. businesses in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss), and the deficiencies are not remedied within the required time period, an institution, including HSBC, could be required to restructure or reorganize businesses, legal entities, or operational systems and intra-company transactions in ways that could negatively impact operations, or be subject to restrictions on growth. HSBC could also eventually be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or be required to divest certain assets or operations.\nU.S. federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital, total loss absorbing capacity, long-term debt or liquidity requirements which could result in the need to issue additional qualifying securities or to take other actions, such as liquidate assets. HSBC North America is required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance, in accordance with current regulatory timelines.\nIn the current regulatory environment, capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended. Our regulators may increase regulatory minimum or buffer requirements, change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. A significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our risk-weighted assets, including operational risk, and our leverage exposure which may increase. The Basel Committee has also revised several key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets, including a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk, and constraints on the use of internal models as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches in addition to a new final standard on the minimum capital requirements for market risk. The federal banking agencies may update the U.S. Basel III rule to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions.\nAdditionally, in April 2016, the U.S. banking regulators proposed NSFR requirements which target longer-term liquidity risk and would apply to HSBC North America and HSBC USA Bank. These and other future regulatory or legislative proposals could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as HSBC North America, as well as our ability to meet these requirements.\nIncreases in regulatory capital may also be required in response to other U.S. supervisory requirements. Participation by HSBC North America in the FRB's CCAR stress test process also requires that HSBC North America maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum regulatory ratios in a forward-looking stress scenario across a nine-quarter planning horizon. The FRB has also indicated that it is considering a new measure to replace the capital conservation buffer with a \"stress capital buffer,\" which would equal a bank holding company's projected decline in its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse stress testing scenarios plus one year of planned common stock dividends. The \"stress capital buffer\" would be reset annually based on the bank holding company's DFAST results under the supervisory stress tests. The stress capital buffer would be subject to a floor of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets in line with the current capital conservation buffer rules. We are reviewing these possible changes to the capital conservation buffer in anticipation of the formal rulemaking and their potential impact on our capital planning processes specifically and our operations and results generally. We may be prohibited from taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends, or repurchasing securities if the FRB objects to our CCAR capital plan. We currently target internal capital levels using an approach analogous to the stress capital buffer and, therefore, we do not expect the proposal to have a significant impact on our U.S. operations or change our capital planning processes. The exact amount, however, will depend upon our prevailing risk profile and those of our North America affiliates under various stress scenarios.\nHSBC Bank USA is also required to participate in the OCC's DFAST. These stress testing requirements will influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.\nPreparation for the U.S. implementation of the Basel Committee's revisions to Basel III has influenced and is likely to continue to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and is expected to impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. We are unable at this time to determine the extent of changes we will need to make to our liquidity or capital position, if any, and what effect, if any, such changes will have on our results of operations or financial condition. New regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital and may require us to increase our capital or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results. Changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity or other securities, cease or alter certain operations, sell company assets, or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur interpretation or application of the tax laws to which we are subject could differ from those of the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in the payment of additional taxes and penalties. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax\nHSBC USA Inc.\nLegislation\"), which was enacted in December 2017, is subject to clarification and interpretation through currently proposed and future additional regulatory and administrative guidance. Additionally, it is not clear how the Tax Legislation will impact our clients. We are subject to the various tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are inherently complex and we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to the HSBC North America entities, operations and businesses. Our interpretations and application of the tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, which could result in the potential for the payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, which could be material. For example, the Tax Legislation contains certain complex provisions such as the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax which may have a material impact in current and future periods on income tax expense for the HSBC North America consolidated tax group of which we are a member, depending upon, among other things, the interpretation and finalization of recently proposed regulations, other interpretive guidance which may be issued, actions HSBC North America or its affiliates may take as a result of the Tax Legislation and related guidance, and the future earnings of HUSI and other subsidiaries of HSBC North America. It is also not yet clear how the Tax Legislation will impact our clients and there is a risk that the Tax Legislation could have a material impact on our commercial relationship with those clients.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses as a result of foreign exchange-related investigations. Regulatory and law enforcement agencies globally are currently investigating HSBC Group in connection with alleged misconduct relating to manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The extent of our financial exposure to these matters could be material, and our reputation may suffer material harm as a result.\nRisks related to our business, business operations, governance and internal control systems\nOur reputation may have a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations. Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees, and conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation, or the reputation of affiliates operating under the HSBC brand, is damaged. Reputational risk relates to stakeholders' perceptions, whether fact-based or otherwise. Stakeholders' expectations change constantly and so reputational risk is dynamic and varies between geographical regions, groups and individuals. Any material lapse in standards of integrity, compliance, customer service or operating efficiency may represent a potential reputational risk.\nOur failure to address, or to appear to fail to address, various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to us and our business prospects. Reputational issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nnegative news about us, HSBC, our affiliates or the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nethical issues, including potential conflicts of interest and the acceptance or receipt of gifts and entertainment, as well as potential violations under the FCPA;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nalleged deceptive or unfair lending or pricing practices;\n\u2022\nAML and economic sanctions programs;\n\u2022\nfraud and misappropriation of assets;\n\u2022\nprivacy and data security intrusions related to our customers or employees;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity issues and cyber incidents, whether actual, threatened, or perceived;\n\u2022\nrecordkeeping;\n\u2022\nsales and trading practices;\n\u2022\ncustomer service;\n\u2022\nactions of a vendor or other third party, including a subcontractor, we do business with;\n\u2022\nthe proper identification of the legal, credit, liquidity, operational and market risks inherent in our businesses;\n\u2022\nalleged irregularities in servicing, foreclosure, consumer collections, mortgage lending practices and loan modifications;\n\u2022\na downgrade of or negative watch warning on any of our credit ratings; and\n\u2022\ngeneral company performance.\nThe proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, facilitates communication with large audiences in short time frames. These social media websites, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets.\nThe failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address any of these issues appropriately could make our customers unwilling to do business with us or give rise to increased regulatory action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nOur risk management measures may not be successful. The management of risk is an integral part of all our activities. Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. Risks have the potential to affect the results of our operations or financial condition. Specifically, risk equates to the adverse effect on profitability or financial condition arising from different sources of uncertainty including retail and wholesale credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk including legal, financial crime compliance, regulatory compliance, accounting, tax, fiduciary, information security, security fraud, people, systems, political contingency, projects, and operations risks, liquidity and funding risk, reputational risk, strategic risk, model risk, sustainability risk, and pension obligation risk. To manage risk, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. The framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It also strives to ensure that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While our risk management framework employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every unfavorable event or the specifics and timing of every outcome. Failure to manage risks appropriately could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management measures may face particularly significant challenges in the following three broad areas:\n(a) Macroeconomic and geo-political risks: Unfavorable economic and market conditions may adversely affect our results.\n(b) Risks related to our businesses, business operations, governance, and internal systems: The delivery of our strategic priorities is subject to execution risk and we may not achieve all the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives. Our operations are subject to the threat of fraudulent activity and disruption from the external environment. We are highly dependent on our information technology systems. We could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure. Issues with the quality of data or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting.\n(c) Regulatory and legal risks to our businesses: We are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict, but unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and brand. Unfavorable legislative or regulatory developments, or changes in the policy of regulators or governments, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFailure to implement our business strategies may adversely affect our financial performance. Our strategies for business growth includes focusing our sales efforts on international connectivity strategies with high quality internationally minded clients as well as augmenting our returns through increased cross-selling and cost optimization. The development and implementation of our strategy requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions in various parts of the world. We may fail to correctly identify the trends we seek to exploit and the relevant factors in making decisions as to capital deployment and cost reduction, and our ability to execute our strategy may also be limited by our operational capacity and the increasing complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate. Further, we may fail to attract internationally mobile clients or cross-sell our services to them. See \"-Our \"cross-selling\" efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy, and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results.\" The work required to execute on our growth strategies is substantial. Alongside the strategic actions, we continue to implement a number of externally driven regulatory remediation programs. The magnitude and complexity of the projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk. Additionally, we may be unable to fully realize the cost optimization efforts and the other anticipated benefits from those efforts and we may not be able to realize them in the currently anticipated timeframes.\nThe cumulative impact of the collective change initiatives underway is significant and has direct implications on resourcing and our people. Our ability to execute our strategy may also be limited by our operational capacity and the increasing complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate. In addition, factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, the economic and market conditions and other challenges discussed in detail above, could limit our ability to achieve all of the expected benefits of these initiatives. Failure to successfully implement our business strategies may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur \"cross-selling\" efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy, and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results. Selling more products to our customers - \"cross-selling\" - is very important to our business model and key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings. Key among these cross-sell opportunities is the collaboration between CMB and GB&M as well as referrals to PB from the other business lines, which is an area where many of our competitors also focus. In the retail banking sector, many of our competitors also focus on cross-selling, especially in retail banking and mortgage lending. In both instances, this competition within the industry can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices, reducing our net interest income and revenue from our fee-based products. It could also affect our ability to keep existing customers. New technologies could require\nHSBC USA Inc.\nus to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers. Our cross-sell strategy also is dependent on earning more business from our customers, and increasing our cross-sell ratio - or the average number of products sold to existing customers - which may become more challenging.\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. We are exposed to many types of operational risks that are inherent in banking operations, including fraudulent and other criminal activities (both internal and external), breakdowns in processes or procedures and systems failure or non-availability. For example, fraudsters may target any of our products, services and delivery channels including lending, internet banking, payments, bank accounts and cards. These risks apply equally when we rely on outside suppliers, outsourcing vendors and our affiliates to provide services to us and our customers. These operational risks may result in financial loss to us, an adverse customer experience, reputational damage and potential regulatory action depending on the circumstances of the event, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, there is a risk that our operating system controls as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to disruption from the external environment. We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems infrastructure arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include:\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, electrical, telecommunications, or other essential utility outages;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes or other severe weather conditions and earthquakes;\n\u2022\nevents arising from local, regional or international politics, including terrorist acts or acts of war; or\n\u2022\nabsence of operating systems personnel due to global pandemics or otherwise, which could have a significant effect on our business operations as well as on HSBC affiliates world-wide.\nSuch disruptions may give rise to losses in service or disruption to customers, an inability to collect our receivables in affected areas, physical damage or loss of life and other loss or liability to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nA failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. Data quality and integrity are critical for decision making, enterprise risk management and operational processes, as well as for complying with applicable regulation. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process a large number of complex transactions, most of which involve, in some fashion, networked computing devices. If any of our financial, accounting, data processing or other recordkeeping systems and management controls fail, or are subject to cyberattack that could compromise integrity, availability or confidentiality of our systems or data, we could be materially adversely affected.\nCyber vulnerability continues to be leveraged by cyber criminals to perpetrate crimes at an increasing rate, often exceeding traditional offense, and poses a significant threat to economic, social and geopolitical stability for private firms and countries. HSBC faces sophisticated cyber threats from state-sponsored attackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and other threat actors seeking our critical corporate and customer information.\nIn recent years, distributed denial of service attacks, spearphishing campaigns, advanced malware, ransomware attacks, social engineering and insider threats have grown in volume and level of sophistication each with the intent to obtain personal customer financial information or proprietary corporate information, disrupt availability of services and to commit fraud. Such acts can affect our business by:\n\u2022\ncompromising the confidentiality or integrity of our customers' data, potentially impacting our customers' ability to repay loan balances and negatively impacting their credit ratings;\n\u2022\ncompromising the security of and confidence in our payment channels;\n\u2022\nputting our customers at risk for identity theft, account takeover and credit abuse;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur remediation and other costs related to liability for customer or third parties for losses, repairs to remedy systems flaws, or incentives to customers and business partners to maintain and rebuild business relationships after the attack;\n\u2022\nincreasing our costs to respond to such threats and to enhance our processes and systems to ensure security of data;\n\u2022\ndamaging our reputation as a result of public disclosure of a breach of our systems or a loss of data event;\n\u2022\nresulting in unauthorized disclosure or alteration of our corporate confidential information and confidential information of employees, customers and counterparties;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our customers' or third parties' business operations; and\n\u2022\nresulting in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nThe threat from cyberattacks, on us and on third party vendors on which we rely, is a concern for our organization and failure to protect our operations from internet crime or cyberattacks may result in financial loss and loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine our reputation and our ability to attract and keep customers. We face various cyber risks in line with other multinational financial organizations. We and other multinational financial organizations have been, and will continue to be subject to an increasing risk of cyber incidents from these activities due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet and customers' use of personal smartphones, PCs and other computing devices, tablet PCs and other mobile devices to access products and services to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime for seeking financial gain, hacktivists (geopolitical designated groups), cyber terrorists (attacks against critical infrastructure) and state sponsored advanced persistent threats, sometimes referred to as APTs, for corporate espionage. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, HSBC Group's prominent size and scale, geographical span and role in the financial services industry, and our offering of Internet banking and mobile banking platforms that seek to serve our customers when and how they want to be served. In addition, the consolidation of clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of financial institutions with such central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the exposure of cyberattacks on critical parties that may affect us. Evaluating and monitoring the cyber threat landscape in comparison to our existing capabilities, and adjusting our programs in order to respond to these threats, may require additional capital expenses for human resources and technology.\nIn October 2018, malicious actors used credentials sourced from a breach of a third party unrelated to HSBC Bank USA to attempt to access accounts of its customers. Because some of the customers had used the same credentials for access to the breached third party services and their accounts at HSBC Bank USA, the malicious actors were able to gain access to a small number of customer accounts at HSBC Bank USA including the name of the account holder, account types, account balances and transactions of the affected accounts. This incident did not result in material financial loss.\nOur businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security (including cybersecurity) from time to time.\nConcentrations of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses. We have exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. While we regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks, our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. As an international bank, we have exposure to commercial customers domiciled outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to various other non-domestic risks including geopolitical risk, international trade flow disruptions, and deterioration/volatility in global economies and markets. Disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of any of the industries, products, financial markets or economies we operate in may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of our positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations.\nOur inability to meet funding requirements due to deposit attrition or access to the capital markets. HSBC USA is a holding company without operations of its own and therefore relies on dividends and other distributions for a portion of its funding and liquidity. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our subsidiaries may pay. Our primary source of funding is deposits, augmented by issuance of commercial paper and term debt. Adequate liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses.\nWe also access wholesale markets in order to provide funding for entities that do not accept deposits, to align asset and liability maturities and currencies and to maintain a market presence. We issued a total of $11,923 million of long-term debt at various points in 2018. An inability to obtain financing in the unsecured long-term or short-term debt capital markets because of market factors or factors in our businesses could have a substantial adverse effect on our liquidity. Unfavorable macroeconomic developments, market disruptions or regulatory developments may increase our funding costs or challenge our ability to raise funds to support our businesses, materially adversely affecting our businesses, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nDespite the apparent improvements in overall market liquidity and our liquidity position, future conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include:\n\u2022\nan inability to maintain stable deposit balances because customers may invest in other financial instruments as an alternative;\n\u2022\ndiminished access to capital markets because of market factors or factors in our businesses;\n\u2022\nan increased interest rate environment for our commercial paper, deposits or term debt;\n\u2022\nunforeseen cash or capital requirements;\n\u2022\nan inability to sell assets; and\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain expected funding from HSBC Group subsidiaries and through deposits.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nThese conditions could be caused by a number of factors, including internal and external factors, such as, among others:\n\u2022\nfinancial and credit market disruption;\n\u2022\nvolatility or lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets;\n\u2022\nlack of market or customer confidence in HSBC or negative news about HSBC or the financial services industry generally; and\n\u2022\nother conditions and factors over which we have little or no control including economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and concerns over potential government defaults and related policy initiatives.\nOur approach is to meet our capital needs locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent, however, that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek their support. HSBC has provided us with capital support in the past. Notwithstanding, if we are unable to maintain stable deposit balances and/or raise funds in the capital markets, our liquidity position could be adversely affected and we might be unable to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, or to fund new loans, investments and businesses. We may need to liquidate unencumbered assets to meet our liabilities. In a time of reduced liquidity, we may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we may need to sell assets at depressed prices, which in either case could materially adversely affect our businesses, prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funding. Our credit ratings are an important part of maintaining our liquidity. We depend on access to the securities market for a portion of our funding. We issued a total of $11,923 million of long-term debt in 2018. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, which consider a number of factors including their assessment of our relative financial strength and results of operations, including our strategy and our management's capability, as well as factors affecting the financial services industry generally, including legal and regulatory frameworks affecting our business activities and the rights of our creditors. There can be no assurance that downgrades will not occur. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could potentially increase our borrowing costs, impact our ability to issue commercial paper and, depending on the severity of the downgrade, substantially limit our access to capital markets, require us to make cash payments or post collateral and permit termination by counterparties of certain significant contracts. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts.\nRating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which may lead to adverse ratings actions. Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At December 31, 2018, there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies.\nWe may suffer losses due to employee negligence, fraud or misconduct. Non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct, negligence and fraud could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. We are dependent on our employees and could be materially adversely affected if an employee or employees, acting alone or in concert with non-affiliated third parties, causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. In recent years, a number of multinational financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of 'rogue traders' or other employees. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective. Employee misconduct could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may suffer losses due to negligence, fraud or misconduct by third parties. We depend on third party suppliers, outsourcing vendors and our affiliates for a variety of services. Third parties with which we do business with could be sources of operational risk to us, including risks relating to break-downs or failures of such parties' own systems or employees. The OCC and FRB require financial institutions to maintain third party and service provider risk management programs, which include due diligence requirements for third parties and service providers as well as for our affiliates who may perform services for us. Under FRB guidance \"service providers\" is broadly defined to include all entities that have entered into a contractual relationship with a financial institution to provide business functions or activities. If our third party risk and service provider management and due diligence program is not sufficiently robust, this could lead to regulatory intervention. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, and may result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage or regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nFailure to successfully change our operational practices may have a material impact on our businesses. Changes to operational practices from time to time could materially impact our performance and results. Such changes may include:\n\u2022\nour determining to sell residential mortgage loans and other loans;\n\u2022\nchanges to our customer account management and risk management/collection policies and practices;\n\u2022\nour investment choices in technology, business infrastructure and specialized personnel;\nHSBC USA Inc.\n\u2022\nchanges to our AML and sanctions policies and the related operations practices;\n\u2022\nour outsourcing of various operations, including our mortgage servicing business; or\n\u2022\nthe decision to insource certain products, services or operations.\nFurther, in order to react quickly to or meet newly-implemented regulatory requirements, we may need to change or enhance systems within very tight time frames, which would increase operational risk. Failure to implement appropriate changes to our operational practices successfully and efficiently may diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses and could result in reputational damage and regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nFederal Reserve Board policies can significantly affect business and economic conditions and, as a result, our financial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and derivative instruments. The FRB's policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that such borrowers may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict.\nOur data management and policies and processes may not be sufficiently robust. Critical business processes across the HSBC Group rely on large volumes of data from a number of different systems and sources. If data governance, data quality and data architecture policies and procedures are not sufficiently robust, manual intervention, adjustments and reconciliations may be required to reduce the risk of error in reporting to senior management or regulators. Inadequate policies and processes may also affect our ability to use data to service customers more effectively and/or improve our product offering. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nMoreover, financial institutions that fail to comply with regulatory reporting requirements established by their regulators or with the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as set out by the Basel Committee may face supervisory measures. Any of these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that continues to undergo significant change as a result of financial regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from the financial crisis and the challenging economic conditions that followed. We target internationally mobile clients who need sophisticated global solutions and we generally compete on the basis of the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers' needs, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. Additionally, if our products and services are not accepted by our targeted clients, this may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the current economic, regulatory, and political environment for large financial institutions such as us, and possible public backlash to bank fees, there is increased competitive pressure to provide products and services at current or lower prices. Consequently, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the actions of our competitors who may or may not charge similar fees for their products and services. Any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customers and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, new technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers. Continued technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic payment solutions. We may not respond effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to increase our investment in our businesses to modify or adapt our existing products and services or develop new products and services to respond to our customers' needs. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant exposure to counterparty risk. We are exposed to counterparties that are involved in virtually all major industries, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in financial services, including brokers and dealers, central clearing counterparties, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. Our ability to engage in routine transactions to fund our operations and manage our risks could be materially adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. Financial institutions are necessarily interdependent because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a consequence, a default by, or decline in market confidence in, individual institutions, or anxiety about the financial services industry generally, can lead to further individual and/or systemic difficulties, defaults and losses.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nMandatory central clearing of over the counter derivatives, including under the Dodd-Frank Act, brings with it risk. As a clearing member, we have financial exposure for losses incurred at a Central Counterparty (\"CCP\") by the default of other clearing members. Hence increased moves toward central clearing brings with it a further element of interconnectedness between clearing members and clients that we believe may increase rather than reduce our exposure to systemic risk. At the same time, our ability to manage such risk ourselves will be reduced because risk controls are largely managed by the CCPs themselves and it is unclear at present how, at a time of stress, regulators and resolution authorities would intervene.\nIn situations in which we strive to mitigate counterparty risk by taking collateral, our credit risk may remain high if the collateral we hold cannot be realized or must be liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure to the respective counterparty. There is a risk that collateral cannot be realized, including situations where this arises by change of law that may influence our ability to foreclose on collateral or otherwise enforce contractual rights.\nWe also have credit exposure arising from risk defeasance products such as credit default swaps (\"CDSs\"), and other credit derivatives, each of which is carried at fair value. The risk of default by counterparties to CDSs and other credit derivatives used as mitigants affects the fair value of these instruments depending on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the underlying instrument against which protection has been purchased. Any such adjustments or fair value changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial condition of our clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect us. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that we could incur in our market-making and clearing businesses.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a consequence, a default by, or decline in market confidence in, individual institutions, or anxiety about the financial services industry generally, can lead to further individual and/or systemic difficulties, defaults and losses. HSBC routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. When such a counterparty or client becomes bankrupt or insolvent, we may become involved in significant disputes or litigation with the counterparty's or client's bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations, each of which could increase our operational and litigation costs.\nSignificant or prolonged periods of market stress or illiquidity could further decrease our ability to realize the fair value of collateral held by us or make it more likely that we would liquidate collateral at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure to the respective counterparty or client. Further, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity.\nIncreased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. The credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices and higher unemployment, or other factors. For example, changes in borrower behavior or the regulatory environment also could influence recognition of credit losses in the portfolio and our allowance for credit losses.\nWhile we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2018, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event of a deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings.\nFinancial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may negatively affect our servicing and investment portfolios. Our servicing portfolio includes certain mortgage loans that carry some level of insurance from one or more mortgage insurance companies. To the extent that any of these companies experience financial difficulties or credit downgrades, we may be required, as servicer of the insured loan on behalf of the investor, to obtain replacement coverage with another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we would replace. We may be responsible for some or all of the incremental cost of the new coverage for certain loans depending on the terms of our servicing agreement with the investor and other circumstances, although we do not have an additional risk of repurchase loss associated with claim amounts for loans sold to third-party investors. Similarly, some of the mortgage loans we hold for investment or for sale carry mortgage insurance. If a\nHSBC USA Inc.\nmortgage insurer is unable to meet its credit obligations with respect to an insured loan, we might incur higher credit losses if replacement coverage is not obtained. We also have investments in municipal bonds that are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. The value of these bonds and the payment of principal and interest on them may be negatively affected by financial difficulties or credit downgrades experienced by the bond insurers.\nThe manner in which we hold, service and enforce residential mortgage loans in our portfolio may be challenged. We are subject to certain legal and contractual requirements for how we hold, transfer, use or enforce promissory notes, security instruments and other documents for residential mortgage loans that we service. In recent years, challenges have been raised to whether we have adhered to these requirements, and whether, as a result in some instances, the loans can be enforced as local law otherwise would permit. Additionally, we currently use the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) system for approximately half of the residential mortgage loans that remain in our servicing portfolio. Individual borrowers and certain local governments have contended that the use of MERS is improper or otherwise adversely affects the security interest. If documentation requirements were not met, or if the use of MERS or the MERS system is found not valid or effective, we could be obligated to, or choose to, take remedial actions and may be subject to additional costs or losses.\nFailure to meet regulatory requirements and expectations in the U.S. regarding sales practices and incentive compensation programs could negatively impact our customers, our business and reputation. Our remuneration practices and performance management framework are designed to prevent and deter conflicts of interest and inappropriate sales incentives. Additionally, our other sales controls, including our framework for handling customer and employee complaints regarding sales practices, are designed to ensure customers receive products that they have authorized and meet their needs. Failure to execute our sales controls could result in the sale of, or upgrade to, products and services that fail to meet the needs of, or are unsuitable for, customers and clients, and can lead to financial harm to our customers, regulatory sanctions, financial loss and reputational damage.\nWe may not manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark rates effectively. The expected replacement of benchmarks, including the key London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") with alternative benchmark rates introduces a number of risks for us, our clients, and the financial services industry more widely. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\u2022\nLegal risks, as changes required to documentation for new and existing transactions may be required;\n\u2022\nFinancial risks, arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark rates;\n\u2022\nPricing risks, as changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some instruments;\n\u2022\nOperational risks, due to the potential requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure, operational processes and controls; and\n\u2022\nConduct risks, through potential material, adverse, impact on customers or financial markets, and engagement during the transition period.\nThe benchmark specifications together with the timetable and mechanisms for implementation have not yet been agreed across the industry and regulatory authorities. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would affect us. However, the implementation of alternative benchmark rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, customers and operations.\nWe could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure. We use models for a range of purposes in managing our businesses, including regulatory capital calculations, stress testing, credit approvals, financial crime and fraud risk management and financial reporting. We could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions, which may lead to actions by management, based on models that are poorly developed, implemented or used, or as a result of the modeled outcome being misunderstood or the use of such information for purposes for which it was not designed. We hold capital for known risks and limitations of our models as appropriate. If additional weakness in a model is discovered or if a model is shown to have failed, we may be required to hold more capital. Risks arising from use of models could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and/or results of operations, minimum capital requirements and reputation.\nRegulatory scrutiny and supervisory concerns over the use by banks of models is considerable, particularly the internal models and assumptions used by banks in the application of the stress testing exercise and in the calculation of regulatory capital.\nManagement projections, estimates and judgments based on historical performance may not be indicative of our future performance. Our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine loan loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangibles, among other items. In particular, loan loss reserve estimates and certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management's judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control. To the extent historical averages of the progression of loans into stages of delinquency or the amount of loss realized upon charge-off are not predictive of future losses and management is unable to accurately evaluate the portfolio risk factors not fully reflected in historical models, unexpected additional losses could result. Similarly, to the extent assumptions employed in measuring fair value of assets and liabilities not supported by market prices or other observable parameters do not sufficiently capture their inherent risk, unexpected additional losses could result.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans, future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates and the application of inherently complex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Note 16, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our deferred tax assets.\nOur financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any \"material weaknesses\" in our internal control over financial reporting. In a company as large and complex as ours, lapses or deficiencies, including significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and we cannot assure you that we will not find one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given year.\nChanges in accounting standards are beyond our control and may have a material impact on how we report our financial results and condition. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB, the IASB, the SEC and our bank regulators, including the OCC and the FRB, change the financial accounting and reporting standards, or the interpretation thereof, and guidance that govern the preparation and disclosure of external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report and disclose our financial results and condition, including our segment results. For example, the FASB's new guidance on expected credit losses will likely, among other things, significantly change how we measure credit impairment on our loan portfolios, which will also affect the level of deferred tax assets that we recognize. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. We may, in certain instances, change a business practice in order to comply with new or revised standards. For further discussion see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nKey employees may be difficult to attract or retain due to talent available in the market and the improved economic environment. Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. Employee fatigue, relocations, and external competition targeting top talent could have impacts on attrition. If we were unable to continue to attract, develop and retain qualified key employees to support the various functions of our businesses, our performance, including our competitive position, could be impacted. Any future limitations on executive compensation imposed by legislation or regulation could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified employees. In the improved economic environment, we may face increased difficulty in retaining top performers and critical skilled employees. If key personnel were to leave us and equally knowledgeable or skilled personnel are unavailable within the HSBC Group or could not be sourced in the market, our ability to manage our businesses, in particular through any future difficult economic environment may be compromised.\nSignificant reductions in pension assets may require additional financial contributions from us. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan, which has been frozen. At December 31, 2018, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $302 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 20, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.", "PERMNO": 53938, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HBC2"}
