RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or other securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices fluctuate and declines in these prices, or an extended period of low prices, can significantly affect the value of our assets and our financial results and impede our growth.\nOur revenue, profitability, cash flows and liquidity depend in large part upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Changes in prices affect many aspects of our business, including:\n\u2022\nour revenue, profitability and cash flows;\n\u2022\nour liquidity;\n\u2022\nthe quantity and present value of our reserves;\n\u2022\nthe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and access to other sources of capital; and\n\u2022\nthe nature and scale of our operations.\nThe markets for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs are often volatile, and prices may fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u2022\nrelatively minor changes in regional, national, or global supply and demand;\n\u2022\nregional, national, or global economic conditions, and perceived trends in those conditions;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical factors, such as events that may reduce or increase production from particular oil-producing regions and/or from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC; and\n\u2022\nregulatory changes.\nThe price of oil has been volatile since mid-2014, with a high over $100 per barrel in June 2014 to lows below $30 per barrel in 2016, in each case based on WTI prices, due to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply, global economic concerns, and the resumption of oil exports from Iran. Prices for natural gas and NGLs have experienced similar volatility. Declines in prices adversely affect, among other things, our revenue and reserves, and have contributed to the recognition of impairment charges, including charges of $158.3 million and $150.3 million to write-down our Utica Shale producing and non-producing crude oil and natural gas properties to their estimated fair value in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Any future extended period of lower oil prices, or additional price declines, will have further adverse effects on us. For example, if we reduce our capital expenditures due to low prices, natural declines in production from our wells will likely result in reduced production and therefore reduced cash flow from operations, which would in turn further limit our ability to make the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves and production.\nIn addition to factors affecting the price of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs generally, the prices we receive for our production are affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where the production occurs. The prices that we receive for our production are generally lower than the relevant benchmark prices that are used for calculating commodity derivative positions. These differences, or differentials, are difficult to predict and may widen or narrow in the future based on market forces. Differentials can be influenced by, among other things, local or regional supply and demand factors and the terms of our sales contracts. Over the longer term, differentials will be significantly affected by factors such as investment decisions made by providers of midstream facilities and services, refineries and other industry participants, and the overall regulatory and economic climate. For example, increases in U.S. domestic oil production generally may result in widening differentials, particularly for production from some basins. We may be materially and adversely impacted by widening differentials on our production.\nThe Delaware Basin acquisitions may not achieve their intended results and may result in us assuming unanticipated liabilities.\nThe Delaware Basin acquisitions subject us to many of the risks described below in \u201cAcquisitions of properties are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities, including environmental uncertainties.\u201d For example, we may discover title defects or adverse environmental or other conditions relating to the properties acquired in the transactions of which we are currently unaware. Environmental, title, and other problems could reduce the value of the properties to us, and, depending on the circumstances, we could have limited or no recourse to the sellers with respect to those problems. We have assumed substantially all of the liabilities associated with the acquired properties and would be entitled to indemnification in connection with those liabilities in only limited circumstances, for limited periods and in limited amounts. We cannot provide assurance that such potential remedies will be adequate for any liabilities we incur, and such liabilities could be significant. Also, it is uncertain whether our existing operations and the acquired properties and assets can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. In addition, the success of the Delaware Basin acquisitions depend on, among other things, the accuracy of our assessment of the reserves and drilling locations associated with the acquired properties, future oil, NGL and natural gas prices and operating costs, and various other factors. The majority of the value was attributed to unproved leaseholds, which inherently have a higher risk of uncertainty than the acquisition of proved developed reserves. These assessments were based to a significant degree on information provided by the sellers and we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Although the acquired properties are subject to many of the risks and uncertainties to which acquisitions we pursue are subject generally, risks associated with the Delaware Basin acquisitions in particular include those associated with our ability to operate efficiently in a new area, the significant size of the transactions in the aggregate, the fact that a substantial majority of the acquired properties are undeveloped, and the additional indebtedness and transaction costs we incurred in connection with the acquisitions. Many of these risks also apply to acquisitions of additional Delaware Basin properties\nwe have pursued or may pursue in the future. In addition, we expect that pursuing our future development plans for the properties will require capital in excess of our projected cash flow from operations for some period of time beginning in 2017, which may increase our need for external financing.\nOur undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expiration to hold the acreage by production. In highly competitive markets for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage could result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of our drilling locations are identified, our leases for such acreage will expire. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As such, our actual drilling activities may differ materially from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business. These risks are greater at times and in areas where the pace of our exploration and development activity slows. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals, approvals of the Texas General Land Office for our Delaware Basin properties, and other factors. These risks are currently greater for us in the Delaware Basin area than in our other operating areas. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 30 percent of our total net acreage in the Delaware Basin was held-by-production or drilling operations. In addition, a substantial portion of our Utica Shale acreage is held-by-production by a third party operator\u2019s shallow vertical wells. Our relative lack of control over this acreage increases the risk that some of our leases will expire.\nBallot initiatives have been proposed in Colorado from time to time that could vastly expand the right of local governments to limit or prohibit oil and natural gas production and development in their jurisdictions and could impose additional regulations on production and development activities. If any initiative or legislation of this nature is implemented and survives legal challenge, additional limitations or prohibitions could be placed on crude oil, natural gas and NGL production and development within certain areas of Colorado or the state as a whole. Similar initiatives could be proposed in other states.\nDuring 2016, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development generally, or hydraulic fracturing in particular, advanced various options for ballot initiatives aimed at significantly limiting or effectively preventing oil and natural gas development in the state of Colorado. Proponents of two such initiatives attempted to qualify the initiatives to appear on the ballot for the November 2016 election. On August 29, 2016, the Colorado Secretary of State issued a press release and statements of insufficiency of signatures, stating that the proponents of the proposals had failed to collect enough valid signatures to have the proposals included on the ballot.\nOne of the initiatives, which we refer to as the \u201clocal control\u201d initiative, would have amended the state constitution to give city, town, and county governments the right to regulate, or to ban, oil and gas development and production within their boundaries, notwithstanding rules and approvals to the contrary at the state level. This proposal was motivated in part by a decision of the Colorado Supreme Court holding that local government restrictions on oil and gas activities are subject to preemption by state rules.\nA second initiative, which we refer to as the \u201csetback\u201d initiative, would have amended the state constitution to require all new oil and gas development facilities to be located at least 2,500 feet away from any occupied structure or broadly defined \u201carea of special concern,\u201d including public and community drinking water sources, lakes, rivers, perennial or intermittent streams, creeks, irrigation canals, riparian areas, playgrounds, permanent sports fields, amphitheaters, public parks, and public open space.\nIf implemented, the setback initiative would have effectively prohibited the vast majority of our planned future drilling activities in Colorado and would therefore have made it impossible to pursue our current development plans. The local control proposal would potentially have had a similar effect, depending on the nature and extent of regulations implemented by relevant local governmental authorities. Pursuant to the determination of the Colorado Secretary of State, these proposals did not appear on the November 2016 ballot. However, future proposals of this nature are possible.\nBecause a substantial portion of our operations and reserves are located in Colorado, the risks we face with respect to such future proposals are greater than those of our competitors with more geographically diverse operations. Although we cannot predict the outcome of future ballot initiatives, statutes, or regulatory developments, such developments could materially impact our results of operations, production, and reserves.\nA substantial part of our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs production is located in the Wattenberg Field, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing formations.\nAlthough we have significant non-producing leasehold positions in the Delaware Basin in Texas and the Utica Shale in Ohio, our current production is primarily located in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. Because our production is not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs produced from the wells in the area;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as the flooding that occurred in Northern Colorado in September 2013;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental regulations; and\n\u2022\ncurtailment of production or interruption in the availability of gathering, processing, or transportation infrastructure and services, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells.\nFor example, bottlenecks in processing and transportation that have occurred in some recent periods in the Wattenberg Field have negatively affected our results of operations, and these adverse effects may be disproportionately severe to us compared to our more geographically diverse competitors. Similarly, the concentration of our producing assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules that could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in areas where exploration and production activities are increasing, as has been the case in recent years in the Wattenberg Field and the Delaware Basin, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and oilfield services increase. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital forecast, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions, which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business.\nCertain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions, including city ordinances, which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business. Such restrictions could affect, among other things, our access to and the permissible uses of our facilities as well as the manner in which we produce oil and natural gas and may restrict or prohibit drilling in general. The costs we incur to comply with such restrictions may be significant in nature, and we may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. Leases in the Utica Shale area are particularly vulnerable to title deficiencies due the long history of land ownership in the area and correspondingly extensive and complex chains of title. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our production and reserves, and ultimately our profitability.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with bank borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operations and proceeds from capital markets transactions and the sale of properties. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures utilizing similar financing sources. Our cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022\nthe costs to produce crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties or for any other reason, our need for capital from other sources could increase, and there can be no assurance that such other sources of capital would be available at that time on reasonable terms or at all. If we raise funds by issuing additional equity securities, this would have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. If we raise funds through the incurrence of debt, the risks we face with respect to our indebtedness would increase and we would incur additional interest expense. Our inability to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms would adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). In addition, both eastern Colorado and western Texas have relatively arid climates and experience drought conditions from time to time. As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may become limited.\nThe imposition of new environmental initiatives relating to wastewater could restrict our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing. This includes potential restrictions on waste disposal, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of hydrocarbons. For example, in 2010 a petition was filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council with the EPA requesting that the agency reassess its prior and long-standing determination that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes would not be regulated as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of the RCRA. The EPA has not yet acted on the petition and it remains pending. In a separate but related matter, a proposed consent decree filed in December 2016 between the EPA and several environmental groups commits the EPA to decide whether to revise its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations and state plan guidelines for the oil and natural gas sector by March 2019. If the EPA began treating some or all of these wastes as \u201chazardous\u201d\nunder Subtitle C in response to the petition or as a result of the proposed consent decree, the consequences for our operations would be serious, and would include a significant increase in costs associated with waste treatment and disposal and a potential inability to conduct operations in some instances.\nThe CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge fill and pollutants into regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands. Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters of the United States has complicated, and will continue to complicate and increase the cost of, obtaining such permits or other approvals. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule that clarifies the scope of the agencies\u2019 jurisdiction under section 404 of the CWA to regulate certain activities occurring in waters of the United States. This rule, known as the Clean Water Rule, has been challenged by various parties in multiple federal courts, and as a result of this litigation is currently stayed and not yet effective. An expansive definition of such jurisdictional waters could affect our ability to operate in certain areas, increase costs of operations, and cause significant scrutiny and delays in permitting. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. These permits, in turn, impose far-ranging monitoring, flow control, and other obligations that have generated, and will continue to generate, increased costs for our operations.\nIn June 2016, the EPA finalized pretreatment standards for indirect discharges of wastewater from the oil and gas extraction industry. The regulation prohibits sending wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. Some states, including Pennsylvania, have banned the treatment of fracturing wastewater at publicly owned treatment facilities. There also has been recent nationwide concern, particularly in Ohio and Oklahoma, over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. As seen in Ohio, it is likely that new rules and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others.\nFinally, the EPA study on hydraulic fracturing noted above focused on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It is possible that the EPA will move to more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our business, financial condition, and operations. In addition, an inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion operations may adversely impact our business.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities the capacity and operation of which we do not control. Market conditions or operational impediments, including high line pressures, particularly in the Wattenberg Field, and other impediments affecting midstream facilities and services, could hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas, and NGL markets, increase our costs or delay production, and thereby adversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. If adequate midstream facilities and services are not available to us on a timely basis and at acceptable costs, our production and results of operations will be adversely affected. For example, in some recent periods, due to ongoing drilling activities by us and third parties and hot temperatures during the summer months, the principal third-party provider we use in the Wattenberg Field area for midstream facilities and services experienced increased gathering system pressures during those warmer months. The resulting capacity constraints reduced the productivity of some of our older vertical wells and limited incremental production from some of our newer horizontal wells. This constrained our production and reduced our revenue from the affected wells. Capacity constraints affecting natural gas production also impacted the associated NGLs. Some operators in the Delaware Basin have experienced similar issues from time to time, in part due to significant increases in production in the area. Our operations in Texas and elsewhere may be adversely affected by those issues. The use of alternative forms of transportation for oil production such as trucks or rail involve risks, including the risk that increased regulation could lead to increased costs or shortages of trucks or railcars.\nIn addition to causing production curtailments, capacity constraints can also reduce the price we receive for the crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs we produce.\nWe rely on third parties to continue to construct additional midstream facilities and related infrastructure to accommodate our growth, and the ability and willingness of those parties to do so is subject to a variety of risks. For example:\n\u2022\nDecreases in commodity prices in recent years have resulted in reduced investment in midstream facilities by some third parties;\n\u2022\nVarious interest groups have protested the construction of new pipelines, and particularly pipelines near water bodies, in various places throughout the country, and protests have at times physically interrupted pipeline construction activities; and\n\u2022\nSome upstream energy companies have in the recent past sought to reject volume commitment agreements with midstream providers in bankruptcy proceedings, and the risk that such efforts will succeed, or that upstream energy company counterparties will otherwise be unable or unwilling to satisfy their volume commitments, may have the effect of reducing investment in midstream infrastructure.\nLike other producers we from time to time enter into volume commitments with midstream providers in order to induce them to provide increased capacity. If we reduce the pace of our drilling activities significantly after entering into such commitments for any reason, it may be difficult or impossible for us to satisfy those commitments.\nReduced commodity prices could result in significant impairment charges and significant downward revisions of proved reserves.\nCrude oil prices fell dramatically in the second half of 2014, with further declines in 2015 and into 2016, and the domestic natural gas market remains weak. Low commodity prices could result in, among other adverse effects, significant impairment charges. The cash flow model we use to assess properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management\u2019s estimates of future oil and gas production and commodity prices, market outlook on forward commodity prices and operating and development costs. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date that the estimate of future cash flows for each producing basin is calculated. However, a significant decrease in long-term forward prices alone could result in a significant impairment for our properties that are sensitive to declines in prices. We have incurred impairment charges in a number of recent periods, including charges of $150.3 million and $158.3 million relating to our Utica Shale properties in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Similar charges could occur in the future. In addition, low commodity prices could result in significant downward revisions to the estimated quantity and value of our proved reserves.\nOur estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nCalculating reserves for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs requires subjective estimates of remaining volumes of underground accumulations of hydrocarbons. Assumptions are also made concerning commodity prices, production levels, and operating and development costs over the economic life of the properties. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be inaccurate. Independent petroleum engineers prepare our estimates of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs reserves using pricing, production, cost, tax and other information that we provide. The reserve estimates are based on certain assumptions regarding commodity prices, production levels, and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual results could greatly affect:\n\u2022\nthe economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties;\n\u2022\nfuture depreciation, depletion, and amortization (\u201cDD&A\u201d) rates and amounts;\n\u2022\nimpairments in the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery;\n\u2022\nestimates of future net cash flows;\n\u2022\ntiming of our capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of funds available for us to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nSome of our reserve estimates must be made with limited production histories, which renders these reserve estimates less reliable than estimates based on longer production histories. Horizontal drilling in the Wattenberg Field is a relatively recent development, whereas vertical drilling has been used by producers in this field for over 40 years. As a result, the amount of production data from horizontal wells available to reserve engineers is relatively small, and future reserve estimates will be affected by additional production data as it becomes available. Horizontal drilling in the Utica Shale and the Delaware Basin has an even more limited history. Further, reserve estimates are based on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that are anticipated to be economically recoverable from a given date forward based on economic conditions that exist at that date. The actual quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs recovered will be different than the reserve estimates since they will not be produced under the same economic conditions as used for the reserve calculations. In addition, quantities of probable and possible reserves by definition are inherently more risky than proved reserves, in part because they have greater uncertainty associated with the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 71.2 percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves, including approximately $2.1 billion during the five years ending December 31, 2021, as estimated in the calculation of the standardized measure of oil and gas activity. The estimated development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules, PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of initial booking, and we may therefore be required to downgrade to probable or possible any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nThe present value of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of those reserves. Pursuant to SEC rules, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves, and the estimated quantity of those reserves, were based on the prior year\u2019s first day of the month 12-month average crude oil and natural gas index prices. However, factors such as actual prices we receive for crude oil and natural gas and hedging instruments, the amount and timing of actual production, the amount and timing of future development costs, the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and changes in governmental regulations or taxation, also affect our actual future net cash flows from our properties. The timing of both our production and incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor (the rate required by the SEC) we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates currently in effect and risks associated with our properties or the industry in general.\nUnless reserves are replaced as they are produced, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to develop our identified drilling locations as planned.\nProducing crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. The rate of decline may change over time and may exceed our estimates. Our future reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our ability to efficiently develop and exploit our current reserves and to economically find or acquire additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, discover, or acquire additional\nreserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our future operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified a number of well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ncrude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\ndrilling and production costs;\n\u2022\navailability of drilling services and equipment;\n\u2022\ndrilling results;\n\u2022\nlease expirations;\n\u2022\nmidstream constraints;\n\u2022\naccess to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nother factors.\nBecause of these factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs from these or any other potential well locations. In addition, the number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. Further, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties. Some states, including Colorado, allow the involuntary pooling of tracts in a relatively broad number of circumstances in order to facilitate exploration. Other states, including Texas, restrict involuntary pooling to a narrower set of circumstances and consequently these states rely primarily on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In states where pooling is accomplished primarily on a voluntary basis, it may be more difficult to form units and, therefore, more difficult to fully develop a project if we own less than 100 percent of the leasehold or one or more of our leases does not provide the necessary pooling authority. If third parties are unwilling to pool their interests with ours, we may be unable to require such pooling on a timely basis or at all, and this would limit the total locations we can drill. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. Further, our inventory of drilling projects includes locations in addition to those that we currently classify as proved, probable, and possible. The development of and results from these additional projects are more uncertain than those relating to probable and possible locations, and significantly more uncertain than those relating to proved locations. We have generally accelerated the pace of our development activities in the Wattenberg Field over the past several years, and this has reduced our related inventory of drilling locations.\nThe wells we drill may not yield crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs in commercially viable quantities and productive wells may be less successful than we expect.\nA prospect is a property on which our geologists have identified what they believe, based on available information, to be indications of hydrocarbon-bearing rocks. However, our geologists cannot know conclusively prior to drilling and testing whether crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs will be present in sufficient quantities to repay drilling or completion costs and generate a profit given the available data and technology. Furthermore, even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques do not enable our geologists to be certain as to whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures or the quantity of the hydrocarbons. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur greater drilling and testing expenses as a result of such expenditures, which may result in a reduction in our returns or losses. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline. If a well is determined to be dry or uneconomic, which can occur even though it contains some crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs, it is classified as a dry hole and must be plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable regulations. This generally results in the loss of the entire cost of drilling and completion to that point, the cost of plugging, and lease costs associated with the prospect. Even wells that are completed and placed into production may not produce sufficient crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to be profitable, or they may be less productive and/or profitable than we expected. In recent years we have been able to achieve reductions in drilling and completion costs in connection with lower commodity prices. However, as commodity prices have stabilized or increased since mid-2016, many of these costs have begun to increase, and further increases are expected. If we drill a dry hole or unprofitable well on a current or future prospect, or if drilling or completion costs increase, the profitability of our operations will decline and the value of our properties will likely be reduced. Exploratory drilling is typically subject to substantially greater risk than development drilling. In addition, initial results from a well are not necessarily indicative of its performance over a longer period.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling can be unprofitable, not only due to dry holes, but also due to curtailments, delays, or cancellations as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\npressures;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nfloods;\n\u2022\nloss of well control;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services;\n\u2022\nunanticipated environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells, and regulatory penalties. For example, a loss of containment of hydrocarbons during drilling activities could potentially subject us to civil and/or criminal liability and the possibility of substantial costs, including for environmental remediation, depending upon the circumstances of the loss of containment, the nature and scope of the loss and the applicable laws and regulations. We maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from our operations; however, insurance against certain operational risks may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risks presented. For example, we may not have coverage with respect to a pollution event if we are unaware of the event while it is occurring and are therefore unable to report the occurrence of the event to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. Thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or for amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance and/or governmental or third party responses to an event could have a material adverse effect on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently involved in various remedial and investigatory activities at some of our wells and related sites.\nOur business strategy focuses on production in our liquid-rich shale plays. In this regard, we plan to allocate our capital to an active horizontal drilling program. Prior to 2012, most of the wells we drilled were vertical wells. Since 2012, however, we have devoted the majority of our capital budget to drilling horizontal wells. Drilling horizontal wells is technologically more difficult than drilling vertical wells - including as a result of risks relating to our ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages and to successfully run casing the length of the well bore - and the risk of failure is therefore greater than the risk involved in drilling vertical wells. Additionally, drilling a horizontal well is typically far costlier than drilling a vertical well. This means that the risks of our drilling program will be spread over a smaller number of wells, and that, in order to be economic, each horizontal well will need to produce at a higher level in order to cover the higher drilling costs. Similarly, the average lateral length of the horizontal wells we drill has generally been increasing. Longer-lateral wells are typically more expensive and require more time for preparation and permitting. In addition, we have transitioned to the use of multi-well pads instead of single-well sites. The use of multi-well pad drilling increases some operational risks because problems affecting the pad or a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad. Pad drilling can also make our overall production, and therefore our revenue and cash flows, more volatile, because production from multiple wells on a pad will typically commence simultaneously. While we believe that we will be better served by drilling horizontal wells using multi-well pads, the risk component involved in such drilling will be increased in some respects, with the result that we might find it more difficult to achieve economic success in our drilling program.\nUnder the \u201csuccessful efforts\u201d accounting method that we use, unsuccessful exploratory wells must be expensed in the period when they are determined to be non-productive, which reduces our net income in such periods and could have a negative effect on our profitability.\nWe conduct exploratory drilling in order to identify additional opportunities for future development. Under the \u201csuccessful efforts\u201d method of accounting that we use, the cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells must be charged to expense in the period in which the wells are determined to be unsuccessful. In addition, lease costs for acreage condemned by the unsuccessful well must also be expensed. In contrast, unsuccessful development wells are capitalized as a part of the investment in the field where they are located. Because exploratory wells generally are more likely to be unsuccessful than development wells, we anticipate that some or all of our exploratory wells may not be productive. The costs of such unsuccessful exploratory wells could result in a significant reduction in our profitability in periods when the costs are required to be expensed.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and the cost of servicing, and risks related to refinancing, that debt could adversely affect our business. Those risks could increase if we incur more debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As a result, a significant portion of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowing capacity available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. We incurred a substantial amount of additional debt in order\nto finance part of the purchase price for the Delaware Basin acquisitions, and the properties acquired currently produce only modest amounts of cash flow from operations.\nServicing our indebtedness and satisfying our other obligations will require a significant amount of cash. Our cash flows from operating activities and other sources may not be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend on our future operating performance and financial condition and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, including possibly depressed commodity pricing, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We expect that some commercial lenders may look to reduce their exposure to exploration and production companies due to regulatory pressures they face and/or independent business considerations. This could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to refinance our debt.\nA substantial decrease in our operating cash flows or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations, including by curtailing our exploration and drilling programs, selling assets, refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt, or obtaining additional financing. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements may, and our existing debt agreements do, restrict us from implementing some of these alternatives. In the absence of adequate cash from operations and other available capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate these dispositions for fair market value, in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service or other obligations then due. Because the cash required to service our indebtedness is not available to finance our operations and other business activities, our indebtedness limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and sustained declines in commodity prices.\nCovenants in our debt agreements currently impose, and future financing agreements may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes and our revolving credit facility contain restrictions, and future financing agreements may contain additional restrictions, on our activities, including covenants that restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem, or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments;\n\u2022\napply net proceeds from certain asset sales;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u2022\nrestrict dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell equity interests of restricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nsell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or dispose of assets.\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our crude oil and natural gas properties as well as a pledge of all ownership interests in our operating subsidiaries. The restrictions contained in our debt agreements may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nOur revolving credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants and our ability to comply with those restrictions and covenants is uncertain. Our lenders can unilaterally reduce our borrowing availability based on anticipated commodity prices.\nWe depend in large part on our revolving credit facility for future capital needs. The terms of the credit agreement require us to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the revolving credit facility or other debt agreements could result in a default under those agreements, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable.\nThe revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount, determined by the lenders in their sole discretion based upon projected revenues from the properties securing their loan. Decreases in the price of crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs can be expected to have an adverse effect on the borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately, or we must pledge other crude oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the revolving credit facility. Our inability to borrow additional funds under our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, there would be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed and would impact our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our revolving credit facility that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows and are otherwise unable to obtain the funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, the default could result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the required lenders under our revolving credit facility to avoid being in default and we may not be able to obtain such a waiver. If this occurs, we would be in default under our revolving credit facility, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to our debt agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase although the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness and for other purposes would decrease.\nNotwithstanding our current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur substantial additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe may be able to incur additional debt in the future. Although our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. In particular, we may borrow under the revolving credit facility, and may do so in 2017. We may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions that may increase our indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levels could intensify the related risks that we now face.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can adversely affect our operations.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife affect operations in some areas. In certain areas drilling and other activities may be restricted or prohibited by lease stipulations, or prevented by weather conditions, for significant periods of time. This limits our operations in those areas and can intensify competition during the active months for drilling rigs, oil field equipment, services, supplies, and qualified personnel, which may lead to additional or increased costs or periodic shortages. These constraints and the resulting high costs or shortages could delay our operations and materially increase operating and capital costs and therefore adversely affect our profitability. Similarly, hot weather during some recent periods adversely impacted the operation of certain midstream facilities, and therefore our production. Similar events could occur in the future and could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties in which we own an interest but we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues.\nWe operate approximately 88 percent of the wells in which we own an interest. If we do not operate the properties in which we own an interest, we do not have control over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of the underlying properties. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s timing and amount of capital expenditures, expertise (including safety and environmental compliance) and financial resources, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells, and use of technology. The failure by an operator to adequately perform operations, or an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements, could reduce production and revenues and adversely affect our profitability. These risks are heightened in some respects in periods of depressed commodity prices as operators may propose operations that we believe to be economically unattractive, leading us to incur non-consent penalties. Our lack of control over non-operated properties also makes it more difficult for us to forecast capital expenditures, production and related matters.\nOur commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduced income from failure to perform by our counterparties, could limit our potential gains from increases in prices and could result in volatility in our net income.\nWe use commodity derivatives for a portion of the production from our own wells and for natural gas purchases and sales by our marketing subsidiary to achieve more predictable cash flows, to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, and to allow our natural gas marketing company to offer pricing options to natural gas sellers and purchasers. These arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when purchases or sales are different than expected or the counterparty to the commodity derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, many of our commodity derivative contracts are based on WTI or another oil or natural gas index price. The risk that the differential between the index price and the price we receive for the relevant production may change unexpectedly makes it more difficult to hedge effectively and increases the risk of a hedging-related loss.\nAlso, commodity derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for the relevant commodity, and they may require the use of our resources to meet cash margin requirements.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2016, we had hedged a total of 13,342 MBbls of crude oil and 128,036 BBtu of natural gas for 2017 and 2018. These hedges may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in oil and natural gas prices, and our current hedge position is smaller than it has been in recent years.\nThe estimated fair value of our aggregate commodity derivative position as of December 31, 2015, was an asset balance of approximately $263.8 million. As a result of factors including the settlement of commodity derivative positions over the course of 2016 and changes in commodity prices, the estimated fair value of our aggregate commodity derivative position as of December 31, 2016 was a liability balance of approximately $70.0 million. Accordingly, based on our current commodity derivative positions and current commodity prices, we expect that cash flow from our commodity derivative activities will be substantially lower in 2017 than it was in 2016, and may be negative.\nSince we do not designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges, we do not currently qualify for use of hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives are recorded in our income statements, and our net income is subject to greater volatility than it would be if our commodity derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting. For instance, if commodity prices rise significantly, this could result in significant non-cash charges during the relevant period, which could have a material negative effect on our net income.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers or other counterparties to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales or joint interest billings to a small number of third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may affect our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. In addition, our commodity derivatives as well as the commodity derivatives used by our marketing subsidiary expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Nonperformance by our customers or derivative counterparties may adversely affect our financial condition and profitability. We face similar risks with respect to our other counterparties, including the lenders under our revolving credit facility and the providers of our insurance coverage.\nWe participate in oil and gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe frequently own less than 100 percent of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties will own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil, natural gas, and NGL prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some liabilities or losses that we may incur.\nThe occurrence of a significant accident or other event not fully covered by insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance at levels that would provide enough funds for us to continue operating without access to other funds. We also do not carry contingent business interruption insurance related to the purchasers of our production. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement those or other new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we were unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nOur industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, larger companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low commodity prices. Larger competitors may also be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local, and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These factors could adversely affect the success of our operations and our profitability.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nA failure to complete successful acquisitions would limit our growth.\nBecause our crude oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets, our future reserves, production volumes, and cash flows depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. In addition, we continue to strive to achieve greater efficiencies in our drilling program, and our ability to do so is dependent in part on our ability to complete land trades or exchanges and other acquisitions that allow us to increase our working interests in particular properties. Acquiring additional crude oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise is a significant component of our strategy. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. It may be difficult to agree on the economic terms of a transaction, as a potential seller may be unwilling to accept a price that we believe to be appropriately reflective of prevailing economic conditions. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be more difficult to replace our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions of properties are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities, including environmental uncertainties.\nAcquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped properties have been an important part of our growth over time. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves, development potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, title issues, and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we generally perform engineering, environmental, geological, and geophysical reviews of the acquired properties, which we believe are generally consistent with industry practices. However, such reviews are not likely to permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well prior to an acquisition and our ability to evaluate undeveloped acreage is inherently imprecise. Even when we inspect a well, we may not always discover structural, subsurface, and environmental problems that may exist or arise. In some cases, our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited. In addition, we often acquire acreage without any warranty of title except as to claims made by, through or under the transferor.\nWhen we acquire properties, we will generally have potential exposure to liabilities and costs for environmental and other problems existing on the acquired properties, and these liabilities may exceed our estimates. Often we are not entitled to contractual indemnification associated with acquired properties. We often acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with no or limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. Therefore, we could incur significant unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, or losses due to title defects, in connection with acquisitions for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage. In addition, the acquisition of undeveloped acreage is subject to many inherent risks and we may not be able to realize efficiently, or at all, the assumed or expected economic benefits of acreage that we acquire.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or may be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. These factors can increase the risks associated with an acquisition. Acquisitions also present risks associated with the additional indebtedness that may be required to finance the purchase price, and any related increase in interest expense or other related charges.\nSome of our acquisitions are structured as land trades or exchanges. These transactions may give rise to any or all of the foregoing risks. In addition, transactions of this type create a risk that we will undervalue the properties we transfer to the counterparty in the trade or exchange. Such an undervaluation would result in the transaction being less favorable to us than we expected.\nThe cost of defending any suits brought against us, and any judgments or settlements resulting from such suits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike many oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters, and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. For example, in recent years, we have been subject to lawsuits regarding royalty practices and payments and matters relating to certain of our affiliated partnerships. In addition in August 2015 we received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request (the \"Information Request\")from the EPA, and this request could result in penalties or other liabilities. The outcome of pending legal proceedings is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, the resolution of such a proceeding could result in penalties or sanctions, settlement costs and/or judgments, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties, sanctions or costs may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or the anticipated range of potential losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Adverse events could trigger declines in the price of our common stock, including, among others:\n\u2022\nchanges in production volumes, worldwide demand and prices for crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nchanges in market prices of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ninability to hedge future production at the same pricing level as our current hedges;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes, particularly among securities of energy companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations and valuation multiples of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding adverse timing or lack of success in discovering, acquiring, developing, and producing crude oil and natural gas resources;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new acquisitions, discoveries, commercial relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the amount of capital available to us, including as a result of borrowing base reductions and/or lenders ceasing to participate in our revolving credit facility syndicate;\n\u2022\noperating results that fall below market expectations or variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer;\n\u2022\nloss of a relationship with a partner;\n\u2022\nthe identification of and severity of environmental events and governmental and other third-party responses to the events; or\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nExternal events, such as news concerning economic conditions, counterparties to our natural gas or oil derivatives arrangements, changes in government regulations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industries or the movement of capital into or out of our industry, are also likely to affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Similarly, our stock price could be adversely affected by changes in the way that analysts and investors assess the geological and economic characteristics of the basins in which we operate. For example, general market perceptions of the Permian Basin region have recently become highly favorable, and adverse changes in those perceptions could have a corresponding effect on the price of our stock. Furthermore, general market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations in, the trading prices of stocks generally could affect the price of our common stock. Recently, the stock markets have experienced price and volume volatility that has affected many companies\u2019 stock prices. Stock prices for many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These fluctuations may affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, a portion of the consideration we paid to the sellers in the Delaware Basin acquisitions was in the form our common stock. Those shares are currently subject to lock-up periods set forth in the applicable Investment Agreement. Upon the expiration of the lock-up period, the sellers will be entitled to sell their shares into the public markets, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to them will be sufficient in preventing them from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn particular, the oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling activities, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and to process and record financial and operating data.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to store, transmit, process, and record sensitive information (including trade secrets, employee information, and financial and operating data), communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. The complexity of the technologies needed to explore for and develop oil, natural gas, and NGLs make certain information more attractive to thieves.\nOur business partners, including vendors, service providers, operating partners, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. Some of these business partners may be provided limited access to our sensitive information or our information systems and related infrastructure. A vulnerability in the cybersecurity of one or more of our vendors could facilitate an attack on our systems.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. \u201cPhishing\u201d and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized\ninformation or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat. Certain countries are believed to possess cyber warfare capabilities and are credited with attacks on American companies and government agencies.\nOur technologies, systems and networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, theft of property or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Given the politically sensitive nature of hydraulic fracturing and the controversy generated by its opponents, our technologies, systems and networks may be of particular interest to certain groups with political agendas, which may seek to launch cyber-attacks as a method of promoting their message. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations. Although to date we have not experienced any significant cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of such attacks in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we produce while physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such GHGs are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings provide the basis for the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. In June 2010, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from stationary sources under the CAA\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V permitting programs. It was widely expected that facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions would be required to also reduce those emissions according to \u201cbest available control technology\u201d (\u201cBACT\u201d) standards. In its permitting guidance for GHGs, issued in November 2010, the EPA recommended options for BACT from the largest sources, which include improved energy efficiency, among others. The EPA also issued a final rule in July 2013 retaining the \u201ctailored\u201d permitting thresholds, opting not to extend GHG permitting requirements to smaller stationary sources at that time.\nIn June 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion and order in Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. Environmental Protection Agency, upholding the EPA\u2019s GHG-related rules against challenges from various state and industry group petitioners. In October 2013, the United States Supreme Court in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, accepted a petition for certiorari to decide whether the EPA correctly determined that its regulation of GHGs from mobile sources triggered permitting requirements under the CAA for stationary sources that emit GHGs. In June 2014, the Supreme Court upheld a portion of the EPA\u2019s GHG stationary source program, but invalidated a portion of it. The Court held that stationary sources already subject to the PSD or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG BACT requirements, but ruled that sources subject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with GHG BACT requirements. Upon remand, the D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment, which, among other things, vacated the PSD and Title V regulations under review in that case to the extent they require a stationary source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit GHGs above the applicable major source thresholds. In October 2016, the EPA issued a proposed rule to revise its PSD and Title V regulations applicable to GHGs in accordance with the decisions noted above, including proposing a de minimis level of GHG emissions below which BACT is not required. Depending on what the EPA does in a final rule, it is possible that any regulatory or permitting obligation that limits emissions of GHGs could extend to smaller stationary sources and require us to incur costs to reduce and monitor emissions of GHGs associated with our operations and also adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nIn the past, Congress has considered various pieces of legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. Congress has not adopted any significant legislation in this respect to date, but could do so in the future. If Congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such measures could include a carbon tax, which could result in additional direct costs to our operations. In the absence of such national legislation, many states and regions have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. For example, in February 2014, Colorado adopted rules directly regulating methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.\nPresident Obama indicated that climate change and GHG regulation was a significant priority for his second term. The President issued a Climate Action Plan in June 2013 that, among other things, calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. In November 2013, the President released an Executive Order charging various federal agencies, including the EPA, with devising and pursuing strategies to improve the country\u2019s preparedness and resilience to climate change. In part through these executive actions, the direct regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector continues to be a focus as reflected in both the EPA\u2019s OOOOa and BLM\u2019s venting and flaring regulations both finalized in 2016 as noted above. In addition, a lawsuit has been filed by several northeastern states that would require the EPA to more stringently regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Finally, the Obama administration reached an agreement during the December 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris pursuant to which the United States initially pledged to make a 26-28 percent reduction in its GHG emissions by 2025 against a 2005 baseline and committed to periodically update this pledge every five years starting in 2020. The passage of legislation or executive and other initiatives, including those made to implement the pledges made in Paris, that limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce GHG emissions, and it could also adversely affect demand for the crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we produce.\nSome have suggested that one consequence of climate change could be increased severity of extreme weather, such as increased hurricanes and floods. Flooding that occurred in Colorado in 2013 is an example of an extreme weather event that negatively impacted our\noperations. If such events were to continue to occur, or become more frequent, our operations could be adversely affected in various ways, including through damage to our facilities or from increased costs for insurance.\nAnother possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. The market for natural gas is generally improved by periods of colder weather and impaired by periods of warmer weather, so any changes in climate could affect the market for the fuels that we produce. Despite the use of the term \u201cglobal warming\u201d as a shorthand for climate change, some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. As a result, it is difficult to predict how the market for our fuels could be affected by increased temperature volatility, although if there is an overall trend of warmer temperatures, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs, additional drilling and operating restrictions or delays in the production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and could prohibit hydraulic fracturing activities.\nSubstantially all of our drilling uses hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional wells in shale, coalbed, and tight sand formations. Proposals have been introduced in the U.S. Congress to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations and related injection of fracturing fluids and propping agents used by the crude oil and natural gas industry in fracturing fluids under the SDWA, and to require the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process under the SDWA, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (\u201cEPCRA\u201d), or other laws. Sponsors of these bills, which have been subject to various proceedings in the legislative process, including in the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies and otherwise cause adverse environmental impacts. In March 2011, the EPA announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. In June 2015, the EPA released a draft assessment of the potential impacts to drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing for public comment and peer review. The assessment concluded that while there are mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water resources, there was no evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. The EPA\u2019s science advisory board subsequently questioned several elements and conclusions in the EPA\u2019s draft assessment. In December 2016, the EPA released the final report on impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identified some factors that could influence these impacts. In addition, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices.\nThe EPA has begun a Toxic Substances Control Act rulemaking which will collect expansive information on the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluid, as well as other health-related data, from chemical manufacturers and processors. The EPA has not indicated when it intends to issue a proposed rule, but it issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2014, seeking public comment on a variety of issues related to the rulemaking. In October 2015, the EPA also granted, in part, a petition filed by several national environmental advocacy groups to add the oil and gas extraction industry to the list of industries required to report releases of certain \u201ctoxic chemicals\u201d under the Toxics Release Inventory (\u201cTRI\u201d) program under EPCRA. The EPA determined that natural gas processing facilities may be appropriate for addition to the scope of TRI and will conduct a rulemaking process to propose such action. On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the TRI program.\nThe EPA also finalized major new CAA standards (New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) applicable to hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and certain storage vessels in August 2012. The standards require, among other things, use of reduced emission completions, or green completions, to reduce volatile organic compound emissions during well completions as well as new controls applicable to a wide variety of storage tanks and other equipment, including compressors, controllers, and dehydrators. Following administrative reconsideration of a portion of the 2012 rules, the EPA issued one set of final amendments to the rule in September 2013 related to storage tanks, and a second set of final amendments largely related to reduced emissions completion requirements in December 2014. Most key provisions in the new CAA standards became effective in 2015.\nIn January 2015, President Obama announced a comprehensive strategy to further reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. As part of this strategy, in June 2016, the EPA finalized amendments to the 2012 NSPS Quad OOOO rules as well as new requirements focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from the oil and natural gas industry. Known as NSPS OOOOa, the new rules impose, among other things, new requirements for leak detection and repair, control requirements at oil well completions, replacement of certain pneumatic pumps and controllers, and additional control requirements for gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. These additional methane reduction requirements are substantial and could increase future costs of our operations and require us to make modifications to our operations and install new equipment. In December 2016, the EPA began a process to regulate existing oil and natural gas facilities through a nationwide Information Collection Request (ICR). The ICR has two parts. First, the EPA is requesting general information about equipment at existing facilities from every operator throughout the country. Second, the EPA issued ICRs to a more targeted set of facilities, requesting more detailed information about these operations. During the fall of 2016, the EPA also issued final Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs) for reducing volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and natural gas equipment and processes in ozone non-attainment areas, including the Denver Front Range 8-hour ozone non-attainment area. The ICR and CTG processes could culminate in additional controls being required for our existing sources, which may increase the future costs of operations and require modifications or the installation of new equipment.\nOn the same day the EPA finalized the NSPS OOOOa rules, it also finalized a rule regarding source determination and permitting requirements for the onshore oil and gas industry under the CAA. The final rule defines the term \u201cadjacent,\u201d which is one of three factors used to determine whether stationary sources (including oil and gas equipment and activities) are considered part of a source that is subject to major source permitting requirements under the CAA. Under this final rule, the oil and gas industry and our operations could be subject to increased permitting costs and more stringent control requirements.\nThe EPA has also issued permitting guidance under the SDWA for the underground injection of liquids from hydraulically fractured (and other) wells where diesel is used. Depending upon how it is implemented, this guidance may create duplicative requirements in certain areas, further slow the permitting process in certain areas, increase the costs of operations, and result in expanded regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities by the EPA and may therefore adversely affect even companies, such as PDC, that do not use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing activities.\nCertain other federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. Most notably, in 2015 the U.S. Department of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management (the \u201cBLM\u201d), finalized regulations regarding chemical disclosure requirements and other regulations specific to well stimulation activities, including hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands. Due to pending litigation, however, the effective date of the rule has been postponed. In November 2016, BLM finalized rules to further regulate venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. The rules require additional controls and impose new emissions and other standards on certain operations on applicable leases, including committed state or private tracts in a federally approved unit or communitized agreement that drain federal minerals. In October 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) proposed to expand its regulations in a number of ways, including increased regulation of gathering lines, even in rural areas, and proposed additional standards to revise safety regulations applicable to onshore gas transmission and gathering pipelines in 2016. In May 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation also issued a final rule regarding the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail. The final rule imposes certain requirements on \u201cofferors\u201d of crude oil, including sampling, testing, and certification requirements.\nIn addition, the governments of certain states, including Colorado, Texas, and Ohio, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that impose or could impose, among other requirements, stringent permitting or air emission control requirements, disclosure, wastewater disposal, baseline sampling, seismic monitoring, well construction and well location requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, more stringent notification or consultation processes, or otherwise seek to ban underground injection of fracturing wastewater or fracturing activities altogether. For example, in January 2012, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (\u201cODNR\u201d) issued a temporary moratorium on the development of hydraulic fracturing disposal wells in northeast Ohio in order to study the relationship between these wells and earthquakes reported in the area. As a result, ODNR promulgated new and more stringent regulations for certain underground injection wells, including requirements for a complete suite of geophysical logs, analytical interpretation of the logs, and enhanced monitoring and recording. More recently, in April 2014, ODNR shut down a number of well sites after a series of small earthquakes in northeast Ohio. After investigating the earthquakes and determining that the connection to hydraulic fracturing was \u201cprobable,\u201d ODNR implemented new permit conditions, requiring that operators of well sites within three miles of a known fault must install sensitive seismic-monitoring equipment. Operators must also halt drilling if a seismic event exceeds 1.0 magnitude. In January 2014, the Railroad Commission of Texas finalized a \u201cwell integrity rule,\u201d which updates the requirements for drilling and cementing wells, and includes new testing and reporting requirements. In October 2014, the Railroad Commission published a new rule governing the permitting of disposal wells that requires the submission of detailed information related to seismicity. This rule grants the Railroad Commission the ability to deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit. Similar initiatives could spread to other states in which we operate. In addition, oil and gas producers may be subject to lawsuits brought by landowners for earthquake-related damages.\nAt the local level, some municipalities and local governments have adopted or are considering bans on hydraulic fracturing. Beginning in 2012, voters in the cities of Fort Collins, Boulder, Longmont, Broomfield and Lafayette, Colorado approved bans of varying length on hydraulic fracturing within their respective city limits. In 2014, Boulder and Larimer county lower courts overturned the bans. The cities of Longmont and Fort Collins appealed the decisions. In August 2015, the Court of Appeals requested that the Colorado Supreme Court rule on the issue. The Colorado Supreme Court struck down the Fort Collins and Longmont bans in May 2016. Nonetheless, extended moratoria, like that put in place by Boulder County in December 2016, remain a threat to oil and gas operations in Colorado.\nIn Texas, voters in the City of Denton approved a local ordinance banning hydraulic fracturing in November 2014. In May 2015, the Texas legislature responded by enacting a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and gas activities.\nIn Ohio, several municipalities have passed hydraulic fracturing bans. In February 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that local governments cannot regulate hydraulic fracturing, finding that the State of Ohio has exclusive authority over regulating this activity under the State\u2019s oil and gas preemption law, passed in 2004. In light of the recent Ohio Supreme Court decision, activists in Ohio are calling for the repeal of the oil and gas preemption law.\nIn addition, lawsuits have been filed against unrelated third parties in several states, including Colorado and Ohio, alleging contamination of drinking water by hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation, regulation, litigation, or moratoria could also lead to operational delays or lead us to incur increased operating or capital costs in the production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing or other drilling activities. If these legislative, regulatory, litigation, and other initiatives cause a material decrease in the drilling of new wells or an increase in drilling costs, our profitability could be materially impacted.\nEnvironmental and overall public scrutiny focused on the oil and gas industry is increasing. The current trend is to increase regulation of our operations and the industry. We are subject to complex federal, state, local, and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur exploration, development, production, and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state, and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating, and abandoning crude oil and natural gas wells and associated facilities. Under these laws and regulations, we could also be liable for personal injuries, property damage, and natural resource or other damages. Similar to our competitors, we incur substantial operating and capital costs to comply with such laws and regulations. These compliance costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger\ncompanies in the industry which can more easily capture economies of scale with respect to compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in various sanctions, including the suspension or termination of our operations or other operational impediments, and could subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years-particularly with respect to hydraulic fracturing-and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects. These regulations also affect our operations, increase our costs of exploration and production, and limit the quantity of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce and market.\nA major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the possibility that we will be unable to obtain needed drilling permits from relevant governmental authorities in a timely manner. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well, or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable or unexpected conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore or develop our properties. Additionally, the crude oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that substantially increase our financial and managerial compliance costs, increase our exposure to potential damages or limit our activities.\nThe election of President Trump has resulted in uncertainty with respect to the future regulatory environment affecting the oil and natural gas industry. This uncertainty may affect how our industry is regulated as well as the level of public interest in environmental protection and may result in new or different pressures being exerted. For example, public interest groups may increase their use of litigation as a means to continue to exert pressure on the oil and natural gas industry. Accordingly, while we expect regulatory and enforcement pressures on our business to continue at federal, state, and local levels, the nature, level, and source of such pressures may change.\nIn August 2015, we received the Information Request from the EPA. The Information Request seeks, among other things, information related to the design, operation, and maintenance of our production facilities in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado. The Information Request focuses primarily on 46 of our production facilities and asks that we conduct certain sampling and analyses at the identified 46 facilities. We responded to the Information Request in January 2016. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time. Certain other operators in the area have been assessed penalties following similar information requests.\nIn a related Clean Air Act development, on October 1, 2015, the EPA announced its final rule lowering the existing 75 part per billion (\u201cppb\u201d) NAAQS for ozone under the CAA to 70 ppb. The lower ozone NAAQS could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. In addition, the state of Colorado\u2019s non-attainment status was bumped up from \u201cmarginal\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d for the Denver Metro North Front Range Ozone 8-Hour Non-Attainment area. This increase in non-attainment status triggers significant additional obligations for the State under the CAA. In 2016, the state undertook rulemaking to address the new \u201cmoderate\u201d status, culminating in, among others, the incorporation of two existing state-only requirements for oil and natural gas operations into the federally-enforceable State Implementation Plan (\"SIP\"). In 2017, as part of the federal Control Techniques Guideline (\u201cCTG\u201d) process for oil and natural gas, Colorado will begin a stakeholder and rulemaking effort to compare the CTGs to existing Colorado requirements to ensure they meet applicable federal requirements. This process could result in new or more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations.\nIn addition, our activities are subject to regulations governing conservation practices, protection of wildlife and habitat, and protection of correlative rights by state governments. For example, the federal Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) and analogous state laws restrict activities that may adversely affect endangered and threatened species or their habitat. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or their habitat in areas where we operate could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in May 2014 proposed a rule to alter how that agency designates critical habitat. That rule was finalized in 2016 and, depending on how it is implemented, could expand the reach of the ESA.\nAt the state level the COGCC issued a rule in 2013 governing mandatory minimum setbacks between oil and gas wells and occupied buildings and other areas. Also in 2013, the COGCC issued rules that require baseline sampling of certain ground and surface water in most areas of Colorado and impose stringent spill reporting and remediation requirements. These new sampling requirements could increase the costs of developing wells in certain locations. Other regulatory amendments and policies recently adopted or being proposed by the COGCC address wellbore integrity, hydraulic fracturing, well control, waste management, spill reporting, development of large scale facilities in urban mitigation areas, and certain local government notice requirements. In addition to increasing costs of operation and permitting times, some of these rules and policies, as well as litigation by public interest groups challenging application of these rules or policies, could prevent us from drilling wells on certain locations we plan to develop, thereby reducing our reserves as well as our future revenues.\nIn addition, during 2014, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Act was amended to increase the potential sanctions for violating the Act or its implementing regulations, orders, or permits. These amendments increase the maximum penalty per violation per day from $1,000 to $15,000; eliminate a $10,000 maximum penalty for violations that do not result in significant waste of oil and gas resources, damage to correlative rights, or adverse impact to public health, safety, or welfare; require the COGCC to assess a penalty for each day there is evidence of a violation; and authorize the COGCC to prohibit the issuance of new permits and suspend certificates of clearance for egregious violations resulting from gross negligence or knowing and willful misconduct. In December 2014, the COGCC convened a hearing and adopted proposed amendments to its regulations to implement this new legislation and address certain other issues. Among other things, the amendments create a new process for calculating penalties, new standards for determining days of violation and penalty amounts, new restrictions on the use of informal enforcement procedures, and penalty reductions for voluntary disclosures. Following the adoption of this new penalty scheme, Colorado operators have experienced increased penalties for violations within COGCC\u2019s jurisdiction.\nIn 2015, the COGCC convened hearings on regulations for large facilities located in urban mitigation areas. These new rules require best available technology and include required mitigations for emissions, flaring, fire, fluid leak detection, repair, reporting, automated well shut-in, storage tank pressure control, and proppant dust control. During these hearings, COGCC staff reported there would\nalso be site-specific mitigation requirements for noise, ground and surface water protection, visual impacts, and remote stimulation. After debate, the rule did not include duration limits despite an opinion from the State Attorney General Office that the COGCC possessed authority to impose duration limits under current and existing statutes.\nIn February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s Air Quality Control Commission (\u201cAQCC\u201d) finalized regulations imposing stringent new requirements relating to air emissions from oil and gas facilities in Colorado. The new rules impose significantly more stringent control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements than those required under comparable new federal rules. In addition, as part of the rule, the AQCC approved the direct regulation of hydrocarbon (i.e., methane) emissions from the Colorado oil and gas sector. Such state-only, direct regulation of methane (a greenhouse gas) from a single industry sector affected federal regulations from the EPA and the BLM, and continues to have the potential to adversely affect operations in Colorado as well as in other parts of the country. Along the same lines, local governments are undertaking air quality studies to assess potential public health impacts from oil and gas operations. These studies, in combination with other air quality-related studies that are national in scope, may result in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements on oil and gas operations.\nCERCLA (or the \u201cSuperfund law\u201d) and some comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. This includes potential liability for activities on properties we may currently own or operate upon, but where previous owner/operators caused the release of a hazardous substance. In addition, we may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been or threaten to be released into the environment. From time to time, we are involved in remediation activities at such properties.\nRegulatory focus on worker safety and health regulations involving operating hazards in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities is also increasing. One example is a recent investigation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) and other governmental authorities regarding potential worker exposure to hydrocarbon vapors from certain fuel transfer and related tasks. Several recent worker fatalities at oil and gas facilities nationwide are being reviewed by OSHA and other governmental authorities for a potential link to hydrocarbon vapor exposure. Regulatory requirements generally relating to worker exposure to hydrocarbon vapors could be increased or receive heightened scrutiny going forward. For example, in December 2015, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources Division released a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d), announcing an inter-agency effort to increase the enforcement of workplace safety crimes that occur in conjunction with environmental crimes. Consistent with this MOU, DOJ will look for additional felony violations (such as false statements and willful violations of certain standards) when prosecuting safety crimes in order to heighten prospective penalties and strengthen enforcement. In October 2016, OSHA issued a Regional Emphasis Program (REP) notice for the purpose of conducting safety and hazard inspections at oil and gas industry facilities in Region III (Pennsylvania and West Virginia). Similar notices could result in increased OSHA activities in the areas in which we operate.\nOther potential laws and regulations affecting us include new or increased severance taxes proposed in several states, including Ohio. This could adversely affect our existing operations in the state and the economic viability of future drilling. Additional laws, regulations, or other changes could significantly reduce our future growth, increase our costs of operations, and reduce our cash flows, in addition to undermining the demand for the crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs we produce.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas and exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nPotential legislation, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The changes could include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address these proposals would impact our business, but any such future laws and regulations could result in higher federal income taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, proposals are made from time to time in states where we operate to implement or increase severance or other taxes at the state level, and any such additional taxes would have similarly adverse effects on us.\nDerivatives legislation and regulation could adversely affect our ability to hedge crude oil and natural gas prices and increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was enacted into law. The Dodd-Frank Act regulates derivative transactions, including our commodity hedging swaps, and could have a number of adverse effects on us, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions, thus exposing us to additional risks related to commodity price volatility; commodity price decreases would then have an increased adverse effect on our profitability and revenues. Reduced hedging may also impair our ability to have certainty with respect to a portion of our cash flows, which could lead to decreases in capital spending and, therefore, decreases in future production and reserves.\n\u2022\nIf, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or its implementing regulations, we are required to post cash collateral in connection with our derivative positions, this would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy.\n\u2022\nOur derivatives counterparties are subject to significant requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect that these requirements will increase the cost to hedge because there will be fewer counterparties in the market and increased counterparty costs will be passed on to us.\nThe above factors could also affect the pricing of derivatives and make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms. The election of President Trump has resulted in uncertainty with respect to the future of the Dodd-Frank Act generally and derivative regulation specifically, and the future impact this may have on PDC is currently unknown.", "PERMNO": 62341, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PDCE"}
