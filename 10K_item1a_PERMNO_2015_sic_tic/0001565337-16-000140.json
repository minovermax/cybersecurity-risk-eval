{"cik": "1565337", "company": "Textura Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the factors described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of cumulative losses and we may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe have not been profitable on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u2018\u2018U.S. GAAP\u2019\u2019) during any quarterly or annual period since our formation in 2004. We incurred net losses of $16.6 million, $24.9 million and $40.3 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $226.0 million. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future due to anticipated increases in research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, operations costs and general and administrative costs. As a result of these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve and maintain future profitability. Although our revenues have increased significantly over the past three years, you should not consider our recent growth as indicative of our future performance, and we expect that our revenue growth rate will decline over time. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including due to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown factors. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future, nor that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.\nEconomic conditions of the global and domestic economy or a substantial or prolonged downturn in the commercial construction business cycle may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEconomic trends that negatively affect the commercial construction industry may adversely affect our business by reducing the number of commercial construction projects that are occurring generally or during a specific period of time, the number of general contractors and subcontractors operating in our markets, or the amount that such clients spend on our solutions. The global and domestic economies continue in certain areas to face a number of economic challenges, including threatened sovereign defaults, credit downgrades, restricted credit for businesses and consumers and potentially falling demand for a variety of products and services. These factors have materially and adversely affected, and may continue to materially and adversely affect, the financial markets and the availability of credit for the commercial construction industry. A reduction in the number of commercial construction projects that are undertaken, the number of general contractors and subcontractors operating in our markets or the amount that clients spend on solutions due to economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results may suffer.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant growth. This rapid growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. We intend to further expand our overall business, client base, headcount and operations, both domestically and internationally. We expect that we will be required to continue to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources to implement our growth strategy. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable operation of our solutions for our clients, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will also need to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, which will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not succeed in developing the market for our solutions and we may face competition that is harmful to our business.\nWe face challenges in developing a market for our solutions and from current and potential products developed or sold by third-party competitors. Currently, our largest source of competition for CPM is from existing manual processes or internally-developed systems that our potential clients have been using for a long period of time and from which they may be reluctant to change. In addition, some competitors address part of CPM\u2019s functional capabilities. We believe that CPM will face increasing\ncompetition as use of on-demand collaboration software by the commercial construction industry develops and evolves. For our solutions other than CPM, we face current competition from both traditional, larger software vendors offering enterprise-wide software applications and services and smaller companies offering point solutions for the commercial construction industry. Our principal competitors vary depending on the solution we offer. Some of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, more comprehensive and varied products and services, and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower priced, or free, products or services that compete with our solutions. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or will be acquired. Some of our competitors may also enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure, reduced profit margins and our loss of market share and could result in one or more competitors with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively limited number of large client relationships and any loss of, or decrease in sales related to, these client relationships could harm our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our relationships with a relatively limited number of large clients, either directly from those clients or from the subcontractors also working on projects that those clients control. Revenue derived from our ten largest client relationships, collectively, accounted for 24% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our largest client relationship accounted for 4% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015. This revenue is largely generated from these clients\u2019 use of our CPM solution, and such clients may terminate use of CPM at any time with relatively short notice with limited or no penalties. We are likely to continue to experience ongoing client concentration, particularly if we are successful in attracting large general contractor clients and in selling additional solutions to our existing clients. In addition, it is possible that revenue from these client relationships, either individually or as a group, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period or that one or more of our existing clients may stop utilizing our solutions entirely. The loss or significant reduction of business from one or more of our major client relationships would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our solutions.\nOur business model depends in large part on our ability to continue to ensure our clients\u2019 satisfaction with our solutions and their resulting decision to continue their reliance on our solutions. If a client is not satisfied with the functionality or quality of our solutions, or with the type of solutions provided, then they may elect to discontinue using our solutions for future projects or we could incur additional costs to address their dissatisfaction. In addition, negative publicity related to our business generally, our client relationships or the satisfaction of our clients, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new enterprise relationships with prospective clients.\nIf our solutions fail to perform properly, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline and we could be subject to liability claims.\nOur solutions are inherently complex and involve the generation and exchange of legal documentation and facilitation of financial transactions. In particular, clients using our CPM solution rely on us to properly generate lien waivers and initiate payment instructions. Our solutions may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, and rely in part on data entered by our clients, the accuracy of which we do not control. This may result in our solutions failing to perform as intended. Such failure may result in:\n\u2022 diversion of development and client service resources;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation;\n\u2022 loss of existing clients and difficulty in attracting new clients;\n\u2022 claims by clients that we are liable for any damages to them as a result of such defects or errors;\n\u2022 increased insurance costs; and\n\u2022 sales credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors or in connection with any of the consequences above might be substantial and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The availability or performance of our solutions could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including clients\u2019 inability to access the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches, variability in user traffic for our solutions or the operation of the ACH Network and other payment clearing systems. Furthermore, because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption, or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant.\nAdditionally, our clients may use our solutions together with software and hardware applications and products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it may be difficult to determine the cause of the problem, and our solutions, even when not the ultimate cause of the problem, may be misidentified as the problem. If our solutions are misidentified as the source of the problem, we might incur costs associated with litigation or correcting the problem, and our reputation could be damaged, resulting in a loss of clients.\nOur client agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages related to defects or errors in our solutions. However, we may not always successfully negotiate such limitations and disclaimers in our client agreement or such provisions may not be enforced by a court or other tribunal or otherwise effectively protect us from such claims.\nAlthough we currently carry errors and omissions insurance, such insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our policy may not cover all claims made against us, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention.\nIf the banks that currently provide ACH services fail to properly transmit ACH files or terminate their relationship with our general contractor clients or limit our ability to process funds on their behalf or our general contractor clients are not able to increase their ACH capacity with existing and new banks, our ability to arrange for funds to be disbursed from the payor\u2019s bank account to the payee\u2019s bank account upon the completion of the invoicing process in our CPM solution could be adversely affected.\nUpon the completion of the invoicing process in our CPM solution, we arrange for funds to be disbursed from the payor\u2019s bank account directly to the payee\u2019s bank account. To do this, we utilize the ACH Network in the United States and similar systems in other countries. If one or more of the banks fails to process ACH transfers on a timely basis, or at all, then our relationship with our clients could be harmed and we could be subject to claims by a client with respect to the failed transfers. If these banks terminate their relationships with our general contractor clients or restrict the dollar amounts of funds that they will process on behalf of our general contractor clients, their doing so may impede our ability to process funds and could have an adverse impact on our CPM solution, and therefore our financial results.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a single software solution.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from sales of CPM. Therefore, any factor adversely affecting sales of this solution, including market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, or economic and market conditions, could have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have a long selling cycle to secure a new enterprise relationship for CPM, which requires significant investments of resources.\nWe typically face a long selling cycle of a year or longer to secure a new enterprise client relationship for CPM, which typically requires significant investment of resources and time by both our clients and us. Our enterprise selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little control, including our clients\u2019 decisions to choose alternatives to our solutions (including internally developed solutions) and the timing of our clients\u2019 budget cycles and approval and implementation processes. Before committing to use our solutions, potential clients require us to spend time and resources educating them on the value of our solutions and assessing the feasibility of integrating our solutions with their existing technology. If a potential client does not ultimately choose our solutions, we are unable to recoup these expenses. Even where we have secured a new enterprise relationship with a general contractor or owner/developer, there are no assurances that the general contractor or owner/developer will choose to use our solutions for any or all of their current or future projects.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our solutions with third-party software applications that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline.\nThe functionality and popularity of our solutions depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our solutions with third-party applications and platforms that our customers use and from which they obtain data. Third-party providers of software applications and APIs may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could limit or prevent our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our solutions, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our solutions with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers expect, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and adversely impact our business.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to cross-sell our solutions.\nA significant component of our growth strategy is to increase cross-selling of our solutions to current and future clients. We may not be successful in cross-selling our solutions, however, if our clients find our additional solutions to be unnecessary or unattractive. We have invested, and may continue to invest, significant resources in developing and acquiring additional solutions, which resources may not be recovered if we are unable to successfully cross-sell these solutions to clients using our existing solutions. Any failure to sell additional solutions to current and future clients could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements, and third parties to enter into non-disclosure agreements. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market solutions similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours. Existing United States federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, the laws of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and its member countries and any other foreign countries in which we may market our solutions in the future, may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. Changes in patent law, such as changes in the law regarding patentable subject matter, could also impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our solutions. For example, amendments to the United States patent law became effective in 2012 and may affect our ability to protect our solutions and defend against claims of patent infringement. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid, may be contested or circumvented or may not prevent the development of competitive solutions. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive. Such legal proceedings or reductions in the legal protection available for intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and we may not prevail.\nWe could be subject to assertions of infringement or other violations by us of intellectual property rights (whether actual or alleged), which could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSoftware and technology companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights or rights related to use of technology. Some software and technology companies, whether our direct competitors or not, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Such litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse\npatent owners who have no relevant product revenue, and therefore our own issued and pending patents may provide little or no deterrence to these patent owners in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. Existing laws and regulations are evolving and subject to different interpretations, and various federal and state legislative or regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws or regulations. Although we believe that our solutions do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights or rights related to use of technology.\nAny intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claim or assertion against us, our clients or strategic alliance partners, and those from whom we license technology and intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects regardless of the validity or outcome. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court, or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s intellectual property; cease making, licensing or using technology, content or material that is alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our technology; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content or materials; and to indemnify our partners and other third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. In addition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nWe rely on technology and intellectual property of third parties, the loss of which could limit the functionality of our solutions and disrupt our business.\nWe use technology and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third parties in certain of our solutions, and we may license additional third-party technology and intellectual property in the future. Any errors or defects in this third-party technology and intellectual property could result in errors that could harm our brand and business. In addition, licensed technology and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of the right to use or allow our clients to use this third party technology could limit the functionality of our solutions and might require us to redesign our solutions. Further, although we believe that there are currently adequate replacements for the third-party technology and intellectual property we presently use, the loss of our right to use any of this technology and intellectual property could result in delays in producing or providing affected solutions until equivalent technology or intellectual property is identified, licensed or otherwise procured, and integrated. Our business would be disrupted if any technology and intellectual property we license from others or functional equivalents of this software were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, we would be required either to attempt to redesign our solutions to function with technology and intellectual property available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in sales and the release of new solution offerings. Alternatively, we might be forced to limit the features available in affected solutions. Any of these results could harm our business and impact our results of operations.\nThe use of open source software in our solutions and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nWe use open source software development tools and may incorporate open source software into portions of our technology. Given the nature of open source software, third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by United States or foreign courts, and there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solutions, to redevelop our solutions, to discontinue sales of our solutions or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSome of our solutions use software development tools that are subject to one or more open source licenses. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. This can subject previously proprietary\nsoftware to open source license terms. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our solutions, processes and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related solution when we do not wish to do so, such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our proprietary solutions. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products and solutions, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our solutions. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCertain of our solutions are dependent on the use and acceptance of electronic signatures, which are governed by relatively new laws and their acceptance in the commercial construction industry may not be complete.\nIn the United States, the enforceability of electronic transactions is primarily governed by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, a federal law enacted in 2000 that largely preempts inconsistent state law, and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, a uniform state law that was finalized by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1999 and has now been adopted by most states. If, in the United States or other markets where we offer our solutions, a court were to find that electronic signatures are insufficient to establish that the documents generated by our system have been signed by an authorized person, existing laws were to change, or participants in the commercial construction industry were unwilling to rely on electronic signatures, then acceptance of our solutions would be adversely affected.\nOur business is substantially dependent on market demand for, and acceptance of, the on-demand model for the use of software in the commercial construction industry.\nWe sell our collaboration solutions as on-demand solutions, which are an alternative to traditional licensed hardware and software solutions, and solutions developed in-house to which many of our clients or potential clients are accustomed. Our collaboration solutions rely on the acceptance and proliferation of web-based software, which may not be widespread or happen in a timely fashion. Under the perpetual or periodic license model for software procurement, users of the software typically run applications on their hardware. Because commercial construction companies utilizing these perpetual or periodic license models may be predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to the concept of accessing the functionality of software provided as a service through a third party.\nFurthermore, many commercial construction companies currently conduct the business processes that our collaboration solutions support using paper-based processes and a combination of mail services, telephone, facsimile, email and the Internet. Growth in the demand for our collaboration solutions depends on the adoption of our technology-enabled commercial construction management solutions and we may not be able to persuade these prospective clients to change their traditional processes. If our collaboration solutions are not accepted by the commercial construction industry or if the market for on-demand solutions fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our collaboration solutions could be negatively affected.\nIf we are not successful in expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future results depend, in part, on our ability to expand into international markets. We currently operate primarily in the United States and Canada. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver solution functionality and foreign language translations that reflect the needs of the local commercial construction industries of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or in unfamiliar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through strategic alliances. If we are unable to identify strategic alliance partners or negotiate favorable alliance terms, our international growth may be hampered. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur expenses in advance of generating material revenues as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets.\nExpansion internationally will also require significant attention from our management and will require us to add additional management and other resources in these markets. Our ability to expand our business and to attract talented employees and strategic alliances in an increasing number of international markets requires considerable management attention and resources\nand is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems, commercial infrastructures and technology infrastructure. If we are unable to grow our international operations in a timely manner, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be materially adversely affected.\nAs we expand internationally, our business will become more susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe currently operate primarily in the United States and Canada. Our limited experience in operating our business outside the United States increases the risk that our current and future international expansion efforts may not be successful. In particular, our business model may not be successful in particular countries or regions outside the United States for reasons that we currently are unable to anticipate. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These include:\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing the staffing of international operations;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax rates;\n\u2022 dependence on strategic alliance partners to increase client acquisition;\n\u2022 the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards;\n\u2022 data privacy laws that require that client data be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022 political, social and economic instability abroad;\n\u2022 laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022 terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u2022 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022 exposure to liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and similar laws.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our operating results. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future. If we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or partners or to achieve expected benefits from such acquisitions or partnerships, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs part of our ongoing business strategy to expand our suite of solutions and acquire new technology, we engage from time to time in discussions with third parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures. There may be significant competition for acquisition targets in our industry, or we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate attractive terms for acquisitions or complete acquisitions on expected timelines, or at all. If we are unable to complete strategic acquisitions or do not realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions we do complete, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will be successful, such transactions are inherently risky. Significant risks to these potential transactions include the following:\n\u2022 integration and restructuring costs, both one-time and ongoing;\n\u2022 maintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations;\n\u2022 establishing new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u2022 losing key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022 failing to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary products or services;\n\u2022 our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022 uncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022 our dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022 insufficient revenue to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022 our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022 unanticipated and unknown liabilities.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions in the future or do not realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions we do complete, we may be required to reevaluate our acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions, some of which may ultimately not be consummated or not result in expected benefits. The occurrence of any of these acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unsuccessful in increasing the number of industries we serve, our growth could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to successfully penetrate new industries. In order to grow our business, we expect to expand to other project-focused adjacent industries in which we have little or no experience, such as mining or oil and gas. Expanding into new industries may require considerable investment of technical, financial and marketing resources, the scope of which is difficult to predict. Failure to successfully enter new industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause we recognize revenues over future periods, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize as revenue fees from clients ratably over future periods. As a result, a significant portion of the revenues we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments received during previous quarters. Consequently, downturns or upturns in the commercial construction industry, or increases or decreases to our new sales, in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter, but will continue to affect our revenues in future quarters. Our fee model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period. Accordingly, the effect of changes in the commercial construction industry impacting our business or changes we experience in our new sales may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations.\nWe may be unable to develop and bring to market new solutions in a timely manner.\nOur growth and success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop and bring to market new solutions, including an integrated platform. The length of the development cycle varies depending on the nature and complexity of a solution, the availability of development resources, solution management and other internal resources, and the role, if any, of strategic partners. The time, expense and resources associated with developing and bringing to market new solutions may be greater than we anticipate and we may therefore be unable to develop and bring additional solutions to market in a timely manner or at all. The foregoing could result in a loss of market share to competitors who are able to offer these additional solutions, rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, and increases in service and support costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team could disrupt the management of our business and materially impair the success of our business.\nWe believe that our success depends on the continued contributions of the members of our senior management team. We rely on our executive officers and other key managers for the successful performance of our business. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key managers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although we have employment arrangements with certain members of our senior management team, none of these arrangements prevents any of our employees from leaving us. The loss of any executive officer or key manager could materially impair our ability to perform successfully, including achieving satisfactory operating results and maintaining our growth.\nWe may fail to attract and retain qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our clients.\nWe plan to continue to expand our work force to increase our client base and revenue. We believe that there is significant competition for qualified personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If our recruiting, training and retention efforts are not successful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes in regulations or failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nThe future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or foreign governmental entities have adopted, and may adopt, changes in or new laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium, including laws and regulations concerning data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. Foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, also govern the processing of personal information. Further, laws, such as the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, are increasingly aimed at restricting the use of personal information for marketing purposes. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing or inconsistent interpretations among the enforcement authorities of the various applicable jurisdictions. Changes in domestic and foreign laws or regulations could require us to modify our solutions in order to ensure continued compliance. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose or increase taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet. These changes in laws or charges could limit the growth of internet-related commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for internet-based solutions such as ours.\nWe may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could adversely harm our business.\nState, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to our solutions in various jurisdictions is unclear. Further, these jurisdictions' rules regarding tax nexus are complex and vary significantly. As a result, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits, and our liability for these taxes and associated penalties could exceed our original estimates. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage clients from purchasing our solutions or otherwise harm our business and operating results.\nOur future success depends on continued growth in the use of the Internet by our clients, our clients\u2019 access to the Internet and their confidence that other participants in the commercial construction industry have such access.\nBecause our collaboration solutions are designed to work over the Internet, our revenue growth depends on the ability of our clients and other participants in the commercial construction industry to access to the Internet. If potential clients do not have reliable access to the Internet or are not willing to use the Internet for business purposes, we will not be able to sell our collaboration solutions to them. Additionally, our potential and current clients may be reluctant to adopt or continue to use our collaboration solutions if they are not confident that other participants in the commercial construction industry have access to the Internet, as this would limit the ability of these participants to use our collaboration solutions.\nBecause construction sites are sometimes in remote and isolated locations, our current and potential clients may have additional reason to believe that access to the Internet by some participants in the commercial construction industry may be unreasonably difficult or impossible. The future delivery of our collaboration solutions will therefore depend, in part, on third-party internet service providers continuing to expand the availability of internet services, maintaining a reliable network with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, and developing complementary products and services for providing reliable and timely internet access and services. If access to the Internet by participants in the commercial construction industry is not readily available, demand for our collaboration solutions could be negatively affected.\nInterruptions or delays in the services provided by third-party data centers and/or internet service providers could impair the delivery of our solutions and our business could suffer.\nThe primary data center supporting our CPM, GradeBeam and PQM solutions is located at a third-party site in Oak Brook, Illinois. Although we maintain a backup facility at our corporate headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, both facilities are located in the same metropolitan area and could be subject to the same damage or service interruptions that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, system error, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, war, criminal act, military action, terrorist attack and other similar events beyond our control. A prolonged service disruption affecting our collaboration solutions for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, could damage our reputation with current and potential clients, expose us to liability, cause us to lose clients from whom we receive recurring revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data centers we use. Our collaboration solutions are accessed by a large number of clients often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our clients and solutions available to our clients, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of our third-party data centers or third-party internet service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our collaboration solutions or impede our ability to scale our operations. In the event that our data center or third-party internet service provider arrangements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our collaboration solutions as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services.\nWe face risks related to the storage of our clients\u2019 confidential and proprietary information.\nOur collaboration solutions are designed to maintain the confidentiality and security of our clients\u2019 confidential and proprietary information that is stored on our systems, including financial information, information regarding their business plans and other critical data. However, any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to this data could expose us to liability for the loss of such information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are difficult to recognize and react to. We and our third-party data center facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or reactionary measures. We could be subject to legal claims or harm to our reputation if we or our third-party service providers fail to comply or are seen as failing to comply with our policies concerning confidential and proprietary information or if our policies are inadequate.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital and we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features for our existing solutions or new solutions, or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. We therefore may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure\nadditional capital. However, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results.\nU.S. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u2018\u2018FASB\u2019\u2019 ), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Accounting for revenue from sales of our solutions is particularly complex, is often the subject of intense scrutiny by the SEC, and will evolve as FASB continues to consider applicable accounting standards in this area.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions. Our earnings will be harmed if we suffer an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform an annual, or in certain situations a more frequent, assessment for possible impairment for accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2015, our net goodwill and other intangible asset balances totaled $60.8 million, or 33% of our total assets. If we do not achieve our planned operating results or other factors impair these assets, we may be required to incur a non-cash impairment charge. Any impairment charges in the future will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of the commercial construction on-demand market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nDevelopment and expansion of our Early Payment Program solution may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, for which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\nThe development and expansion of our Early Payment Program solution may subject us to additional risks and regulatory requirements, including laws covering money transmission and anti-money laundering. These requirements vary throughout the markets in which we operate, and several jurisdictions lack clarity in the application and interpretation of these rules. There is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, criminal and civil lawsuits or other regulatory enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, or be required to adjust business practices to accommodate future regulatory requirements.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur directors and executive officers and their affiliates have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of February 26, 2016, our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 23% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, would have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, if acting together, would have significant influence over the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by, among other things:\n\u2022 delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u2022 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022 discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain\ncontrol of us.\nAs an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 we may rely on the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u2018\u2018emerging growth companies\u2019\u2019 including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company\u2019\u2019 until June 6, 2018, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, or if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, we would cease to be an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company\u2019\u2019 as of the end of that fiscal year, or if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, we would cease to be an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company\u2019\u2019 immediately. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act or maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, it could result in late or non-compliant filings or inaccurate financial reporting and have a negative impact on the price of our common stock or our business.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide timely, reliable financial reporting and prevent fraud. Prior to becoming a public company, we were not required to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u2018\u2018Exchange Act\u2019\u2019), or with the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a public company, we are required to report our financial results on the timeline and in the form prescribed by the Exchange Act, and we have been developing our accounting and finance functions to support these requirements. While we believe that the changes we have made are sufficient to enable us to meet these requirements, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to prevent errors in our financial statements in future periods. In addition, although we are required to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until we are no longer an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 as described above. At such time that an attestation is required, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that we have one or more material weaknesses. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid material weaknesses in the future.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022 the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022 the ability of our Board of Directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction.\nIf we issue additional securities to raise capital, it may have a dilutive effect on your investment.\nIf we raise additional capital through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of us. Moreover, any new equity securities (other than common stock) we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company and our industry, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price for our common stock is influenced by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business, our industry, or technology companies in general. If any of the analysts who cover us or may cover us in the future change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us or may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any gains on their investments for the foreseeable future.\nThe trading price of our stock is highly volatile.\nOur common stock began trading on the NYSE on June 7, 2013 and since that date has fluctuated from a high of $47.25 per share to a low of $13.13 per share. We expect that the trading price of our common stock will continue to be volatile due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 failure to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 reports by the financial media, investors, short sellers and other capital markets participants;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 success of competitive products or services;\n\u2022 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022 announcements by us, our competitors or our clients of significant product releases, contracts, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances or capital commitments;\n\u2022 loss of one or more significant clients or strategic alliances;\n\u2022 changes in laws or regulations relating to our solutions;\n\u2022 litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022 changes in general economic, industry and market conditions, including events pertaining to the commercial construction industry;\n\u2022 investors\u2019 general perception of us; and\n\u2022 additions or departures of key employees, directors or both.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nIf we fail to forecast the timing of our revenues or expenses accurately, our operating results could be materially lower than anticipated, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe use a variety of factors in our forecasting and planning processes, including historical trends, recent client history, expectations of client buying decisions, client implementation schedules and plans, analyses by our sales and service teams, maintenance renewal rates, our assessment of economic or market conditions and many other factors. While these analyses have historically provided and may continue to provide us with some guidance in business planning and expense management, these estimates are inherently imprecise and may not accurately predict our revenue or expenses in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time. A variation in any or all of these factors could cause us to inaccurately forecast our revenues or expenses and could result in expenditures without corresponding revenue. As a result, our operating results could be materially lower than anticipated in our quarterly or annual forecasts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could prevent us from meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe recognize project fees and usage fees ratably over the average estimated life of the project and contract, respectively. The average estimated life of the project and contract is estimated by management based on periodic review and analysis of historical data. The applicable estimated life is based on the project or contract value falling within certain predetermined ranges, as well as the solution on which the project is being managed. We perform periodic reviews of actual project and contract data and revise our estimates as necessary. This may impact the forecasting of the timing of our revenues accurately, our revenues could be materially lower than anticipated, which may cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 14005, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "TXTR"}
