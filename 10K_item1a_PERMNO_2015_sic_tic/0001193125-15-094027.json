RISK FACTORS\nA wide range of factors could materially affect our overall performance, the performance of particular businesses and our results of operations, and therefore, an investment in us is subject to risks and uncertainties. In addition to factors affecting specific business operations and the financial results of those operations identified elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following factors, among others, could adversely affect our operations. While each risk is described separately below, some of these risks are interrelated and it is possible that certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below. Also, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that are currently deemed immaterial, could also potentially impair our overall performance, the performance of particular businesses and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nWe have experienced significant historical, and may experience significant future, operating losses and net losses, which may hinder our ability to meet working capital requirements or service our indebtedness, and we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet such requirements or service our indebtedness.\nWe cannot assure you that we will recognize net income in future periods. If we cannot generate net income or sufficient operating profitability, we may not be able to meet our working capital requirements or service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate sufficient cash for our operations will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We recognized a net loss of $12.1 million in 2014, net income of $111.6 million in 2013 (after taking into account $148.8 million of gain from the sale of discontinued operations, net of tax) and net income of $27.9 million in 2012 (after taking into account $94.3 million of gain from the sale of discontinued operations, net of tax), and have incurred net losses in prior periods.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets and/or seek additional capital or financings. Our ability to obtain financings will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any financings could be at high interest rates and may require us to comply with covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such disposition may not be adequate to meet our obligations. We recognized cash flows from operating activities of $32.8 million in 2014, $(20.3) million in 2013 and $23.6 million in 2012.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss and other tax carryforwards.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and other tax carryforward amounts to reduce taxable income in future years may be limited for various reasons, including if future taxable income is insufficient to recognize the full benefit of such NOL carryforward amounts prior to their expiration. Additionally, our ability to fully utilize these U.S. tax assets can also be adversely affected by \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% increase in equity ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any three year period.\nIn 2014, substantial acquisitions of our common stock were reported by new beneficial owners on Schedule 13D filings made with the SEC and we issued shares of our Preferred Stock, which are convertible into a substantial number of shares of our common stock. During the second quarter of 2014, we completed a Section 382 review. The conclusions of this review indicated that an ownership change had occurred as of May 29, 2014. Our annual Section 382 base limit following the ownership change is estimated to be $2.16 million per year. As of December 31, 2014, we had an estimated U.S. NOL carryforward in the amount of $60.1 million.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel, the loss of which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nHC2 and its operating subsidiaries depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of HC2\u2019s and each such subsidiary\u2019s executive management team and other key personnel, which may consist of a relatively small number of individuals that possess sales, marketing, engineering, financial and other\nskills that are critical to the operation of our businesses. The ability to retain officers and key senior employees is important to our success and future growth. Competition for these professionals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain and motivate our existing management and key personnel, and continue to compensate such individuals competitively. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our businesses, and could hinder the ability of such businesses to effectively compete in the various industries in which we operate.\nWe may not be able to attract additional skilled personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract new personnel, including management and technical and sales personnel, necessary for future growth or to replace lost personnel. Competition for the best personnel in our businesses can be intense. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to attract qualified personnel.\nBecause we face significant competition for acquisition and business opportunities, including from numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours, it may be difficult for us to fully execute our business strategy. Additionally, our subsidiaries also operate in highly competitive industries, limiting their ability to gain or maintain their positions in their respective industries.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition for acquisition and business opportunities from both strategic investors and other entities having a business objective similar to ours, such as private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), blank check companies, and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the type of businesses that we may intend to acquire. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources, or more local industry knowledge, or greater access to capital, than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully completing future acquisitions and investments.\nIn addition, while we believe that there are numerous target businesses that we could potentially acquire or invest in, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. We may need to obtain additional financing in order to consummate future acquisitions and investment opportunities and cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities.\nFurthermore, our subsidiaries also face competition from both traditional and new market entrants that may adversely affect them as well, as discussed below in the risk factors related to Schuff, GMSL and our ICS operations.\nFuture acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a diversified holding company that owns interests in a number of different businesses. We have in the past, and may in the future, acquire businesses or make investments, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, that involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the investment or acquisition targets operate, including risks in industries with which we are not familiar or experienced. Although we intend to conduct appropriate business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future investment or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by such investments or acquisitions, especially if we are unfamiliar with the relevant industry. The realization of any unknown risks could expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities and prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the investments\nor acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, our financial condition, results of operations and the ability to service our debt may be adversely impacted depending on the specific risks applicable to any business we invest in or acquire and our ability to address those risks.\nWe will increase our size in the future, and may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe have adopted a business strategy that contemplates that we will expand our operations, including in connection with or in anticipation of any future acquisitions or other business opportunities, and as a result we are required to increase our level of corporate functions, which may include hiring additional personnel to perform such functions and enhancing our information technology systems. Any future growth may increase our corporate operating costs and expenses and impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees and implement enhanced informational technology systems. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nOur officers, directors, stockholders and their respective affiliates may have a pecuniary interest in certain transactions in which we are involved, and may also compete with us.\nWhile we have adopted a code of ethics applicable to our officers and directors reasonably designed to promote the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships, we have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. We have in the past engaged in transactions in which such persons have an interest and, subject to the terms of any applicable covenants in financing arrangements or other agreements we may enter into from time to time, may in the future enter into additional transactions in which such persons have an interest. In addition, such parties may have an interest in certain transactions such as strategic partnerships or joint ventures in which we are involved, and may also compete with us.\nIn the course of their other business activities, certain of our current and future directors and officers may become aware of business and acquisition opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to our Company as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Such directors and officers may therefore not present otherwise attractive business or acquisition opportunities to us.\nCertain of our current and future directors and officers may become aware of business and acquisition opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are or may be affiliated. Due to those directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 affiliations with other entities, they may have obligations to present potential business and acquisition opportunities to those entities, which could cause conflicts of interest. Moreover, in accordance with Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation contains a provision that renounces our expectation to certain corporate opportunities that are presented to our current and future directors that serve in capacities with other entities. Accordingly, our directors and officers may not present otherwise attractive business or acquisition opportunities to us.\nWe may suffer adverse consequences if we are deemed an investment company and we may incur significant costs to avoid investment company status.\nWe have not held, and do not hold, ourselves out as an investment company and do not believe we are an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the SEC or a court were to disagree with us, we could be required to register as an investment company. This would subject us to disclosure and accounting rules geared toward investment, rather than operating, companies; limiting our ability to borrow money, issue options, issue multiple classes of stock and debt, and engage in transactions with affiliates; and requiring us to undertake significant costs and expenses to meet the disclosure and regulatory requirements to which we would be subject as a registered investment company.\nFrom time to time we may be subject to litigation for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which, if adversely determined, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are or may become party to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary or routine litigation incidental to our current or prior businesses or not material to our financial position or results of operations. We also are or may become party to legal proceedings with the potential to be material to our financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation in which we may become involved, or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any potential losses. To the extent that we sustain losses from any pending litigation which are not reserved or otherwise provided for or insured against, our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nFurther deterioration of global economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nThe global economy and capital and credit markets have experienced exceptional turmoil and upheaval over the past several years. Many major economies worldwide entered significant economic recessions beginning in 2007 and continue to experience economic weakness, with the potential for another economic downturn to occur. Ongoing concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and widespread recession and potentially prolonged economic recovery, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability, cost and terms of credit, consumer and business confidence and demand, and substantially increased unemployment rates have all contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for many established and emerging economies, including those in which we operate. These general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations, results of operations and overall financial condition.\nThe availability, cost and terms of credit also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers over the past several years, and a corresponding slowdown in global infrastructure spending. Continued uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets and economies and prolonged stagnation in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers, including our ability to access capital markets and obtain capital lease financing to meet liquidity needs.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and in foreign currencies may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe conduct various operations outside the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom. As a result, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. These exposures include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nre-measurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\ntranslation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars, our functional currency, upon consolidation; and\n\u2022\nplanning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur.\nDepending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if we choose to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure, we could experience a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition. As we have seen in some recent periods, in the event of volatility in exchange rates, these exposures can increase, and the impact on our results of operations and financial condition can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures more complex and costly.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations.\nWe operate in international markets, and may in the future consummate additional investments in or acquisitions of foreign businesses. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\npolitical conditions and events, including embargoes;\n\u2022\nrestrictive actions by U.S. and foreign governments;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange controls and import/export quotas;\n\u2022\nnationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nloss of contract rights and inability to adequately enforce contracts;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist attacks, piracy and kidnapping;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of pandemic diseases or fear of such outbreaks;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for our services and our profitability;\n\u2022\npotential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\ndifferent liability standards and legal systems that may be less developed and less predictable than those in the United States.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, we could lose our ability to operate in certain international markets and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, Treasury and other agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of export controls, the FCPA, and other federal statutes, sanctions and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and, increasingly, similar or more restrictive foreign laws, rules and regulations. By virtue of these laws and regulations, and under laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, we may be obliged to limit our business activities, we may incur costs for compliance programs and we may be subject to enforcement actions or penalties for noncompliance. In recent years, U.S. and foreign governments have increased their oversight and enforcement activities with respect to these laws and we expect the relevant agencies to continue to increase these activities. A violation of these laws, sanctions or regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have compliance policies in place for our employees with respect to FCPA, OFAC and similar laws, but there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC and other laws, sanctions or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the preparation and review of our income tax provisions and related accounts, which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As disclosed in Item 9A, \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\u201d management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for income taxes, including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities which resulted in a net non-cash adjustment of approximately $4 million to our internal tax provision calculation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014. The assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have discussed the identified control deficiency in our financial reporting and the remediation of such deficiency with the audit committee of our board of directors and will continue to do so as necessary. We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. We could incur additional expense and devote management resources in remediating the material weakness in 2015. If the new controls being implemented to address the material weakness and to strengthen the overall internal control over accounting for income taxes are not designed or do not operate effectively, or if the Company is unsuccessful in implementing or following these new processes or is otherwise unable to remediate this material weakness, it may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any such additional weakness or failure to remediate the existing weakness could adversely affect our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and the requirements of our financing arrangements, which could adversely affect our financial condition. The material weakness does not have any impact on prior issued financial statements and management believes the current balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows are accurate.\nWe may be required to expend substantial sums in order to bring Schuff and GMSL, as well as other companies we have acquired or may acquire in the future, into compliance with the various reporting requirements applicable to public companies and/or to prepare required financial statements, and such efforts may harm our operating results or be unsuccessful altogether.\nPrior to our acquisition of Schuff and GMSL, such companies were not subject to many of the requirements applicable to public companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which requires that Schuff and GMSL evaluate and report on their system of internal controls. We will need to evaluate and integrate the system of internal controls for Schuff and GMSL. We did not conduct a formal evaluation of Schuff and GMSL\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting prior to our acquisition of those companies. Moreover, as disclosed under Item 9A, \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\u201d in accordance with SEC rules, we have excluded from management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 the internal controls over financial reporting of businesses that we acquired in 2014, including Schuff and GMSL. If we discover any material\nweaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in companies we acquire, including Schuff and GMSL, as we continue to assess such controls we may be required to hire additional staff and incur substantial legal and accounting costs to address such inadequacies. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our remedial measures will be effective. Any failure to implement required or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or increase its risk of material weaknesses in internal controls, in addition to the risks described under \u201cWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the preparation and review of our income tax provisions and related accounts, which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\u201d\nWe face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and lack of control over investments in associates.\nIn pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. Once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. For example, if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction, goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods. The negotiations associated with the acquisition and disposition of businesses could also disrupt our ongoing business, distract management and employees or increase our expenses.\nIn addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully, including Schuff and GMSL, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.\nIn addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in disposing of the excess or idle facilities of an acquired company or business and expenses in maintaining such facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of and potential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws and regulations of various jurisdictions to which the business acquired is subject.\nWe also own an interest in a number of entities, such as Novatel, over which we do not exercise or have only little management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration.\nWe have incurred substantial costs in connection with our prior acquisitions and expect to incur substantial costs in connection with any other transaction we complete in the future, which may increase our indebtedness or reduce the amount of our available cash and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe have incurred substantial costs in connection with our prior acquisitions and expect to incur substantial costs in connection with any other transactions we complete in the future. These costs may increase our\nindebtedness or reduce the amount of cash otherwise available to us for acquisitions, business opportunities and other corporate purposes. There is no assurance that the actual costs will not exceed our estimates. We may continue to incur additional material charges reflecting additional costs associated with our investments and the integration of our acquisitions, including our acquisition of Schuff and GMSL, in fiscal quarters subsequent to the quarter in which such investments and acquisitions were consummated.\nWe could consume resources in researching acquisitions, business opportunities or financings and capital market transactions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or invest in another business.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific acquisition or business opportunity and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments with respect to such transaction will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for financial advisors, accountants, attorneys and other advisors. If a decision is made not to consummate a specific acquisition, business opportunity or financing and capital market transaction, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific acquisition, investment target or financing, we may fail to consummate the investment or acquisition for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control. Any such event could consume significant management time and result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, which could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to consummate other acquisitions and investments.\nOur participation in current or any future joint investment could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on a partner\u2019s financial condition and disputes between us and the relevant partners.\nWe have, indirectly through our subsidiaries, formed joint ventures, and may in the future engage in similar joint ventures with third parties. For example, Schuff has formed the Schuff Hopsa Engineering, Inc. joint venture located in Panama, and GMSL operates various joint ventures outside of the United States. In such circumstances, we may not be in a position to exercise significant decision-making authority if we do not own a substantial majority of the equity interests of such joint venture or otherwise have contractual rights entitling us to exercise such authority. These ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners might become insolvent or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. In addition, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Disputes between us and partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our costs and expenses and divert a substantial amount of management\u2019s time and effort away from our businesses. We may also, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our third-party partners.\nThere may be tax consequences associated with our acquisition, investment, holding and disposition of target companies and assets.\nWe may incur significant taxes in connection with effecting acquisitions of or investments in, holding, receiving payments from, operating or disposing of target companies and assets. Our decision to make a particular acquisition, sell a particular asset or increase or decrease a particular investment may be based on considerations other than the timing and amount of taxes owed as a result thereof.\nWe rely on information systems to conduct our businesses, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches and otherwise maintain such systems in working order could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of our businesses is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches, and we rely on industry-accepted security measures and\ntechnology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any other reason could disrupt our businesses and result in decreased performance and increased costs, causing our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition to suffer.\nRisks Related to Schuff\nSchuff\u2019s business is dependent upon major construction contracts, the unpredictable timing of which may result in significant fluctuations in its cash flow due to the timing of receipt of payment under such contracts.\nSchuff\u2019s cash flow is dependent upon obtaining major construction contracts primarily from general contractors and engineering firms responsible for commercial and industrial construction projects, such as high- and low-rise buildings and office complexes, hotels and casinos, convention centers, sports arenas, shopping malls, hospitals, dams, bridges, mines and power plants. The timing of or failure to obtain contracts, delays in awards of contracts, cancellations of contracts, delays in completion of contracts, or failure to obtain timely payment from Schuff\u2019s customers, could result in significant periodic fluctuations in cash flows from Schuff\u2019s operations. In addition, many of Schuff\u2019s contracts require it to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. As a result, Schuff may incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe nature of Schuff\u2019s primary contracting terms for its contracts, including fixed-price and cost-plus pricing, could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSchuff\u2019s projects are awarded through a competitive bid process or are obtained through negotiation, in either case generally using one of two types of contract pricing approaches: fixed-price or cost-plus pricing. Under fixed-price contracts, Schuff performs its services and executes its projects at an established price, subject to adjustment only for change orders approved by the customer, and, as a result, it may benefit from cost savings but be unable to recover any cost overruns. If Schuff does not execute such a contract within cost estimates, it may incur losses or the project may be less profitable than expected. Historically, the majority of Schuff\u2019s contracts have been fixed-price arrangements. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on such contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nfailure to properly estimate costs of materials, including steel and steel components, engineering services, equipment, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022\ncosts incurred in connection with modifications to a contract that may be unapproved by the customer as to scope, schedule, and/or price;\n\u2022\nunanticipated technical problems with the structures, equipment or systems we supply;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or claims, including costs for project modifications, customer-caused delays, errors or changes in specifications or designs, or contract termination;\n\u2022\nchanges in the costs of materials, engineering services, equipment, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions, including the availability and productivity of labor;\n\u2022\nproductivity and other delays caused by weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfailure to engage necessary suppliers or subcontractors, or failure of such suppliers or subcontractors to perform;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions.\nUnder cost-plus contracts, Schuff receives reimbursement for its direct labor and material cost, plus a specified fee in excess thereof, which is typically a fixed rate per hour, an overall fixed fee, or a percentage of total reimbursable costs, up to a maximum amount, which is an arrangement that may protect Schuff against cost overruns. If Schuff is unable to obtain proper reimbursement for all costs incurred due to improper estimates, performance issues, customer disputes, or any of the additional factors noted above for fixed-price contracts, the project may be less profitable than expected.\nGenerally, Schuff\u2019s contracts and projects vary in length from 1 to 12 months, depending on the size and complexity of the project, project owner demands and other factors. The foregoing risks are exacerbated for projects with longer-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances upon which Schuff based its original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. In addition, Schuff sometimes bears the risk of delays caused by unexpected conditions or events. To the extent there are future cost increases that Schuff cannot recover from its customers, suppliers or subcontractors, the outcome could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFurthermore, revenue and gross profit from Schuff\u2019s contracts can be affected by contract incentives or penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contract term. Some of Schuff\u2019s contracts provide for the customer\u2019s review of its accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced. These reviews could result in reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer.\nThe cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress. Due to the various estimates inherent in Schuff\u2019s contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSchuff\u2019s billed and unbilled revenue may be exposed to potential risk if a project is terminated or canceled or if Schuff\u2019s customers encounter financial difficulties.\nSchuff\u2019s contracts often require it to satisfy or achieve certain milestones in order to receive payment for the work performed. As a result, under these types of arrangements, Schuff may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment. If the ultimate customer does not proceed with the completion of the project or if the customer or contractor under which Schuff is a subcontractor defaults on its payment obligations, Schuff may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to it for the costs previously incurred. If Schuff is unable to collect amounts owed to it, this could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSchuff may be exposed to additional risks as it obtains new significant awards and executes its backlog, including greater backlog concentration in fewer projects, potential cost overruns and increasing requirements for letters of credit, each of which could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAs Schuff obtains new significant project awards, these projects may use larger sums of working capital than other projects and Schuff\u2019s backlog may become concentrated among a smaller number of customers. Approximately $203.1 million, representing 56.9%, of Schuff\u2019s backlog at December 31, 2014 was attributable to five contracts, letters of intent, notices to proceed or purchase orders. If any significant projects such as these currently included in Schuff\u2019s backlog or awarded in the future were to have material cost overruns, or be significantly delayed, modified or canceled, Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, as Schuff converts its significant projects from backlog into active construction, it may face significantly greater requirements for the provision of letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancements. We can provide no assurance that Schuff would be able to access such capital and credit as needed or that it would be able to do so on economically attractive terms. Moreover, Schuff may be unable to replace the projects that it executes in its backlog.\nSchuff may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in its backlog, a substantial portion of which is attributable to a relatively small number of large contracts or other commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Schuff had a backlog of work to be completed of approximately $357.0 million ($305.3 million under contracts or purchase orders and $51.7 million under letters of intent). Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the revenue value of new project commitments received by Schuff during a given period, including legally binding commitments without a defined scope. Commitments may be in the form of written contracts, letters of intent, notices to proceed and purchase orders. New awards may also include estimated amounts of work to be performed based on customer communication and historic experience and knowledge of our customers\u2019 intentions. Backlog consists of projects which have either not yet been started or are in progress but are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed, which increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under a given commitment. The revenue projected in Schuff\u2019s backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not be profitable as a result of poor contract terms or performance.\nDue to project terminations, suspensions or changes in project scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when or if Schuff\u2019s backlog will be performed. From time to time, projects are canceled that appeared to have a high certainty of going forward at the time they were recorded as new awards. In the event of a project cancellation, Schuff typically has no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in its backlog. Some of the contracts in Schuff\u2019s backlog provide for cancellation fees or certain reimbursements in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of Schuff\u2019s out-of-pocket costs, costs associated with work performed prior to cancellation, and, to varying degrees, a percentage of the profit Schuff would have realized had the contract been completed. Although Schuff may be reimbursed for certain costs, it may be unable to recover all direct costs incurred and may incur additional unrecoverable costs due to the resulting under-utilization of Schuff\u2019s assets. Approximately $203.1 million, representing 56.9%, of Schuff\u2019s backlog at December 31, 2014 was attributable to five contracts, letters of intent, notices to proceed or purchase orders. If one or more of these large contracts or other commitments are terminated or their scope reduced, Schuff\u2019s backlog could decrease substantially.\nSchuff\u2019s failure to meet contractual schedule or performance requirements could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn certain circumstances, Schuff guarantees project completion by a scheduled date or certain performance levels. Failure to meet these schedule or performance requirements could result in a reduction of revenue and additional costs, and these adjustments could exceed projected profit. Project revenue or profit could also be reduced by liquidated damages withheld by customers under contractual penalty provisions, which can be substantial and can accrue on a daily basis. Schedule delays can result in costs exceeding our projections for a particular project. Performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those previously anticipated and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our customer base.\nSchuff\u2019s government contracts may be subject to modification or termination, which could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSchuff is a provider of services to U.S. government agencies and is therefore exposed to risks associated with government contracting. Government agencies typically can terminate or modify contracts to which Schuff\nis a party at their convenience, due to budget constraints or various other reasons. As a result, Schuff\u2019s backlog may be reduced or it may incur a loss if a government agency decides to terminate or modify a contract to which Schuff is a party. Schuff is also subject to audits, including audits of internal control systems, cost reviews and investigations by government contracting oversight agencies. As a result of an audit, the oversight agency may disallow certain costs or withhold a percentage of interim payments. Cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenue and may require Schuff to refund a portion of previously collected amounts. In addition, failure to comply with the terms of one or more of our government contracts or government regulations and statutes could result in Schuff being suspended or debarred from future government projects for a significant period of time, possible civil or criminal fines and penalties, the risk of public scrutiny of our performance, and potential harm to Schuff\u2019s reputation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Other remedies that government agencies may seek for improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as forfeiture of profit and suspension of payments.\nIn addition to the risks noted above, legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and Schuff may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts. Appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by, among other things, the state of the economy, competing political priorities, curtailments in the use of government contracting firms, budget constraints, the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures.\nSchuff is exposed to potential risks and uncertainties associated with its reliance on subcontractors and third-party vendors to execute certain projects.\nSchuff relies on third-party suppliers, especially suppliers of steel and steel components, and subcontractors to assist in the completion of projects. To the extent these parties cannot execute their portion of the work and are unable to deliver their services, equipment or materials according to the agreed-upon contractual terms, or Schuff cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, Schuff\u2019s ability to complete a project in a timely manner may be impacted. Furthermore, when bidding or negotiating for contracts, Schuff must make estimates of the amounts these third parties will charge for their services, equipment and materials. If the amount Schuff is required to pay for third-party goods and services in an effort to meet its contractual obligations exceeds the amount it has estimated, Schuff could experience project losses or a reduction in estimated profit.\nAny increase in the price of, or change in supply and demand for, the steel and steel components that Schuff utilizes to complete projects could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe prices of the steel and steel components that Schuff utilizes in the course of completing projects are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, energy costs, transportation costs, government regulations, duties and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, general economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances. Although Schuff may attempt to pass on certain of these increased costs to its customers, it may not be able to pass all of these cost increases on to its customers. As a result, Schuff\u2019s margins may be adversely impacted by such cost increases.\nSchuff\u2019s dependence on suppliers of steel and steel components makes it vulnerable to a disruption in the supply of its products.\nSchuff purchases a majority of the steel and steel components utilized in the course of completing projects from several domestic and foreign steel producers and suppliers. Although Schuff has long-standing relationships with many of its suppliers, it generally does not have long-term contracts with them. An adverse change in any of the following could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations or financial condition:\n\u2022\nits ability to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions upon which it purchases products from its suppliers, including applicable exchange rates, transport costs and other costs, its suppliers\u2019 willingness to extend credit to it to finance its inventory purchases and other factors beyond its control;\n\u2022\nfinancial condition of its suppliers;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in the countries in which its suppliers are located;\n\u2022\nits ability to import products;\n\u2022\nits suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions and tariffs;\n\u2022\nits inability to find replacement suppliers in the event of a deterioration of the relationship with current suppliers; or\n\u2022\nits suppliers\u2019 ability to manufacture and deliver products according to its standards of quality on a timely and efficient basis.\nIntense competition in the markets Schuff serves could reduce Schuff\u2019s market share and earnings.\nThe principal geographic and product markets Schuff serves are highly competitive, and this intense competition is expected to continue. Schuff competes with other contractors for commercial, industrial and specialty projects on a local, regional, or national basis. Continued service within these markets requires substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel, and certain of Schuff\u2019s competitors have financial and operating resources greater than Schuff. Competition also places downward pressure on Schuff\u2019s contract prices and margins. Among the principal competitive factors within the industry are price, timeliness of completion of projects, quality, reputation, and the desire of customers to utilize specific contractors with whom they have favorable relationships and prior experience. While Schuff believes that it maintains a competitive advantage with respect to these factors, failure to continue to do so or to meet other competitive challenges could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSchuff\u2019s customers\u2019 ability to receive the applicable regulatory and environmental approvals for projects and the timeliness of those approvals could adversely affect Schuff\u2019s business.\nThe regulatory permitting process for Schuff\u2019s projects requires significant investments of time and money by Schuff\u2019s customers and sometimes by Schuff. There are no assurances that Schuff\u2019s customers or Schuff will obtain the necessary permits for these projects. Applications for permits may be opposed by governmental entities, individuals or special interest groups, resulting in delays and possible non-issuance of the permits.\nSchuff\u2019s failure to obtain or maintain required licenses may adversely affect its business.\nSchuff is subject to licensure and hold licenses in each of the states in the United States in which it operates and in certain local jurisdictions within such states. While we believe that Schuff is in material compliance with all contractor licensing requirements in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, the failure to obtain, loss of or revocation of any license or the limitation on any of Schuff\u2019s primary services thereunder in any jurisdiction in which it conducts substantial operations could prevent Schuff from conducting further operations in such jurisdiction and have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nVolatility in equity and credit markets could adversely impact Schuff due to its impact on the availability of funding for Schuff\u2019s customers, suppliers and subcontractors.\nSome of Schuff\u2019s ultimate customers, suppliers and subcontractors have traditionally accessed commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations, and the availability of funding from those sources could be\nadversely impacted by volatile equity or credit markets. The unavailability of financing could lead to the delay or cancellation of projects or the inability of such parties to pay Schuff or provide needed products or services and thereby have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSchuff\u2019s business may be adversely affected by bonding and letter of credit capacity.\nCertain of Schuff\u2019s projects require the support of bid and performance surety bonds or letters of credit. A restriction, reduction, or termination of Schuff\u2019s surety bond agreements or letter of credit facilities could limit its ability to bid on new project opportunities, thereby limiting new awards, or perform under existing awards.\nSchuff is vulnerable to significant fluctuations in its liquidity that may vary substantially over time.\nSchuff\u2019s operations could require the utilization of large sums of working capital, sometimes on short notice and sometimes without assurance of recovery of the expenditures. Circumstances or events that could create large cash outflows include losses resulting from fixed-price contracts, environmental liabilities, litigation risks, contract initiation or completion delays, customer payment problems, professional and product liability claims and other unexpected costs. Although Schuff\u2019s facilities provide it with a source of liquidity, there is no guarantee that such facilities will be sufficient to meet Schuff\u2019s liquidity needs or that Schuff will be able to maintain such facilities or obtain any other sources of liquidity on attractive terms, or at all.\nSchuff\u2019s projects expose it to potential professional liability, product liability, warranty and other claims.\nSchuff\u2019s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in providing engineering and construction services for the construction of often large commercial industrial facilities, such as the risk of accidents, fires and explosions. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, business interruptions, property damage and pollution and environmental damage. Schuff may be subject to claims as a result of these hazards. In addition, the failure of any of Schuff\u2019s products to conform to customer specifications could result in warranty claims against it for significant replacement or rework costs, which could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAlthough Schuff generally does not accept liability for consequential damages in its contracts, should it be determined liable, it may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed applicable policy limits. Any catastrophic occurrence in excess of insurance limits at project sites involving Schuff\u2019s products and services could result in significant professional liability, product liability, warranty or other claims against Schuff. Any damages not covered by insurance, in excess of insurance limits or, if covered by insurance, subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for Schuff, which may reduce its profits and cash available for operations. These claims could also make it difficult for Schuff to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost.\nAdditionally, customers or subcontractors that have agreed to indemnify Schuff against such losses may refuse or be unable to pay Schuff.\nSchuff may experience increased costs and decreased cash flow due to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, liability for contamination of the environment or related personal injuries.\nSchuff is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning emissions into the air, discharge into waterways, generation, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of waste materials and health and safety.\nSchuff\u2019s fabrication business often involves working around and with volatile, toxic and hazardous substances and other highly regulated pollutants, substances or wastes, for which the improper characterization, handling or disposal could constitute violations of U.S. federal, state or local laws and regulations and laws of\nother countries, and result in criminal and civil liabilities. Environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for certain pollutants or waste materials and require Schuff to obtain permits and comply with various other requirements. Governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on Schuff, or revoke or deny issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Schuff is also exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or wastes. In connection with the historical operation of our facilities, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous may have been used or disposed of at some sites in a manner that may require us to make expenditures for remediation.\nThe environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which Schuff is subject are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict the impact of such laws and regulations on Schuff in the future. We cannot ensure that Schuff\u2019s operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations will not cause Schuff to incur significant costs or adopt more costly methods of operation. Additionally, the adoption and implementation of any new regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, Schuff\u2019s customers\u2019 equipment and operations could significantly impact demand for Schuff\u2019s services, particularly among its customers for industrial facilities.\nAny expenditures in connection with compliance or remediation efforts or significant reductions in demand for Schuff\u2019s services as a result of the adoption of environmental proposals could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSchuff is and will likely continue to be involved in litigation that could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSchuff has been and may be, from time to time, named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with fabrication and other products and services Schuff provides and other matters. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business, including employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely completion of projects or other issues concerning fabrication and other products and services Schuff provides. While we do not believe that any of Schuff\u2019s pending contractual, employment-related personal injury or property damage claims and disputes will have a material effect on Schuff\u2019s future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.\nWork stoppages, union negotiations and other labor problems could adversely affect Schuff\u2019s business.\nA portion of Schuff\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of its facilities could have a material adverse effect on Schuff\u2019s business. There is inherent risk that ongoing or future negotiations relating to collective bargaining agreements or union representation may not be favorable to Schuff. From time to time, Schuff also has experienced attempts to unionize its non-union facilities. Such efforts can often disrupt or delay work and present risk of labor unrest.\nSchuff\u2019s employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.\nSafety is a primary focus of Schuff\u2019s business and is critical to all of its employees and customers, as well as its reputation. However, Schuff often works on large-scale and complex projects, frequently in geographically remote locations. Such involvement often places Schuff\u2019s employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or highly regulated materials. If Schuff or other parties fail to implement appropriate safety procedures for which they are responsible or if such procedures fail, Schuff\u2019s employees or others may suffer injuries. In addition to being subject to state and federal regulations concerning health and safety, many of Schuff\u2019s customers require that it meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of Schuff\u2019s\ncontract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, project costs and operating costs. Although Schuff has adopted important safety policies that are administered and enforced by functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures, the failure to comply with such policies, customer contracts or applicable regulations could subject Schuff to losses and liability.\nRisks Related to GMSL\nGMSL may be unable to maintain or replace its vessels as they age.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the average age of the vessels operated by GMSL was approximately 22 years. The expense of maintaining, repairing and upgrading GMSL\u2019s vessels typically increases with age, and after a period of time the cost necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable. There can be no assurance that GMSL will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of its existing vessels, or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make the expenditures necessary for these purposes. In addition, the supply of second-hand replacement vessels is relatively limited and the costs associated with acquiring a newly constructed vessel are high. In the event that GMSL was to lose the use of any of its vessels for a sustained period of time, its financial performance would be adversely affected.\nThe operation and leasing of seagoing vessels entails the possibility of marine disasters including damage or destruction of vessels due to accident, the loss of vessels due to piracy or terrorism, damage or destruction of cargo and similar events that may cause a loss of revenue from affected vessels and damage GMSL\u2019s business reputation, which may in turn lead to loss of business.\nThe operation of seagoing vessels entails certain inherent risks that may adversely affect GMSL\u2019s business and reputation, including:\n\u2022\ndamage or destruction of a vessel due to marine disaster such as a collision or grounding;\n\u2022\nthe loss of a vessel due to piracy and terrorism;\n\u2022\ncargo and property losses or damage as a result of the foregoing or less drastic causes such as human error, mechanical failure and bad weather;\n\u2022\nenvironmental accidents as a result of the foregoing; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions and delivery delays caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions.\nAny of these circumstances or events could substantially increase GMSL\u2019s operating costs, as for example, the cost of substituting or replacing a vessel, or lower its revenues by taking vessels out of operation permanently or for periods of time. The involvement of GMSL\u2019s vessels in a disaster or delays in delivery or damages or loss of cargo may harm its reputation as a safe and reliable vessel operator and cause it to lose business.\nGMSL\u2019s operations are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that result in substantial costs and other risks.\nGMSL does significant business with clients in the oil and natural gas industry, which is extensively regulated by U.S. federal, state, tribal, and local authorities, and corresponding foreign governmental authorities. Legislation and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion, raising the possibility of changes that may become more stringent and, as a result, may affect, among other things, the pricing or marketing of crude oil and natural gas production. Noncompliance with statutes and regulations and more vigorous enforcement of such statutes and regulations by regulatory agencies may lead to substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including the assessment of natural resource damages, the imposition of significant investigatory and remedial obligations, and may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations.\nLitigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact GMSL\u2019s financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation.\nGMSL\u2019s business is subject to various international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by GMSL\u2019s employees or agents could damage its reputation and lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in significant awards or settlements to plaintiffs and civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on GMSL\u2019s financial condition or results of operations, if not mitigated by its insurance coverage.\nAs a result of any ship or other incidents, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area, may be asserted or brought against various parties including GMSL. The time and attention of GMSL\u2019s management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. GMSL may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments, fines or civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined and not covered by its insurance policies.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect GMSL\u2019s operating results.\nThe exchange rates between the US dollar, the Singapore dollar and the GBP have fluctuated in recent periods and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Accordingly, any material fluctuation of the exchange rate of the GBP against the US dollar and Singapore dollar could have a negative impact on GMSL\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are risks inherent in foreign joint ventures and investments, such as adverse changes in currency values and foreign regulations.\nThe joint ventures in which GMSL has operating activities or interests that are located outside the United States are subject to certain risks related to the indirect ownership and development of, or investment in, foreign subsidiaries, including government expropriation and nationalization, adverse changes in currency values and foreign exchange controls, foreign taxes, U.S. taxes on the repatriation of funds to the United States, and other laws and regulations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on GMSL\u2019s investments, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGMSL derives a significant amount of its revenues from sales to customers in non-U.S. countries, which pose additional risks including economic, political and other uncertainties.\nGMSL\u2019s non-U.S. sales are significant in relation to consolidated sales. GMSL believes that non-U.S. sales will remain a significant percentage of its revenue. In addition, sales of its products to customers operating in foreign countries that experience political/economic instability or armed conflict could result in difficulties in delivering and installing complete seismic energy source systems within those geographic areas and receiving payment from these customers. Furthermore, restrictions under the FCPA or similar legislation in other countries, or trade embargoes or similar restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries, could limit GMSL\u2019s ability to do business in certain foreign countries. These factors could materially adversely affect GMSL\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther deterioration of economic opportunities in the Oil and Gas sector could adversely affect the financial growth of GMSL.\nThe O&G market has experienced an exceptional upheaval over the past several months with the price of oil falling dramatically and this economic weakness could continue into the foreseeable future. Oil prices can be\nvery volatile and are subject to international supply and demand, political developments, increased supply from new sources and the influence of OPEC in particular. The major operators are reviewing their overall capital spending and this trend is likely to reduce the size and number of projects carried out in the medium term as the project viability comes under greater scrutiny. Ongoing concerns about the systemic impact of lower oil prices and the continued uncertainty of possible reductions in long term capital expenditure could have a material adverse effect on the planned growth of GMSL and eventually curtail the anticipated cash flow and results from operations.\nRisks Related to our ICS Operations\nOur ICS business is substantially smaller than some of our major competitors, whose marketing and pricing decisions, and relative size advantage could adversely affect our ability to attract and to retain customers and are likely to continue to cause significant pricing pressures that could adversely affect ICS\u2019s net revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe carrier services telecommunications industry is significantly influenced by the marketing and pricing decisions of the larger business participants. ICS faces competition for its voice trading services from telecommunication services providers\u2019 traditional processes and new companies. Once telecommunication services providers have established business relationships with competitors to ICS, it could be extremely difficult to convince them to utilize our services. These competitors may be able to develop services or processes that are superior to ICS\u2019s services or processes, or that achieve greater industry acceptance.\nMany of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger networks, a broader portfolio of service offerings, greater control over network and transmission lines, stronger name recognition and customer loyalty and long-standing relationships with our target customers. As a result, our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected. Many of our competitors enjoy economies of scale that result in low cost structures for transmission and related costs that could cause significant pricing pressures within the industry. While growth through acquisitions is a possible strategy for ICS, there are no guarantees that any acquisitions will occur, nor are there any assurances that any acquisitions by ICS would improve the financial results of its business.\nAny failure of ICS\u2019s physical infrastructure, including undetected defects in technology, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce its revenue and harm its business reputation and financial results.\nICS depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. ICS must protect its infrastructure and any collocated equipment from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nphysical or electronic security breaches;\n\u2022\nfire, earthquake, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nwater damage;\n\u2022\npower loss; and\n\u2022\nterrorism, sabotage and vandalism.\nProblems at one or more of ICS\u2019s exchange delivery points, whether or not within ICS\u2019s control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. Any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to terminate voice calls or supply Internet capacity could reduce the confidence of the members and customers and could consequently impair ICS\u2019s ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both ICS\u2019s ability to generate revenues and its operating results.\nICS\u2019s positioning in the marketplace and intense domestic and international competition in these services places a significant strain on our resources, which if not managed effectively could result in operational inefficiencies and other difficulties.\nTo manage ICS\u2019s market positioning effectively, we must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and controls, invest in critical network infrastructure to expand its coverage and capacity, maintain or improve its service quality levels, purchase and utilize other transmission facilities, evolve its support and billing systems and train and manage its employee base. If we inaccurately forecast the movement of traffic onto ICS\u2019s network, we could have insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses. As we proceed with the development of our ICS business, operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer provisioning and support, billing and management information systems, product delivery and fulfillment, support, sales and marketing, administrative resources, network infrastructure, maintenance and upgrading. For instance, we may encounter delays or cost-overruns or suffer other adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required.\nIf ICS is not able to operate a cost-effective network, we may not be able to grow our ICS business successfully.\nOur ICS business\u2019 long-term success depends on our ability to design, implement, operate, manage, maintain and upgrade a reliable and cost-effective network infrastructure. In addition, we rely on third-party equipment and service vendors to expand and manage ICS\u2019s global network through which it provides its services. If we fail to generate additional traffic on ICS\u2019s network, if we experience technical or logistical impediments to the development of necessary aspects of ICS\u2019s network or the migration of traffic and customers onto ICS\u2019s network, or if we experience difficulties with third-party providers, we may not achieve desired economies of scale or otherwise be successful in growing our ICS business.\nIf we are not able to use and protect intellectual property associated with the ICS business domestically and internationally, it could have a material adverse effect on our ICS business.\nICS\u2019s ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to use intellectual property associated with the business in the United States and internationally. We are subject to the risks of claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and may need to litigate against others to protect our intellectual property rights. The telecommunications industry is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have a material effect on ICS\u2019s business, financial condition and/or operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in any such litigation.\nWe rely upon certain technology, including hardware and software, licensed from third parties to operate our ICS business. There can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently used by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or our inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated and could cause service disruption to ICS\u2019s customers. Such delays or reductions in the aggregate could harm our ICS business, and there can be no assurance that suitable alternative products would be available.\nWe also rely on indemnification provisions from third parties to protect against claims of infringement regarding such licensed technology, which indemnification could be affected by, among other things, the financial strength of the licensor. Furthermore, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where ICS does business. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property or other licensed rights could harm our ICS\u2019s business and/or its ability to compete effectively.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity Needs and Securities\nWe are a holding company and our only material assets are our equity interests in our operating subsidiaries and our other investments. As a result, our principal source of revenue and cash flow is distributions from our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries may be limited by law and by contract in making distributions to us.\nAs a holding company, our only material assets are our cash on hand, the equity interests in our subsidiaries and other investments. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $23.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the corporate level at HC2. Our principal source of revenue and cash flow is distributions from our subsidiaries. Thus, our ability to service our debt and to finance future acquisitions is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make upstream cash distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are and will be separate legal entities, and although they may be wholly-owned or controlled by us, they have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends, distributions or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us will also be subject to, among other things, restrictions that are contained in our subsidiaries\u2019 financing agreements, availability of sufficient funds and applicable state laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries generally will have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and claims of our creditors and stockholders. To the extent the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to us could be limited in any way, our ability to grow, pursue business opportunities or make acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, or otherwise fund and conduct our business, could be materially limited.\nIn order to satisfy the requirements of Section 226 of the Pensions Act of 2004 (UK), GMSL is a party to the Global Marine Pension Plan Recovery Plan, dated as of March 28, 2014 (the \u201cRecovery Plan\u201d). The Recovery Plan addresses GMSL\u2019s pension funding shortfall of approximately GBP 32 million by requiring GMSL to make certain scheduled fixed monthly contributions, certain variable annual profit-related contributions and certain variable dividend-related contributions to the pension plan. The variable dividend-related contributions require GMSL to pay cash contributions to the underfunded pension plan equal to 50% of any dividend payments made to its shareholder, which reduces the amount of cash available for GMSL to make upstream payments to us.\nThe Recovery Plan provides for the funding shortfall to be eliminated on or before June 30, 2021. However the UK plan must be valued on a triennial basis and all valuations are dependent upon the prevailing market conditions and the actuarial methods and assumptions used as well as the expected pension liabilities at the valuation date. There are various risks which could adversely affect the next valuation of the UK pension plan and consequently the obligations of GMSL to fund the plan, such as a significant adverse change in the market value of the pension plan assets, an increase in pension liabilities, longer life expectancy of plan members, a change in the discount rate or inflation rate used by the actuary or if the trustees of the plan recommend a material change to the investment strategy. Any increase in the deficit may result in a need for GMSL to increase its pension contributions which would reduce the amount of cash available for GMSL to make upstream dividend payments to us. While we expect the trustees of the pension plan to renegotiate the Recovery Plan on at least a triennial basis from March 31, 2014 or dispense with the Recovery Plan if and when the funding shortfall has been eliminated, we can make no assurances in relation to this.\nUnder the UK Pensions Act 2004, the Pensions Regulator may issue a contribution notice to us or any employer in the UK pension plan or any person who is connected with or is an associate of any such employer where the Pensions Regulator is of the opinion that the relevant person has been a party to an act, or a deliberate failure to act, which had as its main purpose (or one of its main purposes) the avoidance of pension liabilities. Under the UK Pensions Act 2008, the Pension Regulator has the power to issue a contribution notice to any such person where the Pensions Regulator is of the opinion that the relevant person has been a party to an act, or a deliberate failure to act, which has a materially detrimental effect on pension plans without sufficient mitigation having been provided. If the Pensions Regulator considers that any of the employers participating in the UK pension plan are \u201cinsufficiently resourced\u201d or a \u201cservice company,\u201d it may impose a financial support direction requiring us or any person associated or connected with that employer to put in place financial support.\nThe Pensions Regulator can only issue a contribution notice or financial support direction where it believes it is reasonable to do so. The terms \u201cassociate\u201d and \u201cconnected person,\u201d which are taken from the UK Insolvency Act 1986, are widely defined and cover among others GMSL, its subsidiaries and others deemed to be shadow directors. Liabilities imposed under a contribution notice or financial support direction may be up to the difference between the value of the assets of the plan and the cost of buying out the benefits of members and other beneficiaries. If GMSL or its connected or associated parties are the recipient of a contribution notice or financial support direction this could have an effect on our cash flow.\nIn practice, the risk of a contribution notice being imposed may restrict our ability to restructure or undertake certain corporate activities relating to GMSL without first seeking agreement of the trustees of the UK pension plan and, possibly, the approval of the Pensions Regulator. Additional security may also need to be provided to the trustees before certain corporate activities can be undertaken (such as the payment of an unusual dividend from GMSL) and any additional funding required by the UK pension plan may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations.\nIn addition, GMSL and Schuff are each party to credit agreements that include certain financial covenants that can reduce or otherwise limit the amount of cash available to make upstream dividend payments to us. GMSL\u2019s term loan with DVB Bank (the \u201cGMSL Facility\u201d) requires GMSL to maintain minimum liquidity of GBP 7.5 million through January 23, 2015, and GBP 6.0 million until maturity on July 23, 2018. If GMSL does not meet these minimum liquidity requirements, it will not be able to make upstream dividend payments to us until such minimum liquidity requirements are met. Schuff\u2019s Credit and Security Agreement (the \u201cSchuff Facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Credit, Inc. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) allows dividends to be paid to Schuff shareholders up to four times a year, subject to the following conditions: (a) the consent of Wells Fargo Credit, Inc., which is the Schuff Facility lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); (b) maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1; (c) a minimum excess availability under the Schuff Facility of $10 million before and after the payment of a dividend and (d) Schuff not being in default under the Schuff Facility at the time of the dividend payment. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nTo service our indebtedness and other obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations, including those under (a) the indenture (the \u201c11% Notes Indenture\u201d) governing our 11% senior secured notes due 2019 (the \u201c11% Notes\u201d), (b) the Schuff Facility and (c) the GMSL Facility, as well as the obligations with respect to HC2\u2019s (i) 30,000 shares of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) issued on May 29, 2014, (ii) 11,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A-1 Preferred Stock\u201d) issued on September 22, 2014, and (iii) 14,000 shares of Series A-2 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A-2 Preferred Stock\u201d and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) issued on January 5, 2015, each of which is governed by a certificate of designation forming a part of HC2\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation (collectively, the \u201cCertificates of Designation\u201d), could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and Preferred Stock and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or make mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Preferred Stock, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or redeem the Preferred Stock, on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn addition, we may not be able to affect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness or redeem the Preferred Stock will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt or financings related to the redemption of our Preferred Stock could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments or preferred stock may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness or dividend payments on our Preferred Stock would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or otherwise raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service and other obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness and Preferred Stock, including the 11% Notes Indenture, the Schuff Facility and the GMSL Facility, as well as the Certificates of Designation with respect to our Preferred Stock, contain various covenants that may limit our discretion in the operation of our business and/or require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants. The failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness and Preferred Stock, including the 11% Notes Indenture, the Schuff Facility and the GMSL Facility, as well as the Certificates of Designation with respect to the Preferred Stock, contain, and any of our other future financing agreements may contain, covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on our businesses.\nThe 11% Notes Indenture contains various covenants, including those that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur liens on our property, assets and revenue;\n\u2022\nborrow money, and guarantee or provide other support for the indebtedness of third parties;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase, our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase, certain of our indebtedness, including our Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nenter into certain change of control transactions;\n\u2022\nmake investments in entities that we do not control, including joint ventures;\n\u2022\nenter into certain asset sale transactions, including divestiture of certain company assets and divestiture of capital stock of wholly-owned subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into secured financing arrangements; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nThe Schuff Facility and the GMSL Facility contain similar covenants applicable to Schuff and GMSL, respectively. These covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses. In addition, the 11% Notes Indenture requires that we meet certain financial tests, including a collateral coverage ratio and minimum liquidity test. Our ability to satisfy these tests may be affected by factors and events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet such tests in the future.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions in the 11% Notes Indenture, or any agreement governing other indebtedness we could incur, may result in an event of default under those agreements. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which acceleration may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt. If any of these risks were to occur, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Certificates of Designation provide the holders of our Preferred Stock with consent and voting rights with respect to certain of the matters referred to above, in addition to certain corporate governance rights. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financings or to engage in other business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe have significant indebtedness and other financing arrangements and could incur additional indebtedness and other obligations, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2014, our total outstanding indebtedness was $343.4 million and the accrued value of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock was $39.9 million, and on January 5, 2015 we issued $14.0 million of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock. We may not generate enough cash flow to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness and other arrangements.\nAdditional risks relating to our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include:\n\u2022\nincreased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nhigher interest expense if interest rates increase on our floating rate borrowings and our hedging strategies are not effective to mitigate the effects of these increases;\n\u2022\nour having to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other arrangements, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing, on terms we find acceptable, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate or to take advantage of market opportunities; and \u00b7\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and other outstanding obligations.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness or enter into additional financing arrangements in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of the 11% Notes Indenture and our other financing arrangements allow us to incur additional debt and issue additional shares of preferred stock, subject to certain limitations. If additional indebtedness is incurred or equity is issued, the risks described above could intensify. In addition, our inability to maintain certain leverage ratios could result in acceleration of a portion of our debt obligations and could cause us to be in default if we are unable to repay the accelerated obligations.\nHC2 may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, which could dilute the interests of its stockholders and present other risks.\nHC2\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), authorizes the issuance of up to 80,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of February 28, 2015, HC2 has 23,815,216 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, and 55,000 shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. However, the Certificate of Incorporation authorizes HC2\u2019s Board of Directors to from time to time, subject to limitations prescribed by law and any consent rights granted to holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, to issue additional shares of preferred stock having rights that are senior to those afforded to the holders of HC2\u2019s common stock. HC2 also has reserved shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to its broad-based equity incentive plans, upon exercise of stock options and other equity-based awards granted thereunder, and pursuant to other equity compensation arrangements.\nHC2 may issue shares of common stock or additional shares of preferred stock to raise additional capital, to complete a business combination or other acquisition, to capitalize new businesses or new or existing businesses of our operating subsidiaries or pursuant to other employee incentive plans, any of which could dilute the interests of HC2\u2019s stockholders and present other risks.\nThe issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock may, among other things:\n\u2022\nsignificantly dilute the equity interest and voting power of all other stockholders;\n\u2022\nsubordinate the rights of holders of HC2\u2019s outstanding common stock and/or Preferred Stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to holders of HC2\u2019s common stock and/or Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\ncall for us to make dividend or other payments not available to the holders of HC2\u2019s common stock; and\n\u2022\ncause a change in control of our company if a substantial number of shares of HC2\u2019s common stock is issued and/or if additional shares of preferred stock having substantial voting rights are issued.\nThe issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, or perceptions in the market that such issuances could occur, may also adversely affect the prevailing market price of HC2\u2019s outstanding common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of HC2 common stock by holders of our Preferred Stock or other significant stockholders may adversely affect the market price of HC2 common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the holders of our outstanding Preferred Stock had certain rights to convert their Preferred Stock into an aggregate amount of approximately 10,192,757 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to a second amended and restated registration rights agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) entered into in connection with the issuance of the Preferred Stock, we have granted registration rights to the purchasers of our Preferred Stock and certain of their transferees with respect to HC2 common stock held by them and common stock underlying the Preferred Stock. This Registration Rights Agreement allows these holders, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares under the federal securities laws. Furthermore, the shares of HC2 common stock held by these holders, as well as other significant stockholders, may be sold into the public market under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of HC2 common stock into the public market, or perceptions in the market that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market price of HC2 common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities and other instruments on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading, or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or other instruments or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing, limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nPrice fluctuations in HC2\u2019s common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors.\nThe trading price of HC2\u2019s common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations and the performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nreaction of the market to our announcement of any future acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nactions of HC2\u2019s equity investors, including sales of HC2\u2019s common stock by significant shareholders.", "PERMNO": 84247, "SIC": 3440, "TIC": "HCHC"}
