{"cik": "1575965", "company": "Gaming & Leisure Properties, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe are significantly dependent on two tenants and their respective subsidiaries until we substantially diversify our portfolio and an event that has a material and adverse effect on either tenant\u2019s respective business, financial position or results of operations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations and we could be restrained from exercising any remedies under our Master Leases.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are based on the revenue derived under the master leases with Penn and Pinnacle. Because these master leases are triple-net leases, we depend on Penn and Pinnacle to operate the properties that we own in a manner that generates revenues sufficient to allow the tenants to meet their obligations to us, including payment of rent and all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with these leased properties and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their businesses. There can be no assurance that either Penn or Pinnacle will have sufficient assets, income or access to financing to enable them to satisfy their payment obligations under the master leases. The ability of our tenants to fulfill their obligations may depend, in part, upon the overall profitability of their operations. The inability or unwillingness of either Penn or Pinnacle to meet their subsidiaries\u2019 rent obligations and other obligations under the master leases, in each case, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders as required to maintain our status as a REIT and our financial position could be materially weakened if any of our tenants are unable to meet their obligations to us or failed to renew or extend any lease as such lease expires, or if we are unable to lease or re-lease our properties on economically favorable terms.\nDue to our dependence on rental payments from Penn and Pinnacle (and their respective subsidiaries) as our primary source of revenue, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under the master leases or to terminate the master leases with respect to any particular property. Failure by Penn or Pinnacle to comply with the terms of their respective master leases or to comply with the gaming regulations to which the leased properties are subject could require us to find another lessee for such leased property and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by either Penn or Pinnacle, as the case may be. In such event, we may be unable to locate a suitable lessee at similar rental rates or at all, which would have the effect of reducing our rental revenues.\nOur pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other REITs (including other gaming-focused REITs), investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, lenders, gaming companies (including gaming companies considering REIT structures) and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. Increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of gaming properties and other properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, the fact that we must distribute 90% of our net taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions. As a result, if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms, further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed and completing proposed acquisitions may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, fluctuations in the price of our common stock may impact our ability to finance additional acquisitions through the issuance of common stock and/or cause significant dilution.\nInvestments in and acquisitions of gaming properties and other properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments, including that the investment's performance will fail to meet expectations or that the tenant, operator or manager will underperform. Real estate development projects present other risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant development costs prior to completion of the project.\nOur pursuit of strategic acquisitions unrelated to the gaming industry may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions of properties unrelated to the gaming industry, including acquisitions that may be complementary to our existing gaming properties. Our management does not possess the same level of expertise with the dynamics and market conditions applicable to non-gaming assets, which could adversely affect the results of our expansion into other asset classes. In addition, we may be unable to achieve our desired return on our investments in new or adjacent asset classes.\nWe are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nAs the owner and landlord of gaming facilities, we are impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry. Therefore, our success is to some degree dependent on the gaming industry, which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general, changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we and our tenants have no control. As we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry, a decrease in the gaming business would likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio, particularly because a component of the rent under our leases is based, over time, on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by our tenants. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as, but not limited to, lackluster recoveries from recessions, high unemployment levels, higher income taxes, low levels of consumer confidence, weakness in the housing market, cultural and demographic changes, and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flow.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an increasing number of gaming facilities with an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from alternative wagering products, such as internet lotteries, sweepstakes, social gaming products, daily fantasy sports and other internet wagering gaming services or games of skill, which allow their customers a wagering alternative to the casino-style, in person gaming from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our TRS Properties and the business of our tenants and, indirectly, our business. Certain alternative wagering products may be illegal under federal or state law but operate exclusively in certain states or from overseas locations, and are accessible to certain domestic gamblers. Present state or federal laws that restrict the forms of gaming authorized or the number of competitors that offer gaming in the applicable jurisdiction are subject to change and may increase the competition affecting our TRS Properties and the business of our tenants and, indirectly, our business. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker and other alternative wagering products in a number of states and at the federal level. Several states, including Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, have enacted legislation authorizing intrastate internet gaming and internet gaming operations have begun in these states. Expansion of internet gaming in other jurisdictions (both legal and illegal) could further compete with our traditional operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and result of operations.\nThe operations of our TRS Properties and of our tenants in our leased facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualty events. Because many of our facilities are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, they are subject to risks in addition to those associated with land-based facilities, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions. A component of the rent under our leases is based, over time, on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by Penn, Pinnacle and Casino Queen on our properties; consequently, a casualty that leads to the loss of use of a casino facility subject to our leases for an extended period may negatively impact our revenues.\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities.\nThe ownership, operation, and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to pervasive regulation. These regulations impact both our ownership and operation of the TRS Properties and the operations of our gaming tenants. Our ownership and operation of the TRS Properties subject us and our officers, directors and shareholders to the jurisdiction of the gaming regulatory agencies in Louisiana and Maryland. Further, many gaming and racing regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which our tenants operate require GLPI, its affiliates and certain officers and directors to maintain licenses as a key business entity, supplier or key person because of GLPI's status as landlord. For GLPI to maintain such licenses in good standing, certain of GLPI's officers, directors and shareholders are also required to maintain license or finding of suitability.\nMany jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for \"institutional investors\" that hold a company's voting securities for passive investment purposes only. Some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest. Subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved, for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities.\nAdditionally, substantially all material loans, significant acquisitions, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities in advance of the transaction. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of\ncertain gaming authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise are subject to receipt of prior approval of gaming authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of GLPI or one of its subsidiaries must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent licensing standards prior to assuming control.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded portfolio of properties and any failure by us to effectively manage our portfolio could have a material and adverse effect on our business and our ability to make distributions to shareholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.\nFollowing the completion of the Pinnacle transaction, the size of our business materially increased. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose challenges for management, including challenges related to acting as landlord to a larger portfolio of properties and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful.\nRequired regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our gaming properties, which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties.\nThe tenants of our gaming properties are operators of gaming facilities and must be licensed under applicable state law. Prior to the transfer of gaming facilities, including a controlling interest, the new owner or operator generally must become licensed under state law. In the event that any current lease or any future lease agreement we enter into is terminated or expires and a new tenant is found, any delays in the new tenant receiving regulatory approvals from the applicable state government agencies, or the inability to receive such approvals, may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent.\nOur charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our outstanding stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or change of control of our company.\nIn order for us to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year after the first year for which GLPI elected to qualify to be taxed as a REIT (2014). Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own GLPI stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which GLPI elected to be taxed as a REIT). GLPI's charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes the Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve GLPI's qualification as a REIT. GLPI's charter also provides that, subject to certain exceptions approved by the Board of Directors, no person may beneficially or constructively own more than 7% in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive, of GLPI's outstanding shares of all classes and series of stock. The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of GLPI that might involve a premium price for shares of GLPI stock or otherwise be in the best interests of GLPI shareholders. The acquisition of less than 7% of our outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own beneficially or constructively in excess of 7% in value of our outstanding stock, and thus violate our charter's ownership limit. Our charter prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being \"closely held\" under Section 856(h) of the Code. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the transfer being automatically void. GLPI's charter also provides that shares of GLPI's capital stock acquired or held in excess of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and that any person who acquires shares of GLPI's capital stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the market price on the day the shares were transferred to the trust or the amount realized from the sale. GLPI or its designee will have the right to purchase the shares from the trustee at this calculated price as well. A transfer of shares of GLPI's capital stock in violation of the limit may be void under certain circumstances. GLPI's 7% ownership limitation may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of GLPI, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for GLPI's shareholders. To assist GLPI in complying with applicable gaming laws, our charter also provides that capital stock of GLPI that is owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or an affiliate of an unsuitable person will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and that any such unsuitable person or affiliate will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid by the unsuitable person or affiliate for the shares or the amount realized from the sale, in each case less a discount in a percentage (up to 100%) to be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion. The shares shall additionally be redeemable by GLPI, out of funds legally available for that redemption, to the extent required by the gaming authorities making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent determined to be necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors, at a redemption price equal to the lesser of (i) the market price on the date of the redemption notice, (ii) the market price on the\nredemption date, or (iii) the actual amount paid for the shares by the owner thereof, in each case less a discount in a percentage (up to 100%) to be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion.\nPennsylvania law and provisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent takeover attempts by third parties and therefore inhibit our shareholders from realizing a premium on their stock.\nOur charter and bylaws, in addition to Pennsylvania law, contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. Our charter and bylaws, among other things (i) permit the Board of Directors, without further action of the shareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock; (ii) establish certain advance notice procedures for shareholder proposals, and require all director candidates to be recommended by the nominating committee of the Board of Directors following the affirmative determination by the nominating committee that such nominee is likely to meet the applicable suitability requirements of any federal, state or local regulatory body having jurisdiction over us; (iii) provide that a director may only be removed by shareholders for cause and upon the vote of 75% of the shares entitled to vote; (iv) do not permit direct nomination by shareholders of nominees for election to the Board of Directors, but instead permit shareholders to recommend potential nominees to our Compensation and Governance Committee; (v) require shareholders to have beneficially owned at least 1% of our outstanding common stock in order to recommend a person for nomination for election to the Board of Directors, or to present a shareholder proposal, for action at a shareholders meeting; and (vi) provide for supermajority approval requirements for amending or repealing certain provisions in our charter and in order to approve an amendment or repeal of any provision of our bylaws that has not been proposed by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, specific anti-takeover provisions in Pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions require (i) approval of certain transactions by a majority of the voting stock other than that held by the potential acquirer; (ii) the acquisition at \"fair value\" of all the outstanding shares not held by an acquirer of 20% or more; (iii) a five-year moratorium on certain \"business combination\" transactions with an \"interested shareholder;\" (iv) the loss by interested shareholders of their voting rights over \"control shares;\" (v) the disgorgement of profits realized by an interested shareholder from certain dispositions of our shares; and (vi) severance payments for certain employees and prohibiting termination of certain labor contracts.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make GLPI immune from takeovers or to prevent a transaction from occurring. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of GLPI. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nOur success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team, particularly Peter M. Carlino, our chief executive officer, and William J. Clifford, our chief financial officer. If we lose the services of Messrs. Carlino or Clifford, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Furthermore, the Company does not have any employment agreements in place with the members of its executive management team.\nWe may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense.\nWhile our leases require, and new lease agreements are expected to require, that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants, a tenant's failure to comply could lead to an uninsured or underinsured loss and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover such uninsured or underinsured amounts from such tenant. Further, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property.\nIf we or one of our tenants experience a loss that is uninsured, or that exceeds our or our tenant's policy coverage limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those\nproperties. In addition, if the damaged properties were subject to recourse indebtedness, we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if these properties were irreparably damaged.\nIn addition, even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance, a disruption of our or our tenant's business caused by a casualty event may result in the loss of business or tenants. The business interruption insurance we or our tenant's carry may not fully compensate us for the loss of business or tenants due to an interruption caused by a casualty event.\nA disruption in the financial markets may make it more difficult to evaluate the stability, net assets and capitalization of insurance companies and any insurer's ability to meet its claim payment obligations. A failure of an insurance company to make payments to us upon an event of loss covered by an insurance policy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment if the market price of our common stock declines.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and shareholders may not be able to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they acquired the common stock due to fluctuations in its market price, including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to our performance or prospects.\nSpecific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for our common stock include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock or other comparable REITs;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue stream or future prospects;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions taken by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour failure to close pending acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour failure to achieve the perceived benefits of our acquisitions, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and operations or the gaming industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax or accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the financial markets or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events; and\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by former Pinnacle shareholders, members of our management team or other significant shareholders.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.\nAs an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we will not operate or manage most of our property, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release.\nIn addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property's value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination.\nAlthough we intend to require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, including environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the\ntenant or operator to indemnify us. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Status as a REIT\nIf we do not qualify to be taxed as a REIT, or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe elected on our 2014 U.S. federal income tax return to be treated as a REIT and intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. We currently operate, and intend to continue to operate, in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We received an opinion from our special tax advisors, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and KPMG LLP (collectively the \"Special Tax Advisors\"), with respect to our qualification as a REIT in connection with the Spin-Off. Investors should be aware, however, that opinions of advisors are not binding on the IRS or any court. The opinions of the Special Tax Advisors represent only the view of the Special Tax Advisors based on their review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us, including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income. The opinions are expressed as of the date issued. The Special Tax Advisors have no obligation to advise us or the holders of our common stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed or of any subsequent change in applicable law. Furthermore, both the validity of the opinions of Special Tax Advisors and our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis, the results of which will not be monitored by the Special Tax Advisors. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.\nPenn has received a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to certain issues relevant to our qualification as a REIT. In general, the ruling provides, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, that (1) certain of the assets to be held by us after the Spin-Off and (2) the methodology for calculating a certain portion of rent received by us pursuant to the Penn Master Lease will not adversely affect our qualification as a REIT. Although we may generally rely upon the ruling, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge our qualification as a REIT on the basis of other issues or facts outside the scope of the ruling.\nIf we were to fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nQualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT depends on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify to be taxed as a REIT may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence.\nWe could fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT if income we receive from Penn or Pinnacle, or their subsidiaries, is not treated as qualifying income.\nUnder applicable provisions of the Code, we will not be treated as a REIT unless we satisfy various requirements, including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income. Rents received or accrued by us from Penn or Pinnacle, or their subsidiaries, will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the Penn Master Lease or Pinnacle Master Lease is not respected as a true lease for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is instead treated as a service contract, joint venture or some other type of arrangement. If the Penn Master Lease or Pinnacle Master Lease is not respected as a true lease for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. Furthermore, our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.\nIn addition, subject to certain exceptions, rents received or accrued by us from Penn or Pinnacle, or their subsidiaries, will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if we or an actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Penn stock or Pinnacle stock entitled to vote or 10% or more of the total value of all classes of Penn stock or Pinnacle stock. Our charter provides for restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock, including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from Penn or Pinnacle, or their subsidiaries, to be treated as non-qualifying rent for purposes of the REIT gross income requirements. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by us from Penn or Pinnacle, or their subsidiaries, will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of REIT qualification requirements.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to income from \"qualified dividends\" payable by U.S. corporations to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is currently 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts or estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our stock.\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, in order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT (assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied) so that U.S. federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a REIT but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code.\nFrom time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our stock. Restrictions on our indebtedness, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make certain distributions, could preclude us from meeting the 90% distribution requirement. Decreases in funds from operations due to unfinanced expenditures for acquisitions of properties or increases in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding without commensurate increases in funds from operations each would adversely affect our ability to maintain distributions to our shareholders. Moreover, the failure of Penn or Pinnacle to make rental payments under the Penn Master Lease, the Pinnacle Master Lease or the Meadows Lease, as applicable, would materially impair our ability to make distributions. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will be able to make distributions at the anticipated distribution rate or any other rate.\nEven if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\nEven if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. For example, we hold certain of our assets and conduct related activities through TRS subsidiary corporations that are subject to federal, state, and local corporate-level income taxes as regular C corporations as well as state and local gaming taxes. In addition, we may incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities and \"real estate assets\" (as defined in the Code), including certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of our investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our shareholders.\nIn addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as a REIT we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the amounts we distribute to shareholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. Income from certain hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy the REIT gross income tests (including gain from the termination of such a transaction) does not constitute \"gross income\" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests that apply to REITs, provided that certain identification requirements are met. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge, the income is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the TRS may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in the TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income in the TRS.\nWe paid the Purging Distribution in common stock and cash and may pay taxable dividends on our common stock in common stock and cash. Our shareholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nWe paid the Purging Distribution in a combination of cash and GLPI stock. Penn has received a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to certain issues relevant to our payment of the Purging Distribution in a combination of cash and GLPI stock. In general, the ruling provides, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, that (1) the Purging Distribution will be treated as a dividend that will first reduce our accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) attributable to pre-REIT years in satisfaction of the REIT annual distribution requirement and (2) the amount of any GLPI stock received by any GLPI shareholder as part of the Purging Distribution will be considered to equal the amount of cash that could have been received instead. In connection with the Purging Distribution, a shareholder of our common stock was required to report dividend income as a result of the Purging Distribution even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such shareholder.\nWe currently intend to pay dividends (other than the Purging Distribution) in cash only, and not in-kind. However, if for any taxable year, we have significant amounts of taxable income in excess of available cash flow, we may declare dividends in-kind in order to satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirements. We may distribute a portion of our dividends in the form of our stock or our debt instruments. In either event, a shareholder of GLPI common stock will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such shareholder.\nThe IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs (and, with respect to the Purging Distribution and as described above, to Penn) treating certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock as taxable dividends that would satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Those rulings may be relied upon only by taxpayers to whom they were issued, but we could request a similar ruling from the IRS. We cannot rely on the private letter ruling Penn received from the IRS, as described above, with respect to the payment of dividends other than the Purging Distribution. In addition, the IRS previously issued a revenue procedure authorizing publicly traded REITs to make elective cash/stock dividends, but that revenue procedure does not apply to our taxable year beginning on January 1, 2014 and future taxable years. Accordingly, it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends (other than the Purging Distribution) payable in-kind.\nIf we make any taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, shareholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the GLPI stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in GLPI stock. If, in any taxable dividend payable in cash and GLPI stock, a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may be viewed as economically equivalent to a dividend reduction and put downward pressure on the market price of our stock.\nWe could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held before electing to be treated as a REIT and in the assets acquired from Pinnacle.\nWe own appreciated assets that were held by a C corporation before we elected to be treated as a REIT and were acquired in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our ownership is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the C corporation. If we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the five-year period following our acquisition of the assets from the C corporation (i.e., during the five-year period following our qualification as a REIT), we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain from such assets to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the assets on the date that they were acquired by us (i.e., at the time that we became a REIT) over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date, which are referred to as built-in gains. The assets acquired from Pinnacle are expected to have significant built-in-gains. Because, prior to the Merger, Pinnacle was a C corporation, if we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the five-year period following the Merger, we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain from such assets to the extent of the built-in-gain in such assets at the time of the Merger.\nWe would be subject to this tax liability even if we continue to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Any recognized built-in gain will retain our character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining REIT taxable income and our distribution requirement. Any tax on the recognized built-in gain will reduce REIT taxable income. We may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the five-year period in which the built-in gain tax applies in order to avoid the built-in gain tax. However, there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur. If we sell such assets in a taxable transaction, the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net built-in gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we became a REIT. The amount of tax could be significant.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had indebtedness of $4.72 billion, with an additional $534.1 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness or to finance newly-acquired properties. Any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels and/or borrowing costs. Increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to acquire properties, finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our leverage, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time (if any). If financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to develop new or enhance our existing\nproperties, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incurred additional indebtedness in connection with the Pinnacle transaction.\nOur increased indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\na material portion of our cash flows will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, including indebtedness it may incur in the future, and will not be available for other purposes, including to pay dividends and make acquisitions;\n\u2022\nit could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nit could make us more vulnerable to downturns in general economic or industry conditions or in our business, or prevent us from carrying out activities that are important to our growth;\n\u2022\nit could increase our interest expense if interest rates in general increase because our indebtedness under the senior unsecured credit facility bears interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nit could limit our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nit could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including under the notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including any financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes or under the agreements governing our other indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility and under the notes.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available under our senior unsecured credit facility or from other debt financing, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets or seeking to raise additional capital, including by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service requirements, including the inability to service the notes, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the notes.\nWe may be subject to significant dilution caused by the additional issuance of equity securities.\nIf and when additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, including under our \"at the market\" offering program (the \"ATM Offering\") and in connection with future acquisitions, our shareholders may experience significant dilution. Additionally, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, may make it more difficult for our shareholders to sell their GLPI common stock at a time and price that they deem appropriate and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nAdverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.\nOur outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings are based upon our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to both our industry and the economic outlook. Our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we\ncan access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth, the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade may have a negative effect on our future growth.\nIf we cannot obtain additional capital, our growth may be limited.\nAs described above, in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT each year, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our shareholders. As a result, our retained earnings available to fund acquisitions, development, or other capital expenditures are nominal, and we rely upon the availability of additional debt or equity capital to fund these activities. Our long-term ability to grow through acquisitions or development, which is an important component of our strategy, will be limited if we cannot obtain additional debt financing or raise equity capital. Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain debt financing or raise equity capital, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain such capital on favorable terms.\nAn increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt and could adversely affect our stock price.\nIf interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt and our variable rate debt obligations. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition more costly, as well as lower our current period earnings. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the access third parties have to credit, thereby decreasing the amount they are willing to pay for our assets and consequently limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nFurther, the dividend yield on our common stock, as a percentage of the price of such common stock, will influence the price of such common stock. Thus, an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or default could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants, including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on our assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. Specifically, our debt agreements contain the following financial covenants: a maximum total debt to total asset value ratio of 60% (subject to increase to 65% for specified periods in connection with certain acquisitions), a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1, a maximum senior secured debt to total asset value ratio of 40% and a maximum unsecured debt to unencumbered asset value ratio of 60%. These restrictions may limit our operational flexibility. Covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Spin-Off from Penn and the Acquisition of Pinnacle's Gaming Properties\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nAs a publicly traded company independent from Penn, we have the ability to pursue transactions with other gaming operators that would not pursue transactions with Penn as a current competitor and will have the ability to fund acquisitions with our equity on significantly more favorable terms than those that would be available to Penn, to diversify into different businesses in which Penn, as a practical matter, could not diversify, such as hotels, entertainment facilities and office space, and to pursue certain transactions that Penn otherwise would be disadvantaged by or precluded from pursuing due to regulatory constraints. However, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a company independent from Penn in the time we expect, if at all.\nIf the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, GLPI could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, GLPI could be required to indemnify Penn for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement.\nPenn has received a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Spin-Off, together with the required compliance exchanges and certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code (the \"IRS Ruling\"). The IRS Ruling does not address certain requirements for tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off under Section 355, and Penn received from its tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that, with respect to such requirements on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements have been satisfied. The IRS Ruling, and the tax opinions that Penn received from its tax advisors, relied on,\namong other things, certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of GLPI's business, and the IRS Ruling and the opinions would not be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect.\nNotwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine the Spin-Off should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS Ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\nUnder a Tax Matters Agreement that GLPI entered into with Penn, GLPI generally is required to indemnify Penn against any tax resulting from the Spin-Off to the extent that such tax resulted from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of GLPI, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) other actions or failures to act by GLPI, or (iii) any of GLPI's representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated. GLPI's indemnification obligations to Penn and its subsidiaries, officers and directors will not be limited by any maximum amount. If GLPI is required to indemnify Penn or such other persons under the circumstance set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, GLPI may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nThe historical financial information included in this filing may not be a reliable indicator of future results.\nThe historical financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 included herein reflect a partial year of operations following the Pinnacle acquisition which closed on April 28, 2016. In addition, the historical financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included herein reflect a full year of operations for the real estate entity and the businesses in the TRS, whereas financial results for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect a full year of operations for the businesses in the TRS and a partial year from November 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 for the real estate entity. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in Item 6 reflect only the operations of the TRS Properties. The historical financial statements included herein do not reflect what the business, financial position or results of operations of GLPI may be in the future.\nThe ownership by our executive officers and directors of common shares, options or other equity awards of Penn may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Penn, substantially all of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and certain directors own common shares of Penn, options to purchase common shares of Penn or other Penn equity awards as well as common shares, options to purchase common shares and/or other equity awards in GLPI. The individual holdings of common shares, options to purchase common shares or other equity awards of Penn and GLPI may be significant for some of these persons compared to their total assets. These equity interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could benefit or affect the equity holders of Penn in ways that do not benefit or affect us in the same manner.\nPeter M. Carlino, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David A. Handler, one of our independent directors, also serve on the Penn Board of Directors which may create conflicts of interest and/or create regulatory obstacles for the Company in its pursuit of additional properties.\nPeter M. Carlino serves as non-executive Chairman of the Board of Penn and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GLPI. In addition, David A. Handler, one of our directors, serves as a director at Penn. These overlapping positions could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or Penn's management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as greenfield development opportunities, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and Penn. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the negotiation or the resolution of any dispute between us and Penn (or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship (e.g. Penn Master Lease) thereafter. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and Penn enter into any commercial arrangements with each other in the future. We have established a mechanism in our Corporate Governance Guidelines to address potential conflicts through the use of an independent director but there can be no assurance that this process will completely eliminate conflicts resulting from overlapping directors. In addition to potential conflicts of interest, the overlapping director position could create obstacles to engaging in certain transactions in close proximity to existing Penn properties and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to overcome such obstacles.\nPotential indemnification liabilities of GLPI pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement could materially adversely affect GLPI.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement between GLPI and Penn provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, certain conditions to the separation and provisions governing the relationship between GLPI and Penn with respect to, and resulting from the separation.\nAmong other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may result relating to or arising out of our business. If GLPI is required to indemnify Penn under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, GLPI may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nEach of Penn and Pinnacle have contractual obligations to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Penn's or Pinnacle\u2019s ability, as applicable, to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nEach of Penn and Pinnacle have contractual obligations to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Penn and Pinnacle agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that Penn or Pinnacle, as applicable, will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Penn or Pinnacle, as applicable, any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from Penn or Pinnacle, as applicable, and such recovery could have a material adverse impact on Penn's or Pinnacle\u2019s financial condition and ability to pay rent due under the Penn Master Lease or the Pinnacle Master Lease, as applicable.\nA court could deem the distribution to be a fraudulent conveyance and void the transaction or impose substantial liabilities upon us.\nA court could deem the distribution of GLPI common shares or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by Penn in connection with the Spin-Off, or the Purging Distribution by GLPI, to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. In such circumstances, a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require our shareholders to return to Penn some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution, to return some of the Purging Distribution to GLPI, or require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transactions for the benefit of creditors. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied.\nThe Spin-Off agreements are not the result of negotiations between unrelated third parties.\nThe agreements that we entered into with Penn in connection with the Spin-Off, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Penn Master Lease, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement, were negotiated in the context of the Spin-Off while we were still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of Penn. As a result, although those agreements are generally intended to reflect arm's-length terms, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the terms of these agreements will be as favorable for GLPI as would have resulted from negotiations with one or more unrelated third parties.", "PERMNO": 14252, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "GLPI"}
