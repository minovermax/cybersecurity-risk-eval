RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Concerning the Steel Industry\nWorldwide overcapacity and excess supply in the steel industry can negatively affect the profitability of steel producers, including U. S. Steel.\nThe steel industry has historically been characterized by excess global capacity and supply, which have led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic recession. There has also been a pattern of worldwide capacity increases, which have been in excess of the growth in demand of steel products during periods when steel markets are stronger.\nOver the last several years, steel consumption in China and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace. Steel companies have responded by rapidly increasing steel production capability in those countries, and according to a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, global overcapacity will surpass 600 million metric tons in 2015. Steel production capability, especially in China, now appears to be well in excess of home market demand. China is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin, with approximately 50 percent of the global steel capacity. Any excess Chinese supply could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices as excess and subsidized production is exported to other markets. Since the Chinese steel industry is largely government owned, it is not subject to traditional market forces, nor subject to the scrutiny of market oversight. China has not been as adversely impacted by the ongoing difficult economic conditions, and production and sales decisions can be made for non-market reasons.\nImports of tubular products into the United States have continued to increase over the past several years. As foreign and other domestic producers increase their capacity and the availability of tubular products through importation and the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the United States, supply of certain energy related tubular products to the domestic markets we serve will increase and may adversely affect our market share, profit margins, operating results and financial position.\nU. S. Steel continues to aggressively confront any pattern or practice of unfair trade in our market, from initiating trade cases to promoting new legislation to strengthen U.S. trade laws and enforcement.\nThe steel industry is highly cyclical, which can have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSteel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with our steel production and customer product demand. U. S. Steel has implemented strategic initiatives under the Carnegie Way transformation to create an environment of sustainability during periods of economic and market downturns, but this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations.\nWe face increased competition from alternative materials, which can impact the demand for steel and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nAs a result of increasingly stringent regulatory requirements, designers, engineers and industrial manufacturers, especially those in the automotive industry, are increasing their use of lighter weight and alternative materials, such as aluminum, composites, plastics, and carbon fiber in their products. Increased government incentives and requirements for the use of such materials to meet regulatory requirements could reduce the demand for steel products, which could potentially reduce our profitability and cash flows.\nWe have been and continue to be adversely affected by violations of international trade laws, which can negatively affect steel prices and demand levels and reduce our profitability.\nImports into the United States, Canada and the EU have often violated the international trade laws of these jurisdictions. While in some cases, U. S. Steel and others have been successful in obtaining relief under these laws, in other circumstances, relief has been denied. When received, such relief is generally subject to automatic or discretionary review, rescission or reduction. There can be no assurance that any such relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief as obtained will be adequate. Since the Department of Commerce is a cabinet level department and the ITC is headed by Commissioners nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, there may be political factors that reduce the level of protection against violation of international trade laws. There is also a risk that\ninternational bodies such as the World Trade Organization or judicial bodies in the United States, Canada or the EU may change their interpretations of these laws in ways unfavorable to U. S. Steel.\nSteel sheet imports to the United States accounted for an estimated 22 percent of the U.S. steel sheet market in 2014, 15 percent in 2013 and 14 percent in 2012. Imports of energy related tubular products to the United States remain at high levels and accounted for an estimated 52 percent of the U.S. tubular market in 2014, 49 percent in 2013 and 52 percent in 2012. Non-U.S. competitors may have lower labor costs, and some are owned, controlled or subsidized by their governments, which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions.\nImports of flat-rolled steel to Canada accounted for an estimated 36 percent of the Canadian market for flat-rolled steel products in 2014, 35 percent in 2013 and 34 percent in 2012.\nTotal imports of flat-rolled carbon steel products to the 28 countries currently comprising the EU were 16 percent of the EU market in 2014, 14 percent in 2013 and 13 percent in 2012.\nIncreases in future levels of imported steel to North America and Europe could reduce future market prices and demand levels for steel products produced in those markets.\nLimited availability of raw materials and energy can constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nU. S. Steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to delays, defaults, or force majeure events by suppliers, shortages or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, ore vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties. USSE purchases substantially all of its iron ore and coking coal requirements from outside sources. USSE is also dependent upon availability of natural gas produced in Russia and transported through Ukraine. Any curtailments and escalated costs may further reduce profit margins.\nU. S. Steel and its subsidiaries can be affected by challenging economic or political conditions.\nCivil unrest and armed conflict in the Ukraine may impact USSE. In response to the ongoing armed conflict in the Ukraine, the EU and the U.S. have adopted sanctions against certain individuals and entities, including certain Russian state owned entities. These sanctions limit USSE's ability to transact with certain parties, and the conflict and sanctions could cause supply disruptions that result in production curtailments. Escalations of the conflict could also dampen regional economic growth and USSE customer activity.\nEnvironmental compliance and remediation can result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs.\nSteel producers in the United States, along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Steel producers in the EU are subject to similar laws. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Environmental laws and regulations, particularly the CAA, could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs.\nInternational environmental requirements vary. While standards in the EU, Canada and Japan are generally comparable to U.S. standards, other nations, particularly China, have substantially lesser requirements that give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage.\nGHG policies can negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that creates CO2. This distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini-mills and many other industries where CO2 generation is generally linked to energy usage. In the United States, the EPA has published rules regulating GHG emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements. The California Cap on GHG emissions and Market-Based Compliance Mechanisms Regulation and the Regulation for the Mandatory Reporting of GHG Emissions were adopted by the California Air Resources Board in October of 2011, and went into effect January 1, 2012. In a previous Congressional session, legislation regulating CO2 emissions was passed in the House of Representatives and introduced in the Senate. We do not know what action, if any, may be taken by the current or future sessions of\nCongress. The EU has also established GHG regulations. For a discussion of these, see \u201cPart I - Business - Environmental Matters.\u201d We cannot predict the final requirements that may be adopted in the United States, or the form of future actions that may be taken by the EU; however, such actions could entail substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems. This could have a negative effect on results of our operations and cash flows. Since mini-mill production does not involve the same chemical reactions as integrated production, mini-mills may have a competitive advantage. Additionally, since China and many other developing nations have not instituted GHG regulations, and since past international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol provided exemptions and lesser standards for developing nations, we may be at a competitive disadvantage with certain foreign steel producers. Many of our customers in the United States, Canada and Europe may experience similar impacts, which could result in decreased demand and lower prices for our products.\nRisk Factors Concerning U. S. Steel Legacy Obligations\nOur retiree health care and retiree life insurance plan costs, and our pension plan costs in the U. S. are higher than those of many of our competitors. These plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit pension plans covering many of our domestic employees and former employees upon their retirement. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 110,000 current employees, retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and/or healthcare and life insurance benefits. At December 31, 2014, on an accounting basis, U. S. Steel\u2019s retiree medical and life insurance plans were underfunded by approximately $0.6 billion and our pension plans were underfunded by approximately $1.0 billion.\nMost of the benefits provided to our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements and will be subject to future negotiations. About two thirds of our costs for the domestic USW participants\u2019 retiree health benefits in the Company\u2019s main domestic other benefit plan are limited to a per capita dollar maximum calculation based on 2006 base year actual costs incurred under the main U. S. Steel benefit plan for USW participants (cost cap). The Company should begin to realize the full benefit of the cost cap after 2015. If the cost cap was not in place, our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our other benefit plans could increase by $1.5 billion.\nMinimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans (other than contributions to the Steelworkers Pension Trust (SPT) described below) are regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).\nAssets held by the trusts for our pension plan and our trust for retiree health care and life insurance benefits are subject to the risks, uncertainties and variability of the financial markets. Additionally, certain corporate bond rates are utilized in determining the discount rate used to measure our pension and other benefit obligations for both U.S. GAAP and funding purposes. Companies which offer defined benefit pension plans such as U. S. Steel are exposed to interest rate risk. The Federal Reserve Board has continued to suppress interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the broader American economy, which has had the direct effect of lowering the bond rates used in the determination of the appropriate discount rate to measure U. S. Steel's pension liability. Interest rates remain well below levels seen before the 2009 recession which will have the effect of increasing U. S. Steel's pension liabilities and at the same time reducing fixed income asset returns.\nThe level of cash funding for our defined benefit pension plans in future years depends upon various factors including voluntary contributions that we may make, future pension plan asset performance, actual interest rates under the law, and the impacts of business acquisitions or divestitures, union negotiated benefit changes and future government regulations, many of which are not within our control.\nU. S. Steel contributes domestically to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan, the SPT, for USW-represented employees formerly employed by National Steel and represented employees hired after May 2003. We have legal requirements for future funding of this plan should the SPT become significantly underfunded or we decide to withdraw from the plan. Either of these scenarios may negatively impact our future cash flows. The 2012 Labor Agreements with the USW require a contribution rate of $2.65 per hour for most steelworker employees. Collectively bargained company contributions to the plan could increase as a result of future changes agreed to by the Company and the USW.\nDomestic health care costs are expected to increase in future years due to the ever rising cost of medical products and services, which is attributable to medical and pharmacological advances as well as the increased cost of compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, the overall impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 on the costs of large employer medical plans remain uncertain and subject to change. These may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Benefit obligations under our plans are not tied to operating rates or financial results; therefore, our costs do not change to reflect general economic conditions.\nMany domestic and international competitors do not provide retiree health care and life insurance or defined benefit pension plans to their employees. Many other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored retirement and health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage.\nWe have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors. This can create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of U. S. Steel\u2019s facilities were in operation before 1900. Although management believes that U. S. Steel\u2019s environmental practices have either led the industry or at least been consistent with prevailing industry practices, hazardous materials may have been released at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties. This means U. S. Steel is responsible for remediation costs associated with the disposal of such materials and many of our competitors do not have similar historical liabilities.\nU. S. Steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities, facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by U. S. Steel was deposited. In addition, there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation. For example, we recorded a charge of $32 million in 2013 related to the St. Louis Estuary and Upland project in Duluth, Minnesota.\nEnvironmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours. Many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate. Many U.S. competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do, resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation. Competitors that have obtained relief under bankruptcy laws have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to their bankruptcy filings.\nWe may be unable to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations and planned projects such as those needed for our iron ore mining operations or our electric arc furnace. We can also face permit and approval requirements that delay or otherwise adversely affect our operations and planned projects. Any such delays or failures can impact our steel production, cash flows, and profitability.\nBefore we can begin construction of new facilities, start mining or expand our mining operations into certain areas, we must obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies. The requirements to meet the regulatory authorities\u2019 standards may be costly and time-consuming and may delay planned capital projects or commencement of operations at our various production facilities.\nOther Risk Factors Applicable to U. S. Steel\nUnplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions can reduce our results of operations.\nOur steel production depends on the operation of critical structures and pieces of equipment, such as blast furnaces, casters, hot strip mills and various structures and operations that support them. While we are implementing a reliability centered maintenance initiative focusing on proactive maintenance of key machinery and equipment at our production facilities, it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production and increased maintenance and repair costs due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers.\nIt is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages, explosions, fires, floods, accidents and severe weather conditions. We are also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected.\nWe can be adversely impacted by volatility in prices for raw materials, energy, and steel.\nIn 2014, approximately 68 percent of U. S. Steel\u2019s Flat-rolled segment sales in the United States are based on sales contracts with volume commitments and durations of at least one quarter, while lesser percentages of Tubular and USSE segment sales are made pursuant to such contracts. These contracts generally have a fixed price or a price that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index and do not always have firm volume commitments. During periods of rapid escalation of raw materials, energy and other costs, U. S. Steel may not be able to recover these cost increases from customers with existing fixed price agreements. In the case of variably priced contracts which change with an index, U. S. Steel will not be able to immediately recover these cost increases. Conversely, some purchase contracts require annual commitments, or we may elect to make multi-year commitments, and in periods of unanticipated rapid demand decline, U. S. Steel may be faced with having agreed to purchase raw materials and energy at prices that are above the then current market price or in greater volumes than required. Additionally, recent decreases in iron ore, natural gas and oil prices have placed downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, our profit margins on market-based indexed contracts and spot business will be reduced.\nChanges in the global economic environment, including recent decreases in hydrocarbon prices, can lead to declines in the production levels of our major customers.\nWe sell to the automotive, service center, converter, energy and appliance and construction-related industries. Low demand from customers in these key markets may adversely impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks concerning innovation, new technologies, products and increasing customer requirements.\nTechnologies such as direct iron reduction, EAF production, oxygen-coal injection and experimental technologies such as molten oxide electrolysis and hydrogen flash smelting may be more cost effective than our current production methods. However, we may not have sufficient capital to invest in such technologies and may, from time to time, incur cost over-runs and difficulties adapting and fully integrating these technologies into our existing operations. We may also encounter control or production restrictions, or not realize the cost benefit from such capital intensive technology adaptations to our current production processes. Customers such as the automotive industry are demanding stronger and lighter products. Tubular customers are increasingly requesting pipe producers to supply connections and other ancillary parts as well as inspection and other services. We may not be successful in meeting these technological challenges and there may be increased liability exposures connected with the supply of additional products and services.\nProduct liability claims can have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nEvents such as well failures, line pipe leaks, blowouts, bursts, fires and product recalls could result in claims that our products or services were defective and caused death, personal injury, property damage or environmental pollution. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate, available to protect us in the event of a claim, or its coverage may be limited, canceled or otherwise terminated, or the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on our enterprise value after a loss.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain provisions that can limit our flexibility or impact our liquidity.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on a majority of our domestic inventory and certain of our accounts receivable and includes a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that applies to the most recent four consecutive quarters when availability under the Amended Credit Agreement is less than the greater of 10% of the total aggregate commitments and $87.5 million. The value or levels of inventory may decrease or we may not be able to meet this covenant in the future, and either or both of these situations would limit our ability to borrow under the Amended Credit Agreement. We have granted the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement a secured position in our most liquid assets, which may be a detriment to other creditors.\nWe also have a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA) that provides liquidity depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables. Reductions in eligible accounts receivable would reduce the amount of receivables available for sale.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement, $2.6 billion of our Senior Notes, and our 2019 Senior Convertible Notes also contain covenants limiting our ability to create liens and engage in sale-leasebacks. Additionally, the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and repurchase of the Senior Convertible Notes and Senior Notes\nis required upon a change of control under specified circumstances, as well as other customary provisions. The Amended Credit Agreement, the Senior Convertible Notes and the RPA have provisions that certain defaults under a material debt obligation could cause a default under the Amended Credit Agreement or the Senior Convertible Notes or termination of the RPA. These terms may affect our liquidity, our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities.\nThe \u20ac200 million revolving credit facility agreement (the Credit Agreement) contains certain USSK financial covenants (as further defined in the Credit Agreement), including maximum Leverage, maximum Net Debt to Tangible Net Worth, and minimum Interest Cover ratios. The covenants are measured semi-annually for the period covering the last twelve calendar months. USSK may not draw on the Credit Agreement if it does not comply with any of the financial covenants until the next measurement date. Failure to meet any of the financial covenants at any measurement date shall not be considered an event of default if at that measurement date, no loan was outstanding.\nAt December 31, 2014, in the event of a change in control of U. S. Steel, holders of U. S. Steel debt obligations totaling approximately $2.9 billion, which includes the Senior Notes and the Senior Convertible Notes, may require U. S. Steel to repurchase such obligations in whole or in part for cash at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In such an event, U. S. Steel may also be required to either repurchase the leased Fairfield caster for $36 million, or provide a letter of credit to secure the remaining obligation.\nThe CCAA filing by USSC on September 16, 2014 is an event of default under the terms of the Province Note loan agreement between USSC and the Province of Ontario. The failure of USSC to pay the Province Note would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the 2019 Senior Convertible Notes that enables the holders of the 2019 Senior Convertible Notes to declare them immediately due and payable.\nWe face substantial debt maturities.\nOver the next six years, we have approximately $2.1 billion of debt maturing (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We may not be able to refinance this debt or we may be forced to do so on terms substantially less favorable to U. S. Steel than our currently outstanding debt. We may be forced to delay or not make capital expenditures, which may adversely affect our competitive position and financial results.\nRating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings, which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs.\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities.\n\u201cChange in control\u201d clauses in our financial and labor agreements grant the other parties to those agreements rights to accelerate obligations and to terminate or extend our labor agreements.\nUpon the occurrence of \u201cchange in control\u201d events specified in our Senior Notes, Amended Credit Agreement, Senior Convertible Notes and various other contracts and leases, the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately repurchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms. Additionally, the 2012 Labor Agreements give the USW the right to either terminate the collective bargaining agreement or extend it for an additional three years. Among other things, these provisions may make a takeover of U. S. Steel more difficult.\nA \u201cchange of control\u201d is generally defined to include any of the following: (a) the acquisition by a person or group of at least 35 percent of our common stock, (b) a merger in which holders of our common stock own less than a majority of the equity in the resulting entity, or (c) replacement of a majority of the members of our Board of Directors by persons who were not nominated by our current directors.\nOur operations expose us to uncertainties and risks in the countries in which we operate, which can negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to economic conditions, including credit and capital market conditions, and political factors in the United States, which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, taxation, inflation, increased regulation, limitations on exports of energy and raw materials, and trade remedies. Actions taken by the U.S. government could affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nUSSK, located in Slovakia, constitutes approximately 20 percent of our global raw steel production capability. USSK is subject to economic conditions and political factors associated with the EU and the euro currency. Changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, government instability, civil unrest, increased regulation and quotas, tariffs and other protectionist measures. An example of such a change is the increase of the Slovak corporate tax rate from 19% to 23% effective January 1, 2013, followed by a decrease to 22% effective January 1, 2014.\nAny future foreign acquisitions or expansions could expose us to similar risks.\nOur operations are subject to complex regulatory and compliance frameworks that pose increased risk.\nComplex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including but not limited to U. S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program, and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose the Company and its employees to elevated risk. The Company's subsidiaries and joint ventures face similar risks. Although we have implemented policies and processes designed to comply with these laws and regulations, failure by our employees, contractors, or agents to comply with these laws and regulations can result in possible administrative, civil, or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to the Company and its employees.\nU. S. Steel has incurred and may incur in the future, facility carrying costs when production capacity is idled, increased costs to resume production at idled facilities, or costs to idle facilities.\nOur decisions concerning which facilities to operate and at what levels are made based upon our customers\u2019 orders for products as well as the capabilities and cost performance of our locations. In depressed markets such as those experienced in the recent recession, we concentrated production operations at several plant locations and did not operate others in response to customer demand.\nWhen we restart idled facilities, we incur costs to replenish raw material inventories, prepare the previously idled facilities for operation, perform the required repair and maintenance activities and prepare employees to return to work safely and resume production responsibilities.\nFaced with temporary or structural overcapacity in various markets, we may in the future seek to rationalize operations through asset sales, temporary shutdowns or closures of facilities. Prior to U. S. Steel Canada's CCAA filing, we permanently shut down the iron and steelmaking facilities at the Hamilton Works which resulted in a charge of $237 million in 2013. Future initiatives may lead to significant costs or charges.\nWe are subject to significant foreign currency risks, which can negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nOur foreign operations accounted for approximately 25 percent of our net sales in 2014. The financial condition and results of operations of USSK and USSC, prior to U. S. Steel Canada's CCAA filing, were reported in euros and Canadian dollars, respectively, and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Canadian dollar has had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nIn addition, international cash requirements have been and in the future may be funded by intercompany loans, creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved, which can have a non-cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each period.\nFinancial regulatory frameworks introduced by U.S. and EU regulators can limit our financial flexibility or increase our costs.\nThe Commodity Future Trading Commission\u2019s Dodd Frank and the EU\u2019s EMIR regulatory frameworks can limit our company\u2019s ability to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange (FX), or commodity pricing exposures, which could expose us to increased economic risk. These frameworks may introduce additional compliance costs. Some counterparties may cease hedging as a result of increased regulatory cost burdens, which in turn may reduce U. S. Steel\u2019s ability to hedge its interest rate, FX, or commodity exposures. Legislative uncertainty exists regarding possible margin requirements and clearing practices that could economically impact U. S. Steel. If additional liquidity is required under\nregulatory frameworks to support new margin requirements, that could reduce U. S. Steel\u2019s liquidity available to invest in its core business operations.\nThe IRS can disallow all or part of a worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction taken in 2013.\nU. S. Steel made an election effective December 31, 2013 to liquidate for U.S income tax purposes a foreign subsidiary that holds most of the Company\u2019s international operations. The tax liquidation allowed the Company to claim a worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction in its 2013 U.S. income tax return, resulting in a net income tax benefit in 2013 of $419 million. The worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction are subject to audit and possible adjustment by the IRS, which could result in the reversal of all or part of the income tax benefit. While we believe we have adequate legal and factual support for the tax position taken, the IRS could reject or reduce the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction. If this occurs, U. S. Steel would incur additional current tax expense which could result in additional income tax payments.\nOur business requires substantial expenditures for debt service obligations, capital investments, operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund.\nWith $3.1 billion of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014, we have significant debt service requirements.\nOur operations are capital intensive. For the five-year period ended December 31, 2014, total capital expenditures were $3.1 billion. At December 31, 2014, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment totaled $326 million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of $284 million under operating leases.\nIn addition to capital expenditures and lease payments, we spend significant amounts for maintenance of our raw material, iron and steelmaking and steel-finishing facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately $161 million and contractual purchase commitments, including \u201ctake or pay\u201d arrangements, totaling approximately $8.6 billion.\nOur business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient, to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. The limitations under our Amended Credit Agreement and RPA, described above, may limit our availability to draw upon these facilities.\nU. S. Steel is exposed to uninsured losses.\nOur insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions, substantial deductibles and self insured retentions.\nWe are at risk of labor stoppages and our collective bargaining agreements can limit our flexibility.\nMost hourly employees of U. S. Steel\u2019s flat-rolled, tubular, cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the United States are covered by the 2012 Labor Agreements, which expire on September 1, 2015. These agreements contain provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any North American transaction involving steel or steel-related assets without the consent of the USW, grant the USW a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the 2012 Labor Agreements, require us to make reasonable and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities and require mandatory pre-funding of a trust for retiree health care and life insurance. These agreements also restrict our ability to trade, sell or use foreign-produced coke and iron ore in North America, and further require that the ratio of non-USW employees to USW employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five.\nWhile other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the USW, non-union producers are not subject to such requirements.\nIn Europe, most represented employees at USSK are represented by the OZ Metalurg union and are covered by an agreement that expires at the end of March 2016.\nMany international competitors operate in jurisdictions where employees have significantly fewer rights, which may give an advantage to such competitors.\nWe are at risk for work stoppages thereafter or if unauthorized job actions occur.\nThere are risks associated with future acquisitions.\nThe success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, as well as to finance such acquisitions and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations. If we are unable to integrate new operations successfully, our financial results and business reputation could suffer. Additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with the sellers, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience. International acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the Company\u2019s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries. Antitrust and other laws may prevent us from completing acquisitions.\nThere are risks associated with existing and potential accounting and tax requirements.\nOur use of intercompany loans has and in the future may have significant impacts on our financial statements as a result of foreign currency accounting remeasurement effects. Potential future accounting changes could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow. Even if the impacts are non cash, they may materially impact perceptions and judgments about us by rating agencies and investors. Changes in tax law could also negatively affect our profitability and cash flow.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the resolution of which can negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period.\nOur profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nProvisions of Delaware Law and our governing documents can make a takeover of U. S. Steel more difficult.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors. Such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price and therefore may be appealing to some or all stockholders.\nA person or group can establish a substantial position in U. S. Steel stock.\nWe do not have a stockholder rights plan which may make it easier for a person or group to acquire a substantial position in U. S. Steel stock. Such person or group may have interests adverse to the interests of other stockholders.\nWe may suffer employment losses, which can negatively affect our future performance.\nOver the last few years we have intensified our recruitment, training and retention efforts so that we may continue to optimally staff our operations. If we are unable to hire sufficient qualified replacements for those employees that leave U. S. Steel, our future performance may be adversely impacted.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure can adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we continue to deploy an ERP system at various locations to help us operate more efficiently. We implemented our ERP system at our Mon Valley Works in 2012, Gary Works in 2013 and Granite City Works and Great Lakes Works in 2014. This is a complex project, which we anticipate will be completed in 2016; however, we may not be able to successfully complete the ERP program at our remaining locations without experiencing difficulties. In addition, the expected benefits of completing the ERP system, such as increased productivity and operating efficiencies, may not be fully realized or the costs may outweigh the realized benefits. Further, if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important information technology system, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse affect on our business.\nOur information technology systems can be negatively affected by cyber security threats.\nIncreased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. We may face greater risks in this area than our competitors as we implement the ERP system because among other things, we must simultaneously protect both the ERP and legacy systems until the ERP project is complete.\nThe Company has experienced cyber security attacks, including breaches of our information technology systems in which information was taken. On May 19, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against certain individuals in connection with cyber crimes allegedly committed against the Company and other entities. We are cooperating with the U.S. government on this matter and have implemented enhancements and improvements to safeguard our ERP and legacy information systems against future attacks. However, there is no assurance the Company's remediation efforts will be successful in safeguarding information from future attacks, which potentially could increase in frequency and in the level of sophistication associated with attempts to compromise our information systems. Based on information known to date, the Company is currently unable to determine the materiality, if any, of these events.\nWe have several operations conducted by joint ventures and other equity investees that we cannot operate solely for our benefit.\nSeveral of our joint ventures and other equity investees are strategically important to U. S. Steel. Under joint venture and other equity investee arrangements, we share ownership and management of an entity with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures and other equity investees are intended to be operated for the benefit of all of the investors, rather than for our sole benefit. The benefits from a successful joint venture or other equity arrangement are shared among the investors, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. For additional information with respect to our joint ventures and other equity investees, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services, and increases in costs or the availability of transportation can adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials.\nIf any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture and deliver our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost.\nIn addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use in our production processes are transported by railroad, trucks, barges and ships, which are highly regulated. Changes in these regulations could increase our costs or reduce the availability of such transportation. In addition, an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nCarnegie Way benefits may be limited and subject to change.\nOur corporation initiated a stockholder value creation strategy: earn the right to grow, and drive and sustain profitable growth. Through a disciplined approach known as \u201cThe Carnegie Way,\u201d we continue working toward strengthening our balance sheet, with an intense focus on cash flow, and have launched a series of initiatives that we believe will enable us to add value, right-size the Company, and improve our performance across our core business processes, including commercial, supply chain, manufacturing, procurement, innovation, and operational and functional support. Business conditions, our ability to implement such initiatives, and factors beyond our control may limit the benefits associated with certain identified projects and limit the Carnegie Way's economic benefits.", "PERMNO": 76644, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "X"}
