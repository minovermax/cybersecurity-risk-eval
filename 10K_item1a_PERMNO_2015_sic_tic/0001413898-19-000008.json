{"cik": "1413898", "company": "A. H. Belo Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and estimates of factors affecting the Company\u2019s operations, both known and unknown. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking information as actual results may differ materially from the possible risks and outcomes discussed herein. In addition, a number of other factors (those identified elsewhere in this document and others, both known and unknown) may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nRisks Relating to A. H. Belo\u2019s Strategic Transformation\nThe Company\u2019s primary strategy is to transition from a print-focused media company to a digital-first media company focused on growth in its digital subscriber base and growth in its marketing solutions and digital advertising businesses.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s ability to achieve its strategic transformation from a print-focused media company to a digital-first media company is subject to several risks, including:\n\u00b7\nThe transformation may require significant investment of financial resources, and these investments may result in lower margins and increased operating expenses and capital expenditures\n\u00b7\nThe transformation may require a significant amount of time to achieve, and the Company may not be able to increase digital revenues quickly enough to offset print revenue declines\n\u00b7\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive market for talent, and it may not be successful in recruiting and retaining the type of talent required to operate and grow its digital businesses\n\ufeff\nEven if the Company implements its strategic transformation successfully, it may not result in an increase in digital revenues that sufficiently offset the declines the Company is experiencing in its traditional print media business. If the Company fails to implement its strategy effectively, or if its strategy ultimately does not result in a sufficient increase in digital revenues, its business, financial condition, and results of operation may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nRisks Relating to the Publishing Segment\nA. H. Belo\u2019s Publishing segment operates in a highly competitive media market, and the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue depends on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s strategy to promote new and existing products.\nHistorically, newspaper publishing was viewed as a cost-effective method of delivery for various forms of advertising to a large audience. The continued development and deployment of new technologies and greater competition from digital media increase the challenge to provide competitive offerings to retain the Company\u2019s print and digital advertisers. In addition, many national advertisers, which place advertising in the Company\u2019s newspaper, have significantly reduced marketing budgets. These advertisers are centralizing purchasing functions and streamlining the buying and negotiating process. This could result in further commoditization of certain advertising products, which limits the Company\u2019s ability to promote its position in the market, the customer service value of its relationship with advertisers, and the benefits of its suite of products, including the Company\u2019s ability to upsell other products. This may also put the Company in competition with other advertising companies that are able to offer lower prices for a larger geographical area than the Company covers. Accordingly, the Company could experience a decline in pricing which could result in lower revenues and profitability.\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo\u2019s newspaper and the newspaper industry as a whole are challenged to maintain and grow print circulation volume. To the extent circulation volume declines cannot be offset by rate increases, the Company will realize lower circulation revenue. Circulation volume declines could also result in lower rates and volumes for advertising revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to stabilize circulation revenue through price increases and by growing its paid digital subscriber base may be affected by competition from other forms of media and other publications available in the Company\u2019s markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items such as newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time, and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among certain demographic groups. The Company may also incur higher costs competing for paid circulation. If the Company is not able to compete effectively, revenue may decline and the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nThe Company competes for advertising and circulation revenue with other newspapers, websites, digital applications, magazines, television, radio, direct mail and other media. The continued expansion of digital media and communications, particularly social media, mobile applications and the proliferation of tablet and mobile devices, has increased some consumers\u2019 preference to receive all or part of their news and information digitally. Websites such as craigslist.org, monster.com and cars.com provide a cost efficient platform for\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H. Belo Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nreaching wide but targeted audiences for classified advertising. Websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo! are successful in gathering and making available national and local news and information from multiple sources and attracting a broad readership base.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to develop and manage the Publishing segment\u2019s digital business in response to the changes in consumers\u2019 preferences and behaviors, as well as changes to advertising expenditures, as described above. To be successful, the Company must:\n\u00b7\nAttract advertisers to the Company\u2019s digital products\n\u00b7\nContinue to increase digital audiences by providing consumers important and relevant news content regarding the North Texas market\n\u00b7\nTailor products for mobile devices\n\u00b7\nInvest funds and resources in digital opportunities\n\u00b7\nLeverage existing print products, brands and technologies to distinguish digital products and services from those of competitors\n\u00b7\nStructure its sales force accordingly\n\u00b7\nAttract and retain employees with the skills and knowledge needed to support a successful digital business\nThe Company\u2019s potential inability to execute cost control measures successfully within its Publishing segment could result in total operating costs that are greater than expected.\n\ufeff\nThe primary costs of the Company\u2019s publishing operations include employee compensation and benefits, followed by distribution costs, newsprint and other production materials and technology costs. The Company has taken steps to lower costs through selling or discontinuing unprofitable operations and products, reducing personnel, restructuring employee benefits, and implementing general cost control measures. Although the Company continues its cost control efforts, it may be unable to continue to match revenue declines with offsetting cost reductions.\n\ufeff\nCertain operating costs may not fluctuate directly with changes in revenue, which could result in lower margins if advertising and circulation volumes decline. The Company could experience inflationary pressures from newsprint and other suppliers and be unable to generate additional revenue or additional cost reductions to offset these pressures. The Company utilizes outside service providers to distribute its newspaper and certain preprint advertising through the mail. Higher fuel costs and/or postage rates or an increase in rates from outside service providers could result in higher direct costs incurred by the Company.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing costs of healthcare benefits offered to employees requires the Company to evaluate the scope of benefits offered and the method by which health care benefits are delivered. Competition for qualified personnel may require the Company to spend more on compensation costs, including employee benefits, to attract and retain its workforce. There may be other factors outside of the Company\u2019s control that could increase employee compensation costs, including, but not limited to, an increase in the minimum wage.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not be able to pass on to customers these potential cost increases given the significant competition for advertising dollars and the ability of customers to obtain news from other media at a low cost. If the Company does not achieve expected savings or if operating costs increase due to the creation and development of new products, total operating costs may be greater than anticipated.\n\ufeff\nThe Company believes appropriate steps are being taken to control costs. However, if the Company is not successful in matching revenue declines with corresponding cost reductions, the Company\u2019s ability to generate future profits could be affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H. Belo Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNewsprint prices are volatile and may increase in the future, and newsprint supply may become increasingly scarce as paper mills exit the market.\n\ufeff\nThe basic raw material for newspapers is newsprint, the cost of which for the last two years has represented between 5.0 percent and 6.0 percent of A. H. Belo\u2019s revenues. The Company\u2019s publishing operations depend significantly upon the continuing availability of newsprint and the Publishing segment\u2019s results of operations may be impacted significantly by changes in newsprint prices. The price of newsprint historically has been volatile. Consolidation in the North American newsprint industry has reduced the number of suppliers and has led to paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper, which in turn has decreased overall newsprint capacity and increased the likelihood of higher prices. Other factors that may increase prices for newsprint include:\n\u00b7\nThe imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. suppliers of paper\n\u00b7\nIncreases in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors\n\u00b7\nDecreases in the Company\u2019s current consumption levels\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s inability to maintain existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s ability to supply its publishing operation with newsprint has been and may continue to be disrupted by such factors as:\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s suppliers may be unable to deliver newsprint due to labor unrest\n\u00b7\nTrucks or other means of transporting newsprint may become unavailable\n\u00b7\nPaper mills may close at a faster rate than declines in the demand for paper\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo currently purchases most of its newsprint through a purchasing consortium. Significant increases in newsprint costs or the Company\u2019s inability to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint in the future could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation and brands are key assets and negative perceptions or publicity could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company has a reputation for producing reliable, high-quality journalism and content. The Company\u2019s reputation and brands are key assets and must be preserved and leveraged for the Company to continue to be successful. If the Company\u2019s reputation is damaged or if consumers perceive the Company\u2019s products to be less reliable, the business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H. Belo Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Relating to the Marketing Services Segment\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo\u2019s Marketing Services segment operates in a highly competitive market. If the Company does not compete effectively, the Marketing Service segment\u2019s results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has introduced new product and service initiatives designed to grow Marketing Services revenue and digital advertising, and to respond to the challenges of maintaining revenue in existing markets. Marketing Services offerings are rapidly evolving as business customers seek quantifiable results to measure the effectiveness of advertising spending. The Company\u2019s Marketing Services customers primarily represent mid-sized businesses with varying degrees of knowledge and familiarity with online marketing and advertising campaigns. The success of the Company\u2019s Marketing Services offerings is dependent on various factors, including the ability to:\n\u00b7\nIncrease the Company\u2019s client base and achieve broader market acceptance of its suite of cross-channel, interactive marketing solutions\n\u00b7\nOvercome challenges related to the accuracy or perceived accuracy of metrics provided and the ability of the customer to properly interpret the effectiveness of advertising campaigns against benchmarks that may not be reliable\n\u00b7\nEducate customers on the benefits of marketing services to their businesses\n\u00b7\nObtain new clients as well as sell additional products and services to existing clients\n\u00b7\nMaintain or increase the rates on products\n\u00b7\nLeverage existing print products, brands and technologies to distinguish products and services from those of competitors\nGrowth of the Marketing Services segment is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to market its existing products and services successfully and to develop and invest in new and complimentary products and services.\nTechnology in the marketing services industry continues to evolve rapidly. The Company\u2019s ability to grow its Marketing Services revenue is dependent on continued investment in expanding the functionality of existing products and in the development and acquisition of new, complimentary products and services. The Company may not be able to sustain the level of investment required and even after developing or acquiring additional product and service offerings, may not be able to integrate them successfully into existing product and service offerings.\nThe success of the Marketing Services segment is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, hire, motivate and retain employees with the skills and technical knowledge required to successfully sell and implement its products.\n\ufeff\nThere is intense competition for scarce talent with skills in new technologies, and the Company may be unable to cost-effectively hire new employees with these skills, which may incur increased costs. The ability to achieve significant future revenue growth will depend on the Company\u2019s success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales and implementation professionals. New and planned hires require significant training and time before sales and implementation teams become fully productive. The Company\u2019s growth could be hindered if these sales and implementation professionals are not successful in generating a corresponding significant increase in revenue.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nRisks Relating to A. H. Belo\u2019s Overall Business\n\ufeff\nData security breaches, other security threats and information technology system disruptions could negatively impact A. H. Belo\u2019s businesses, reputation and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems are critically important to operating its businesses efficiently and effectively. Information systems may be affected by cybersecurity incidents that can result from deliberate attacks or system failures. Maintaining network security is critical. Threats include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, computer hackings, disruptive software, error or malfeasance by an employee, or other malicious activities. Information systems may also be compromised by natural disasters, fire, power outages, terrorism or other similar events.\n\ufeff\nThe Company depends on the security of its third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to the third-party service providers\u2019 networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of the Company\u2019s systems and confidential information.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H. Belo Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThere can be no assurance that the actions and controls implemented by the Company, or its third-party service providers will be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s data, release of confidential information, disruptions to critical systems or corruption of data. Cyber-attacks evolve quickly and often are not recognized until after they are launched, and the Company may be unable to anticipate them or implement adequate measures to prevent a breach.\n\ufeff\nCyber-attacks, disruptions or failures could result in processing inefficiencies, late or missed publications, loss of sales and customers, and transaction errors, any of which could negatively affect the business or results of operations. The coverage and limits of the Company\u2019s insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse the Company for all losses caused by security breaches and business interruptions.\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo relies on third-party service providers for various services.\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on third-party providers for various technology and services including, but not limited to, network and infrastructure services, email, news content management, customer relationship management, circulation distribution, benefits and payroll processing, and financial management systems. The Company does not control the operations of these service providers, which are subject to similar security threats that the Company could experience, such as malicious activities or natural disasters. The continued and uninterrupted performance of third-party systems and services is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and any significant interruption due to system failures could be disruptive to the business. In addition, if third-party service providers face financial difficulties or terminate their relationship with the Company, this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy its customers or operate the business, and could affect results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe sufficiency of the Company\u2019s liquidity is dependent upon meeting future financial goals.\n\ufeff\nAlthough the Company\u2019s cash holdings are sufficient to meet foreseeable operating needs, the Company must achieve expected financial goals. Unplanned events such as tax obligations, significant loss of revenue, unprofitable operations, deterioration of collections of receivables or mandatory pension plan contributions, could accelerate the use of the Company\u2019s cash balances. These factors may impact the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends at the historical rate or to raise financial capital for investments or acquisitions necessary for the Company\u2019s long-term growth.\n\ufeff\nSignificant turnover of key employees could expose the Company to loss.\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo relies on the efforts of its senior executive officers and other members of management. The Company is located in a vibrant economic region of the United States with low unemployment and strong competition for senior management personnel. The success of the Company\u2019s businesses depends heavily on its ability to execute the required responsibilities of these roles as well as the Company\u2019s ability to retain current management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. The loss of key personnel would result in additional recruiting and training costs to the Company, and the potential delay of operations until the hires have sufficient knowledge commensurate with their assigned duties.\n\ufeff\nMarket conditions could increase the funding requirements associated with the Company\u2019s pension plans.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is the sole sponsor of A. H. Belo Pension Plans I and II (collectively, the \u201cA. H. Belo Pension Plans\u201d) and is required to meet certain pension funding requirements as established under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Instability in global and domestic capital markets may result in low returns on the assets contributed to the A. H. Belo Pension Plans. Additionally, low yields on corporate bonds may decrease the discount rate, resulting in a higher funding obligation. Although legislation was enacted into law in 2012 which provided limited funding relief, market conditions could materially increase the funding requirements associated with the A. H. Belo Pension Plans, with an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nAdverse results from new litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations could adversely affect A. H. Belo\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo and its subsidiaries may be subject to litigation, including matters relating to alleged libel or defamation, governmental proceedings and investigations. Adverse determinations in any such matters could require A. H. Belo to make monetary payments or result in other sanctions or findings that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage, if any, may not be adequate to cover all costs and/or losses. In some instances, the Company may have a contractual obligation from a third-party to indemnify liabilities related to litigation or governmental investigation, but if the third-party fails to indemnify us, the Company would be responsible for monetary damages.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H. Belo Corporation 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Relating to A. H. Belo\u2019s Stock\nThe market price of A. H. Belo\u2019s common stock may be volatile.\nMany factors could cause the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock to rise and fall, including, but not limited to, declining newspaper print circulation, gain or loss of significant advertisers or other customers, acquisitions or investments, low stock trading volume, changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow the Company\u2019s stock, and changes in market conditions of the media industry or the economy as a whole.\n\ufeff\nThe Company cannot guarantee the timing, declaration, amount, or payment of dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\ufeff\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders falls within the discretion of the board of directors. The board\u2019s decision regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as the Company\u2019s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, potential future mandatory pension contributions and other factors the board deems relevant.\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo\u2019s directors and executive officers have significant combined voting power and significant influence over its management and affairs.\n\ufeff\nA. H. Belo directors and executive officers hold approximately 50 percent of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock as of December 31, 2018. A. H. Belo\u2019s Series A common stock has one vote per share and Series B common stock has 10 votes per share. Accordingly, A. H. Belo\u2019s directors and executive officers will have significant influence over the Company\u2019s management and affairs and over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of the Company\u2019s Certificate of Formation and Bylaws, and significant corporate transactions and transactions with or benefitting certain \u201cInterested Shareholders,\u201d as defined in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Formation. This ownership may limit other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, A. H. Belo may take actions that some shareholders do not view as beneficial.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 92528, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "AHC"}
