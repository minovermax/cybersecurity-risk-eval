{"cik": "800459", "company": "HARMAN INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIES INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below.\nWe may not realize sales represented by awarded business.\nOur current estimate of $24.1 billion of awarded business at June 30, 2016 in our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio segments is calculated using certain assumptions from our customers, including projected future sales volumes and take rates with respect to the applicable platforms. Orders from our customers with respect to these platforms are not made pursuant to contractual obligations and our customers can terminate arrangements with us at any time without penalty. Therefore, our actual platform sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such platforms, are not committed. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business, we could realize substantially less revenue and profit over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate.\nFailure to maintain relationships with our largest customers and failure by our customers to continue to purchase expected quantities of our products would have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe anticipate that our automotive customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. Our three largest automotive customers accounted for 40 percent of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2016. However, none of our automotive customers is obligated to any long-term purchases of our products. For example, although sales to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles accounted for approximately 15 percent of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2016, sales to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles may decline to under 10 percent of our consolidated net sales by fiscal year 2018 due to changes in their sourcing strategies. While we have taken in recent years, and will continue to take, steps to diversify our awarded business to include new automotive customers in an effort to reduce our exposure to significant customer risk, there is no assurance that we will be successful. If we do not succeed in diversifying our automotive customer base, the loss of sales to any of our significant automotive customers would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe demand for our connected car products may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on portable devices, such as mobile handsets and tablets, and other disruptive technological developments.\nSales of our connected car products represented approximately 45 percent of our net sales in fiscal year 2016. GPS/navigation technologies have been incorporated into portable devices, such as mobile handsets and tablets, and many companies offer navigation software for such devices. If automakers choose to replace embedded infotainment systems with portable devices, or other disruptive technologies, the acceptance of an alternative technology by consumers may negatively impact the demand for our connected car products. If we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies, this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nPricing pressure from our customers in the automotive industry could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nDownward pricing pressures by automobile manufacturers is a characteristic of the automotive industry. Virtually all automakers have implemented aggressive price reduction initiatives and objectives each year with their suppliers, and such actions are expected to continue in the future. For example, our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing (\u201cAPRs\u201d) of our products over the period of production. Accordingly, suppliers must be able to reduce their operating costs in order to maintain profitability. While we have taken steps to reduce our operating costs and otherwise offset APRs, price reductions have impacted our sales and are expected to continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to offset APRs in the future through improved\noperating efficiencies, new manufacturing processes, sourcing alternatives and other cost reduction initiatives, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have significant operations in Europe which may be adversely impacted by the continued economic challenges in Europe, including the impact of the referendum in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K\u201d) approving the exit of the U.K. from the European Union.\nThe global economic recession that began in 2008 resulted in significantly lower demand and decreased profitability across all of our segments and major markets. While North America and Asia have shown an improved, but somewhat uneven recovery, Europe remains stagnant with continued economic and financial challenges. Recent events in Europe, including the approval of the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, have elevated concerns that macroeconomic conditions will worsen and economic recovery will be delayed. If weak economic conditions persist or worsen, there could be a number of negative effects on our business, including our customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of one or more of our key suppliers, which could result in production delays, and our customers being unable to obtain credit. Approximately 44 percent of our net sales in fiscal year 2016 were made to our customers in Europe, five percent of which represents sales to our customers in the U.K. Should conditions worsen in these markets, customer demand for our products may deteriorate which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales are denominated in Euros, which sales may be adversely impacted by the eurozone crisis and the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nApproximately 38 percent of our net sales in fiscal year 2016 were denominated in Euros, five percent of which represents sales in the U.K. Certain eurozone countries in which we operate have received financial aid packages from the European Union in the form of loans and restructuring of their sovereign debt and have introduced comprehensive fiscal austerity measures. It is unknown at this time what the relationship of the U.K. with the European Union will be following the implementation of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, the long-term impact to the Euro currency as a result, or whether other countries in the eurozone may also seek to voluntarily approve an exit from the European Union. If dissolution and replacement of the Euro currency and the potential reintroduction of individual European Union currencies should occur as a result of the continued eurozone crisis, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could expose us to increased foreign exchange risk.\nThe loss of business with respect to, or the lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model for which we are a supplier could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAlthough we receive award letters or contracts from our automotive customers, these award letters or contracts generally provide for the supply of a customer\u2019s requirements for a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, the sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of the introduction of new vehicles by our automotive customers. The loss of business with respect to, or the lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model for which we are a supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nStrategic decisions by our automotive customers to expand dual sourcing arrangements could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nAutomakers customarily maintain dual sourcing arrangements and we cannot assure you that our customers will not further expand dual sourcing arrangements in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe in-sourcing of the integration of connected car and car audio systems by our automotive customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of revenue from our automotive customers depends on such customers utilizing our services for the integration of various components comprising connected car or car audio systems into the vehicles they manufacture. The in-sourcing of the integration of connected car and car audio systems by our automotive customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to deliver products on time to our automotive customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn connection with the award of new business for an automotive customer, we often obligate ourselves to deliver new products and services that are subject to the customer\u2019s timing. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order to launch programs successfully. We have products in various stages of development for our automotive customers. If we do not complete our development efforts and coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in time to\nmeet our customers\u2019 vehicle production requirements, we could be subject to monetary penalties and damage our customer relationships, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial distress or bankruptcy of a significant automotive customer could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, approximately 65 percent of our net sales were to automobile manufacturers. As a result, our financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the automotive industry, which is highly dependent on general economic conditions and periodically has experienced significant difficulty. As a result, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, reductions in orders from our original equipment manufacturer customers. If one or more of our significant automotive customers experiences increased financial difficulty, including bankruptcy, as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, this would have an adverse effect on our business due to decreased demand for our products, the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us, or both. As part of the bankruptcy process, our pre-petition receivables may not be realized, customer manufacturing sites may be closed or contracts voided. The bankruptcy of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may lose market share if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nWe operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards and changes in customer requirements, and are characterized by intense price competition. Some of our existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, financial, technical and other resources greater than ours. We cannot assure you that we will continue to compete effectively against existing or new competitors that may enter our markets or that certain of our products will not become obsolete due to technological developments. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to develop, introduce and achieve market acceptance of new and enhanced products, our sales may decrease.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. In order to increase sales in current markets and gain entry into new markets, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to maintain and improve existing products, while successfully developing and introducing distinctive new and enhanced products that anticipate changing consumer preferences and capitalize upon emerging technologies. We may experience difficulties that delay or prevent the development, introduction or market acceptance of new or enhanced products. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely launch of new products. Also, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed. The timely availability of these products is important to our future success. Furthermore, we may need to license or acquire new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses or acquisitions may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. Even after introduction, our new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products. As a result, these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer. Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA decrease in consumer discretionary spending would likely reduce our sales.\nOur sales are dependent on discretionary spending by consumers, which could be materially adversely impacted by economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income and retail sales. In addition, our sales of audio, electronic and connected car products to automotive customers are dependent on the overall success of the automotive industry, and of premium automobiles in particular, as well as the willingness of automobile purchasers to pay for the option of a premium branded car audio system or a multi-function digital connected car system. Global demand for, and production of, premium vehicles, including certain vehicle models that incorporate our products, could decline in a difficult economic environment. This decline could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe macroeconomic environment may adversely affect consumer spending patterns and the availability and cost of credit.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions. Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit in the future. The historical disruptions in the financial markets that occurred within the past eight years, coupled with uncertainty created as a result of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, have had and will\ncontinue to have an adverse effect on the global economy, which has and will continue to negatively impact consumer spending patterns. This may result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. There can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit.\nSophisticated and targeted cyber crime could pose a risk to the security of our products and services.\nSophisticated and targeted cyber crime could pose a risk to the security of our products and services. We may incur significant costs related to the threat of, and to address any damages caused by, unauthorized access to or intentional malfunctions in our products, including but not limited to, costs to protect our products and address defective products, costs or penalties related to regulatory investigations and litigation costs. Our reputation and brand names could be materially damaged by the threat or perpetration of cyber crime and the sales of our products and services may decrease, which in turn could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nIn connection with our services and as we develop new products, we may gain access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs.\nWarranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe warrant our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for periods ranging from six months to six years. We also face the inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products fail to perform as expected and such failure results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). In addition, if any of our designed products are defective or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall campaign. Warranty claims in excess of our estimates, a successful product liability claim or a requirement that we participate in a product recall campaign may adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nA disruption in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite our efforts to protect data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, including our intellectual property or trade secrets, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, production downtimes and operational disruptions. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized.\nOur future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base. We have identified certain regions, including China, Brazil, Russia and India, as key markets likely to experience substantial growth, and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments, both directly and through participation in partnerships and joint ventures, in manufacturing operations, technical centers and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these regions. If we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in these regions, we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments, but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of\nother markets, potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors. Our results of operations and financial condition will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we anticipate.\nOur cash flow and ability to service debt is dependent, in part, upon distributions from our subsidiaries.\nOur ability to service our debt and pay dividends is dependent, in part, upon the operating earnings of our subsidiaries. The distribution of those earnings, or advances or other distributions of funds by those subsidiaries to Harman International Industries, Incorporated, all of which could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon the subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and are subject to various business considerations, including tax consequences.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our future operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer, our business may be materially adversely affected. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.\nNatural disasters, geo-political events and the failure of our information technology and communication systems could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, floods, earthquakes and tsunamis, geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks, or power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems, in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of our customers to reach or have transportation to our channel partners directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which channel partners are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers\u2019 disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of materials and products from our local and overseas suppliers, the disruption or delay in the transport or delivery of goods from overseas to our facilities or to our channel partners, the disruption of utility services to our facilities, the disruption of our information technology, including databases containing sensitive information, and disruption in our communications with our facilities customers and suppliers. If we failed to implement and maintain a comprehensive disaster recovery program and any of the foregoing events occurs, such events and their impacts could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our suppliers for key production materials and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs.\nMany of our suppliers have in the past, and could in the future decrease their manufacturing capacity and inventory levels. If these steps are taken by our suppliers, it could make us more vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain. In the near term, an increase in our demand for parts may place an undue strain on our suppliers. Additionally, the supply of raw materials including, without limitation, petroleum, copper, steel, aluminum, synthetic resins, rare metals and rare earth minerals, such as neodymium used in the production of loudspeakers, has been and could continue to be significantly constrained, which is likely to result in continued elevated price levels. Furthermore, our continued compliance with the SEC\u2019s annual disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As a result of any of these disruptions, we may not be able to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture our products, which could force us to cease production or search for alternative supply sources, possibly at a higher cost, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands and our implementation of a sufficient brand protection program.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands, and our customers\u2019 connection to our brands. Brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to our growth strategies, our development efforts in domestic and foreign markets, or the ordinary course of our business. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond our ability to control and may damage our brands, such as counterfeit and knock-off products, litigation and claims, and\nillegal activity targeted at us or others. Consumer demand for our products and our brands\u2019 value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products, and if we do not implement a brand protection program that sufficiently addresses the issue of counterfeit and knock-off products, among other things, either of which would likely result in lower net sales and, ultimately, lower income, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of our intellectual property rights, our business may decline.\nOur future success will depend, in substantial part, on our intellectual property. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights, but our actions may not adequately protect the rights covered by our patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications and other proprietary rights, and prosecution of our claims could be time consuming and costly. In addition, the intellectual property laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, third parties may obtain, disclose or use our proprietary information without our authorization, which could adversely affect our business. From time to time, third parties have alleged that we infringe their proprietary rights. These claims or similar future claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights, limit our ability to use infringing intellectual property or force us to license third-party technology rather than dispute the merits of any infringement claim. Even if we prevail, any associated litigation could be time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of our time and resources.\nWe may be adversely affected by future laws or regulations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. laws and regulations. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the cost of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. A recent example of such changing regulation is the adoption by the SEC of annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those SEC reporting companies who manufacture or contract to manufacture products that contain conflict minerals, and such minerals are necessary to the production or functionality of such product. There are historical and continued future costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such diligence activities.\nWe are engaged in ongoing litigation and may be the subject of additional litigation that may result in payments to third parties, which could harm our business and financial results.\nWe are currently involved in litigation arising out of or relating to the events leading up to the termination of the proposed acquisition of our Company in October 2007 and certain earnings guidance provided by us. In addition, similar litigation has been and may be initiated against us and others based on the alleged activities and disclosures at issue in the pending litigation. We cannot predict the outcome of any such proceeding or the likelihood that further proceedings will be instituted against us. In the event that there is an adverse ruling in any legal proceeding, we may be required to make payments to third parties that could harm our business or cash flows or financial results. Furthermore, regardless of the merits of any claim, the continued maintenance of these legal proceedings may result in substantial legal expense and could also result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention away from our business.\nCurrency fluctuations may reduce profits on our foreign sales or increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant amount of our assets and operations are located, and the majority of our revenue is derived from, sales outside the United States. Consequently, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the Euro. Translation losses or a decrease in foreign sales of our products sold in United States dollars, each resulting from currency fluctuations, may adversely affect the profits from our foreign operations and have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, we purchase certain foreign-made products. Although we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure and, due to the multiple currencies involved in our business, foreign currency positions partially offset and are netted against one another to reduce exposure, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not make these products more expensive to purchase. Increases in our cost of purchasing these products could negatively impact our financial results if we are not able to pass those increased costs on to our customers.\nCovenants in our existing debt agreements limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions.\nOur existing debt agreements contain provisions that limit our operating and financing activities. Our credit agreement contains certain negative covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to permit certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur liens, make fundamental changes (including selling all or substantially all of our assets), undertake transactions with affiliates and undertake sale and leaseback transactions. Our indentures contain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to incur indebtedness secured by principal properties, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all of the assets of our Company. In addition, our credit agreement contains more restrictive financial covenants that require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. We may have to curtail some of our operations to maintain compliance with the covenants in our existing debt agreements. A violation of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of any borrowings outstanding and/or the holders of the notes to direct the trustee to accelerate repayment of amounts outstanding under the notes. A default or acceleration under our debt agreements would result in increased capital costs and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and we may be unable to integrate such acquisitions effectively, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our corporate growth strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas of risk we face include, but are not limited to, difficulties in the integration of the acquired businesses, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the assumption of unknown liabilities, undisclosed risks impacting the target and potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with our current customers and suppliers. In addition, our recent acquisitions have resulted in the incurrence of a significant amount of debt. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, impairment of goodwill or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could be material in amount and harm our financial condition or results. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we have recently undertaken or will undertake in the future or that such acquisitions will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flows. Any such failure could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations could be harmed by factors including political instability and changes in regulations that govern international transactions.\nThe risks inherent in international trade may reduce our international sales and harm our business and the businesses of our distributors and suppliers. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nchanges in tariff regulations;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability, war, terrorism and other political risks;\n\u00b7\nestablishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors and dealers;\n\u00b7\nlengthy shipping times and accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u00b7\nimport and export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property rights than in the United States; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations.\nThese and other risks may, among other things, increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, reducing the demand for our products.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a strike or work stoppage at one of our manufacturing plants or at a facility of one of our significant customers or at a common carrier or major shipping location.\nWorkers at certain of our facilities and those of our automotive customers are unionized and may incur work stoppages or strikes. A work stoppage at our facilities or those of our automotive customers, or at a common carrier or major shipping location, could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and financial condition. The risk of issues of this type at our facilities may be exacerbated by the implementation of our current or future cost reduction initiatives, which may involve significant staff reductions and facility relocations.\nWe have deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur consolidated financial statements include net deferred tax assets of $108.1 million as of June 30, 2016, which relate to temporary differences between the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on various projections for future taxable income reversing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Thus, when actual taxable income differs from projections, it may become necessary to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nImpairment charges relating to our goodwill and long-lived assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe regularly monitor our goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment indicators. We perform either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis. In conducting the impairment analysis of long-lived assets, we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets. In the event that we determine that our goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the period(s) recognized.", "PERMNO": 75224, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "HAR"}
