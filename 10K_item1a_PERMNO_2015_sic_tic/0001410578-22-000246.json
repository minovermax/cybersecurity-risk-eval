{"cik": "723188", "company": "COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are risks inherent in the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Adverse experience with these could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates affect our profitability, assets and liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s income and cash flow depends to a great extent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (1) its ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, which could reduce the amount of fee income generated, (2) the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities, and (3) the average duration of the Company\u2019s various categories of earning assets. Earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income could also be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings. Increases in interest rates would likely cause an increase in the unrealized loss position on certain investments, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings if the need to liquidate these investments arose. Although management believes it has implemented asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may adversely affect LIBOR-based financial arrangements of the Company.\nThe Company has certain mortgage loans, hedging transactions, and floating-rate commercial loans that determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to LIBOR. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, it was announced that the rate would continue to be published through June 2023. However, the FRB has urged banks to make the transition as soon as practicable and that no new contracts should include LIBOR after the original end date of December 31, 2021.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain committees, such as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended alternative to LIBOR, and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate financial instruments. It is currently unknown the extent to which these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nUncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates, and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR, may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based financial arrangements of the Company. While not expected to be material to the Company due to its insignificant exposure to LIBOR-based loans and financial instruments, the implementation of an alternative index or indices for the Company\u2019s financial arrangements may result in the Company incurring expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability of the alternative index to LIBOR, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations, support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities.\nThe Company liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility, a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, or deposit competition based on interest rates, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; counterparty availability; interest rate fluctuations; general economic conditions; and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing the Company\u2019s funding transactions. Many of the foregoing conditions and factors may be caused by events over which the Company has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. Further, the Company\u2019s customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is uncertain as to whether the relatively high levels of deposits in recent periods will be maintained, spent down, or increased further by additional inflows of funds associated with COVID-19 related government stimulus programs. If these deposits were to be spent down at levels exceeding expectations, or if the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms, or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company\u2019s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nCredit and Lending Risk\nThe allowance for credit losses may be insufficient.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the creditworthiness of its customers. The Company reviews the allowance for credit losses quarterly for adequacy considering historical credit loss experience, current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels, risk ratings as well as changes in macroeconomic conditions. If the Company\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease its net income. It is possible that over time the allowance for credit losses will be inadequate to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), also referred to as CECL. Under this new standard, the Company\u2019s required allowance for credit losses may fluctuate more significantly from period to period due to changes in economic conditions, changes in the composition of the Company\u2019s loan portfolios, changes in historical loss rates and changes in other credit factors, including the level of delinquent loans.\nMortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate and refinancing activity and elections made by the Company to sell or retain mortgage production. In lower interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will tend to increase. Increases in mortgage loan sales would have the effect of increasing fee income, but could adversely impact the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s mortgage servicing rights as the rate of loan prepayments increase. In higher interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will generally be lower. Decreases in mortgage loan sales would have the effect of decreasing fee income opportunities.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risk\nThe Company is or may become involved in lawsuits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by governmental agencies or other parties that may lead to adverse consequences.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, many aspects of the Company\u2019s business involve substantial risk of legal liability. The Company and its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries\u2019 business activities (and in some cases from the activities of acquired companies). In addition, the Company is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry by, including but not limited to, bank regulatory agencies, the SEC, the U.S. Department of Labor, state insurance regulators and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to delays in or prohibition to acquire other companies, significant penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company\u2019s ultimate losses may be higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation and examination of existing laws and regulations.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern nearly every aspect of its operations. The Company, as a financial holding company, is subject to regulation by the FRB and its banking subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC. These regulations affect deposit and lending practices, capital levels and structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for credit losses. In addition, the non-bank subsidiaries are engaged in providing services including, but not limited to, retirement plan administration, fiduciary services to collective investment funds, investment management and insurance brokerage services, which industries are also heavily regulated at both a state and federal level, including by state banking and insurance agencies, the U.S. Department of Labor and the SEC. Such regulators govern the activities in which the Company and its subsidiaries may engage. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation, interpretation or application, could have a material impact on the Company and its operations. Changes to the regulatory laws governing these businesses could affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver or expand its services and adversely impact its operating and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth Act, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in the financial services sector. The ongoing effects of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as continued rule-making and possible future changes to the regulatory requirements, may substantially impact the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s operations. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act depend to a large extent on the implementation of the legislation by the FRB, the CFPB, and other agencies as well as how market practices and structures change in response to the requirements of such rule making. New initiatives and proposed rulemaking by the CFPB may significantly limit the fees the Company may charge for its services and such proposed rulemaking may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s fee income. Changes in regulations could subject the Company, among other things, to additional costs for compliance and limit the types of financial services and products it can offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products.\nThe Company is also directly subject to the requirements of entities that set and interpret the accounting standards such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and indirectly subject to the actions and interpretations of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which establishes auditing and related professional practice standards for registered public accounting firms and inspects registered firms to assess their compliance with certain laws, rules, and professional standards in public company audits. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions and their holding companies conduct business, engage in strategic and tax planning, implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions, restrictions to its business model, and money penalties by state and federal agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for more information about the regulations to which the Company is subject.\nThe Company depends on dividends from its banking subsidiary for cash revenues to support common dividend payments and other uses, but those dividends are subject to restrictions.\nThe ability of the Company to satisfy its obligations and pay cash dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent on the earnings of and dividends from the subsidiary bank. However, payment of dividends by the bank subsidiary is limited by dividend restrictions and capital requirements imposed by bank regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion and is therefore subject to additional regulation and increased supervision including the CFPB.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Since 2017, when the Company surpassed the $10 billion threshold, the Company has become subject to changes, including but not limited to, the following: (1) supervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws, (2) a modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates, (3) limitations on interchange fees for debit card transactions, (4) heightened compliance standards under the Volcker Rule, and (5) enhanced supervision as a larger financial institution. The imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision may continue to require additional commitment of financial resources to regulatory compliance and may increase the Company\u2019s cost of operations and provide greater limitations on the products and services that can be offered by the Company and the Bank.\nBasel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses.\nThe FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC adopted final rules for the Basel III capital framework which substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company. The rules phased in over time and became fully effective in 2019. A capital conservation buffer was phased in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions and potentially limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses.\nIncreased regulation and stakeholder expectations related to Environmental, Social, and Governance factors could negatively affect our operating results.\nThere is increased public awareness and concern by investors, customers, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on a variety of environmental, social, and sustainability matters. This increased awareness may include more restrictive or expansive environmental standards, more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics, and other compliance requirements. The Company may face increased costs to address and report on these matters, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. If the Company is unable to adequately address environmental, social, and governance matters that are of importance to investors and customers, it could negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation and the Company\u2019s business results.\nOperational Risk\nThe Company continually encounters technological change and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could have a negative impact on the business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company's operations. Many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers and the costs of this technology may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to fraud in many aspects of the services and products that it provides.\nThe Company offers a wide variety of products and services. When account credentials and other access tools are not adequately protected by its customers, risks and potential costs may increase. As (a) sales of services and products expand, (b) those who are committing fraud become more sophisticated and more determined, and (c) services and product offerings expand, the Company's operational losses could increase.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, or operational errors, including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems or disclosure of confidential proprietary information of its customers. Negative public opinion can result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, sales practices, customer treatment, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and keep customers and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Company can result in negative public opinion about its business and financial loss.\nIf personal, nonpublic, confidential, or proprietary information of customers in the Company\u2019s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of its systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and the large transaction volumes may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. Further, the significant value of money managed and administered may result in larger exposures. The Company also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees) and to the risk that business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability to operate the Company\u2019s business, potential liability to clients, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or security breach and expose the Company to additional operational, compliance, cybersecurity and legal risks.\nThe Company relies heavily on existing and emerging communications and information systems to conduct its business. Despite the Company\u2019s security measures and business continuity plans, the Company and its vendors may be the subject of sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to assets or confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, cyber-attacks, or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to or obtain unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s systems and networks. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. The constantly changing nature of the threats means that the Company may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s online banking system, its general ledger, and its deposit and loan servicing and origination systems or other systems. Furthermore, if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Company\u2019s or vendors\u2019 possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Company\u2019s systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems; however, any such failure, interruption or security breach could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations through loss of assets or by requiring it to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing the Company to customer dissatisfaction and civil litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.\nEvolving data security and privacy requirements could increase the Company\u2019s costs and expose it to additional operational, compliance, and legal risks.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires the secure processing and storage of sensitive information relating to its customers, employees, business partners, and others. However, like any financial institution operating in today\u2019s digital business environment, the Company is subject to threats to the security of its networks and data, as described above. These threats continue to increase as the frequency, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions increase around the world. In response to these threats there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and cybersecurity in the U.S. and the European Union and as a result, the Company must comply with an evolving set of legal requirements in this area, including substantive cybersecurity standards as well as requirements for notifying regulators and affected individuals in the event of a data security incident. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to the Company\u2019s business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks.\nThe Company relies on third party vendors, which could expose the Company to additional cybersecurity risks.\nThird party vendors provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure, including certain data processing and information services. On behalf of the Company, third parties may transmit confidential, propriety information. Although the Company requires third party providers to maintain certain levels of information security, such providers may remain vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information or result in funds being transferred. While the Company may contractually limit liability in connection with attacks against third party providers, the Company remains exposed to the risk of loss associated with such vendors. In addition, a number of the Company\u2019s vendors are large national entities with dominant market presence in their respective fields. Their services could prove difficult to replace in a timely manner if a failure or other service interruption were to occur. Failures of certain vendors to provide contracted services could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to customers and cause the Company to incur significant expense.\nThe Company's ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may have a materially adverse effect on the Company's performance.\nThe Company\u2019s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense and certain of the Company\u2019s competitors have directly targeted its employees, including competitors who are outside of our geographic footprint offering work from home opportunities. The imposition on the Company or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. The Company\u2019s business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages; increased health care and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs; increased costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets; and increased wages, benefits and costs related to inflationary and other pressure on wages now being experienced. If the Company provides inadequate succession planning or is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Company\u2019s performance, including its competitive position, could have a materially adverse effect.\nExternal and Market-Related Risk\nRegional economic factors may have an adverse impact on the Company's business.\nThe Company's main markets are located in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Massachusetts. Most of the Company's customers are individuals and small and medium-sized businesses which are dependent upon the regional economy. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company's products and services as well as the ability of the Company's customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company's deposit funding sources. A prolonged economic downturn in these markets could negatively impact the Company.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nThe financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, quality customer service, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company\u2019s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nConditions in the insurance market could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nRevenue from insurance fees and commissions could be negatively affected by fluctuating premiums in the insurance markets or other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. Other factors that affect insurance revenue are the profitability and growth of the Company\u2019s clients, the renewal rate of the current insurance policies, continued development of new product and services as well as access to new markets. The Company\u2019s insurance revenues and profitability may also be adversely affected by new laws and regulatory developments impacting the healthcare and insurance markets.\nChanges in the equity markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for other fee-based services.\nEconomic downturns could affect the volume of income from and demand for fee-based services. Revenue from the wealth management and employee benefit trust businesses depends in large part on the level of assets under management and administration. Market volatility and the potential to lead customers to liquidate investments, as well as lower asset values, can reduce the level of assets under management and administration and thereby decrease the Company\u2019s investment management and employee benefit trust revenues.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other information could have a material adverse impact on business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill, other intangible assets and the investment portfolio.\nThe Company may be required to record impairment charges in respect to goodwill, other intangible assets and the investment portfolio. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for resale of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, the economic condition of state and local municipalities, adverse changes in the business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment or a decision to change the operations or dispose of an operating unit could have a negative effect on the investment portfolio, goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods.\nThe Company\u2019s financial statements are based, in part, on assumptions and estimates, which, if incorrect or conditions change, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including available-for-sale securities and certain loans, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Company\u2019s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Company may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company\u2019s financial statements are incorrect, it may experience material losses.\nRisk Related to Acquisition Activity\nAcquisition activity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and result of operations.\nThe business strategy of the Company includes growth through acquisition. Recently completed and future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include among other things: limitations on potential acquisition targets based upon regulatory restrictions, obtaining timely regulatory approval, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of the Company\u2019s ongoing business, the inability of the Company\u2019s management to maximize its financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, the potential that errors, omissions or circumstances existing prior to or at the time of the closing result in losses after the close, and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a company may deteriorate after the acquisition agreement is signed or after the acquisition closes.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was acquired primarily through whole-bank acquisitions and was not underwritten by the Company at origination.\nAt December 31, 2021, 14% of the loan portfolio was acquired and was not underwritten by the Company at origination, and therefore is not necessarily reflective of the Company\u2019s historical credit risk experience. The Company performed extensive credit due diligence prior to each acquisition and marked the loans to fair value upon acquisition, with such fair valuation considering expected credit losses that existed at the time of acquisition. However, there is a risk that credit losses could be larger than currently anticipated, thus adversely affecting earnings.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nSince COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by the macroeconomic impacts resulting from the efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic, including the introduction of new variants of COVID-19 and vaccination and other efforts to control the spread, the Company\u2019s revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage of its revenues in future periods may differ significantly from its historical rates, and its future operating results may fall below expectations.\nThe Company has experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for branch associates and administrative positions, including due to concerns around and illnesses arising from COVID-19 and its various variants and other factors, which could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. Such labor shortages could be further exacerbated by expanded federal, state and local COVID-19 vaccination requirements. In addition, the Company\u2019s wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent especially in a rising wage market.\nWith respect to the Company\u2019s loan portfolios, COVID-19 related business shutdowns and slowdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, variability in unemployment, increased inflation, increased commercial property vacancy rates, reduced profitability and ability for property owners to make mortgage payments, overall economic and financial market instability, and decreased consumer confidence, may negatively impact customers and cause the Company\u2019s customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments. The Company instituted a deferral program which granted customers impacted by COVID-19 deferrals of loan principal and/or interest payments provided that such customers met certain requirements. While certain deferrals are still ongoing, it is difficult to assess whether a customer will be able to perform under the original terms of the loan once the extended deferral period expires. New deferrals may be warranted if situations worsen. Once these deferrals expire, it may become apparent that more customers than expected are unable to perform and the Company may be required to classify these loans as nonaccrual, make additional provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs. If these deferrals were not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s customers, it will adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time.\nIn addition, the Company has participated as a lender in the first and second rounds of funding for the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d). There are heightened concerns associated with processing the initial and follow-up loan applications and the related forgiveness applications which expose the Company to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP, including the ambiguity in the laws, the rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, and the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all of the PPP loan guaranties.\nIn addition, the pandemic has also increased the likelihood that federal and state taxes may increase as a result of the effects of the pandemic on governmental budgets, which could reduce the Company\u2019s net income.\nGeneral Risks\nTrading activity in the Company\u2019s common stock could result in material price fluctuations.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 Changes in securities analysts\u2019 expectations of financial performance;\n\u2022 Volatility of stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022 Incorrect information or speculation;\n\u2022 Changes in industry valuations;\n\u2022 Variations in operating results from general expectations;\n\u2022 Actions taken against the Company by various regulatory agencies;\n\u2022 Changes in authoritative accounting guidance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022 Changes in general domestic economic conditions such as inflation rates, tax rates, unemployment rates, oil prices, labor and healthcare cost trend rates, recessions, and changing government policies, laws and regulations; and\n\u2022 Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events.", "PERMNO": 86896, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBU"}
