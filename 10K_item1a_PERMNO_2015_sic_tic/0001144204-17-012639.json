{"cik": "1437557", "company": "LILIS ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our shares of common stock involves significant risks, including the potential loss of all or part of your investment. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause a decline in the market price of our shares. You should carefully consider all of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you make an investment in our common stock. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement. Some of these important factors, but not necessarily all important factors, include the following:\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIf we are not able to access additional capital in significant amounts, we may not be able to develop our current prospects and properties, or we may forfeit our interest in certain prospects and we may not be able to continue to operate our business.\nWe need significant additional capital to continue to operate our properties and continue operations. Currently, a significant portion of our revenue after field level operating expenses is required to be paid to our lenders as debt service.\nIn the near term, we intend to finance our capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, sales of non-core property assets, future issuance of debt and/or equity securities and entry into a new credit facility. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7 our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7 the amount of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells;\n\u00b7 the prices at which we sell our production;\n\u00b7 the costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7 our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u00b7 the ability and willingness of banks to lend to us; and\n\u00b7 our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nOur operations and other capital resources may not provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2017 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include refinancing existing debt, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of non-core property assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable, or at all.\nIf we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or may be otherwise unable to implement their development plan, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. In addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings. The occurrence of such events may prevent us from continuing to operate our business and our common stock and preferred stock may not have any value.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may be required to seek additional financing to fund our 2017 capital budget. If we are unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or maintain adequate liquidity, our ability to fund our capital budget, replace our proved reserves or to maintain production levels and generate revenue will be limited.\nOur principal sources of liquidity historically have been equity contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, net cash provided by operating activities, and net proceeds from the issuance of Series A preferred and Series B preferred notes. Our capital program will require additional financing above the level of cash generated by our operations to fund growth. If our expected cash flow from operations decreases as a result of lower commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to expend the capital necessary to replace our proved reserves, maintain our leasehold acreage or maintain production may be limited, resulting in decreased production and proved reserves over time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources to fund our 2017 capital budget. Our liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, including our ability to access additional financing, and (ii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available or, if available, offered to us on acceptable terms. Given our existing debt and the estimated value of our proved reserves on December 31, 2016, we do not expect to have access to reserve-based revolving debt capacity during 2017. As a result, our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, dependent up our access to new equity and equity-linked capital. As a result, the adequacy of our capital resources is difficult to predict at this time\nOil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and have declined significantly from levels experienced in recent years. If commodity prices experience a further, substantial decline, our operations, financial condition, and level of expenditures for the development of our oil, NGL, and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, NGLs, and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, operating results, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth and carrying value of our properties. Oil, NGLs, and natural gas are commodities, and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the commodities markets have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. If the prices of oil, NGLs, and natural gas experience a further, substantial decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control and include the following:\n\u00b7 the level of global exploration and production;\n\u00b7 the level of global inventories;\n\u00b7 the ability and willingness of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u00b7 worldwide and regional economic conditions affecting the global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7 political and economic conditions in or affecting other producing countries, including conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u00b7 prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices;\n\u00b7 the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u00b7 localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\u2028weather conditions and other natural disasters;\u2028technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7 the price and availability of alternative fuels;\u2028expectations about future commodity prices; and\u2028domestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower commodity prices may reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves as existing reserves are depleted. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the amount of oil, NGLs, and natural gas that we can produce economically, and a significant portion of our exploitation, development and exploration projects could become uneconomic. This may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, if commodity prices remain depressed for a lengthy period of time or experience a further substantial or extended decline, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or ability to finance planned capital expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOn September 29, 2016, we entered into the Credit Agreement that provides for a three-year senior secured term loan with an aggregate principal amount of $31.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016, and $38.1 million outstanding as of March 1, 2017. We may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $50 million under the Credit Agreement. Our degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7 it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, further exploration, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u00b7 a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u00b7 the debt service requirements of other indebtedness in the future could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u00b7 we could be vulnerable to any downturn in general economic conditions and in our business, and we could be unable to carry out capital spending and exploration activities that are currently planned; and\n\u00b7 we may from time to time be out of compliance with covenants under our debt agreements, which will require us to seek waivers from our lenders, which may be difficult to obtain.\nWe may incur additional debt, including secured indebtedness, or issue preferred stock in order to maintain adequate liquidity and develop and acquire properties to the extent desired. A higher level of indebtedness and/or preferred stock increases the risk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, natural gas and oil prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets, the number of shares of capital stock we have authorized, unissued and unreserved and our performance at the time we need capital.\nThe Credit Agreement, guaranteed and further secured by substantially all our assets, contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\nThe Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7 create additional liens;\n\u00b7 sell certain of our assets;\n\u00b7 merge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u00b7 pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u00b7 engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7 enter into certain swap agreements.\nThe requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nWe may from time to time enter into alternative or additional debt agreements that contain covenant restrictions that may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, may require us to sell assets or take other actions to reduce indebtedness to meet such covenants, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not detect errors or potential acts of fraud.\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls will prevent all possible errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are being met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls are evaluated relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of our controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its intended goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur without detection.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement Section 404, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we are required to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on framework of internal control issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThrough September 30, 2016, management had concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed our remediation efforts, but we may discover additional areas of our internal control over financial reporting in the future which may require improvement. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nIf oil or natural gas prices decrease or exploration and development efforts are unsuccessful, wells in progress are deemed unsuccessful, or major tracts of undeveloped acreage expire, or other similar adverse events occur, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our developed properties.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool. These costs include land acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenses, carrying charges on non-producing properties, costs of drilling wells, completing productive wells, or plugging and abandoning non-productive wells, costs related to expired leases, or leases underlying producing and non-producing wells, and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities. Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and natural gas property that comprise the full cost pool, less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves. This ceiling test is performed at least quarterly. Should the capitalized costs of the full cost pool exceed this ceiling, we would recognize an impairment expense. We recognized an impairment expense of approximately $4.7 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s estimates of undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the carrying amounts were not expected to be recovered due to a decrease in proved reserves. During 2016, commodity prices continued to trade in a low range. With low commodity prices sustained for the majority of 2016 in the DJ Basin, some of our properties became uneconomic triggering impairment charge of $4.7 million at December 31, 2016. The impairment charge of $24.5 million in 2015 was due to the lower commodity prices and lack of capital to develop our undeveloped oil and gas properties. Future write-downs could occur for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to continued reductions in oil and gas prices that lower the estimate of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves, revisions to reserve estimates, or from the addition of non-productive capitalized costs to the full cost pool that do not result in corresponding increase in oil and gas reserves. Impairments of plugging and abandonment of wells in progress are other areas where costs may be capitalized into the full cost pool, without any corresponding increase in reserve values; as such, these situations could result in future additional impairment expenses.\nIf commodity prices stay at current levels or decline further, we could incur full cost ceiling impairments in future quarters. Because the ceiling calculation uses rolling 12-month average commodity prices, the effect of lower quarter-over-quarter prices in 2016 compared to 2015 is a lower ceiling value each quarter. This may result in ongoing impairments each quarter until prices stabilize or improve. Impairment charges would not affect cash flow from operating activities, but would adversely affect our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNo one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.\nIn order to prepare estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures and analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by independent reserve engineers, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nFurther, the present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves may not be the current market value of estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the 12-month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the un-weighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties.\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we used when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the FASB in Accounting Standards Codification, which is referred to as ASC 932 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile, and our revenue, profitability, cash flow, future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital, as well as the carrying value of our properties, are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas.\nHistorically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7 changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u00b7 the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 acts of war or terrorism;\n\u00b7 political conditions and events, including embargoes, affecting oil-producing activity;\n\u00b7 the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u00b7 the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7 weather conditions;\n\u00b7 technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7 the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7 market concerns about global warming or changes in governmental policies and regulations due to climate change initiatives.\nVolatile oil and natural gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and often cause disruption in the market for oil and natural gas producing properties, as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability and future rate of growth depend primarily upon the prices we receive for oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas that we sell. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. In addition, we may need to record asset carrying value write-downs if prices fall. A significant decline in the prices of natural gas or oil could adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains or result in losses.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, from time to time, we may enter into derivative contracts that economically hedge our oil and gas price on a portion of our production. These contracts may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the contract. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u00b7 there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received;\n\u00b7 our production and/or sales of oil or natural gas are less than expected;\n\u00b7 payments owed under derivative hedging contracts come due prior to receipt of the hedged month\u2019s production revenue; or\n\u00b7 the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations.\nHedging transactions we may enter into may not adequately protect us from declines in the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition, the counterparties under any future derivatives contracts may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. As of December 31, 2016, we had no hedging agreements in place.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of our drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of future multi-year drilling activities on existing acreage. These scheduled drilling locations represent a significant component of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations previously identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas is a speculative activity and involves numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs that could adversely affect us.\nOur success will depend on the success of our drilling program. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. Analogies drawn from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to current drilling prospects.\nThe budgeted costs of planning, drilling, completing and operating wells are often exceeded and such costs can increase significantly due to various complications that may arise during the drilling and operating processes. Before a well is spud, we may incur significant geological and geophysical (seismic) costs, which are incurred whether a well eventually produces commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, or is drilled at all. Exploration wells endure a much greater risk of loss than development wells. If actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than the current estimated costs, we may not be able to continue operations as proposed and could be forced to modify drilling plans accordingly. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be discovered. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 unexpected or adverse drilling conditions;\n\u00b7 elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u00b7 equipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7 adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7 compliance with governmental requirements; and\n\u00b7 shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, crews, and equipment.\nIf we decide to drill a certain location, there is a risk that (i) no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found or produced, or (ii) we may drill or participate in new wells that are not productive or drill wells that are productive, but that do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. A productive well may become uneconomical if water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil and/or natural gas from the well. Our overall drilling success rate or drilling success rate for activity within a particular project area may decline. Unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in production and revenues and materially harm operations and financial condition by reducing available cash and resources. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon-bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production and reserves from the well or abandonment of the well.\nFinancial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers, third party operators or other third parties could decrease cash flow from operations and adversely affect exploration and development activities.\nWe derive essentially all of our revenues from the sale of our oil and natural gas to unaffiliated third party purchasers, independent marketing companies and mid-stream companies. Any delays in payments from such purchasers caused by financial problems encountered by them will have an immediate negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nLiquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our working interest co-owners or the third-party operators of our non-operated properties may prevent or delay the drilling of a well or the development of a project. Our working interest co-owners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the case of a working interest owner, we could be required to pay the working interest owner\u2019s share of the project costs.\nProspects in which we decide to participate may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities or quantities sufficient to meet our targeted rate of return.\nA prospect is a property in which we own an interest and contains what we believe, based on available reservoir, seismic and/or geological information, to be indications of commercial oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to be drilled to a prospect that will require substantial additional technical assessment, data acquisition and/or seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no definitive method to predict in advance of drilling and testing and wider-scale development whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. The use of reservoir, geologic and seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. The analysis we perform using data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be useful in predicting the characteristics and potential reserves associated with our drilling prospects.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our performance, including our ability to participate in ready to drill prospects in our core areas.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to capital, the principle resources necessary for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are:\n\u00b7 leasehold prospects under which oil and natural gas reserves may be discovered;\n\u00b7 drilling rigs and related equipment to explore for such reserves; and\n\u00b7 knowledge personnel to conduct all phases of oil and natural gas operations.\nWe must compete for such resources with both major oil and natural gas companies and independent operators. Virtually all of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Such capital, materials and resources may not be available when needed. If we are unable to access capital, material and resources when needed, we risk suffering numerous consequences, including:\n\u00b7 the breach of our obligations under the oil and gas leases by which we hold our prospects and the potential loss of those leasehold interests;\n\u00b7 loss of reputation in the oil and gas community;\n\u00b7 inability to retain staff or attract capital;\n\u00b7 a general slowdown in our operations and decline in revenue; and\n\u00b7 decline in market price of our common stock.\nSeismic studies do not guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or, if present, will produce in economic quantities.\nWe may use seismic studies to assist with assessing prospective drilling opportunities on current properties, as well as on properties that we may acquire. Such seismic studies are merely an interpretive tool and do not necessarily guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or if present will produce in economic quantities.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce oil or natural gas as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them, which could cause us to incur losses.\nOne of our growth strategies is to pursue selective acquisitions of undeveloped acreage potentially containing oil and natural gas reserves. If we choose to pursue an acquisition, we will perform a review of the target properties; however, these reviews are inherently incomplete as they are based on the quality, availability and interpretation of the reviewed data, the acumen and the assumptions of the evaluation personnel. Generally, it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property, well, facility and/or file involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. We may not perform an inspection on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we may not be able to obtain effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems, and we may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the acquired properties. If we acquire properties with risks or liabilities that were unknown or not assessed correctly, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected as claims are settled and cleanup costs related to these liabilities are incurred.\nWe may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest.\nIf an examination of the title history of a property that we purchased reveals an oil and natural gas lease has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired, our interest would be worthless. In such an instance, the amount paid for such oil and natural gas lease as well as any royalties paid pursuant to the terms of the lease prior to the discovery of the title defect would be lost.\nPrior to the drilling of an oil and natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in the oil and natural gas industry the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit within which the proposed oil and natural gas well is to be drilled to ensure there are no obvious deficiencies in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Failure to cure any title defects may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. In the future, we may suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, unproved and unevaluated acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur producing properties and operations are located in a limited number of geographic areas, which exposes us to various risks, including the risk of damage or business interruptions from natural disasters or weather events.\nAll of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016, all of our 2016 and 2015 sales were generated in the Delaware Basin in Winkler and Loving Counties, West Texas and Lea County, New Mexico and the DJ Basin in southeastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado and southwestern Nebraska.\nAlthough these areas are well-established oilfield infrastructures, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area.\nIn addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and gas producing areas, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operational risk is concentrated due to our reliance on a small number of wells, operators and oil and gas purchasers.\nWe have concentrated operational risks both in terms of producing oil and gas properties, the operators we use and in the purchasers of our oil and gas production. An operational failure by an operator, the decline of production from a property and the termination of a contractual agreement with an operator or purchaser could have a material negative impact on our company. Our properties are located in areas where we have multiple markets for our oil and gas. As such, the loss of any single purchaser will not have a material impact with our ability to sell our oil and gas.\nWe will not be the operator on all of our drilling locations, and, therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non-operated assets.\nCurrently, we are the operator of our Delaware assets, but do not control all our DJ Basin development. As we carry out our exploration and development programs, we may enter into arrangements with respect to existing or future drilling locations that result in a greater proportion of locations being operated by others. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling locations operated by our partners. Dependence on the operator could prevent us from realizing target returns for those locations. The success and timing of exploration and development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7 the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7 the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7 approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u00b7 selection of technology; and\n\u00b7 the rate of production of reserves, if any.\nThis limited ability to exercise control over the operations of some of drilling locations may cause a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control.\nThe marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, rail service, and processing facilities in addition to competing oil and gas production available to third-party purchasers. We deliver crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through trucking, gathering systems and pipelines, some of which we do not own. The lack of availability of capacity on third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reliability or other reasons, including adverse weather conditions or work-loads. Activist or other efforts may delay or halt the construction of additional pipelines or facilities. Third-party systems and facilities may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay production, thereby harming our business and, in turn, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur success is influenced by oil, natural gas, and NGL prices in the specific areas where we operate, and these prices may be lower than prices at major markets.\nRegional natural gas, condensate, oil and NGLs prices may move independently of broad industry price trends. Because some of our operations are located outside major markets, we are directly impacted by regional prices regardless of Henry Hub, WTI or other major market pricing.\nUnless we find new oil and gas reserves to replace actual production, our reserves and production will decline, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates and depletion that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics subsurface and surface pressures and other factors. Thus, our future oil and gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and revenue are highly dependent on our success in efficiently obtaining additional reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire reserves to replace our current and future production at costs or other terms acceptable to us, or at all, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging unconventional shale plays using available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned exploratory and development drilling in these plays are subject to drilling and completion execution risks and drilling results may not meet our economic expectations for reserves or production. As a result, we may incur material write-downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nUnconventional operations involve utilizing drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, not reaching the desired objective due to drilling problems, not landing our wellbore in the desired drilling zone or specific target, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the wellbore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, mechanical integrity, being able to hydraulic fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations, proper design and engineering versus reservoir parameters, and successfully cleaning out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nOur experience with horizontal well applications utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques specifically in the formations where we are currently operating is limited; however, we contract with local experts in the area to design, plan and conduct our drilling and completion operations. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be developed over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material write-downs of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment supplies or personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans.\nThe oil and gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there are shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of and demand for rigs, equipment and supplies may increase substantially and their availability may be limited. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified personnel, including drilling rig crews, may rise as the number of rigs in service increases. The higher prices of oil and gas during the last several years have increased activity which has resulted in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, which have resulted in increased costs and delays in the areas where we operate. If drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel are unavailable to us due to excessive costs or demand or otherwise, our ability to execute our exploration and development plans could be materially and adversely affected and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTerrorist attacks aimed at energy operations could adversely affect our business.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other government action have led and may lead to further increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect these commodity markets or the financial markets used by us. In addition, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected oil and natural gas operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack on our facilities, customer facilities, the infrastructure depended upon for transportation of products, and, in some cases, those of other energy companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks.\nOur operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:\n\u00b7 fire, explosions and blowouts;\n\u00b7 negligence of personnel;\n\u00b7 inclement weather;\n\u00b7 pipe or equipment failure;\n\u00b7 abnormally pressured formations; and\n\u00b7 environmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas environment (including groundwater contamination).\nThese events may result in substantial losses to our company from:\n\u00b7 injury or loss of life;\n\u00b7 significantly increased costs;\n\u00b7 severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7 pollution or other environmental damage;\n\u00b7 clean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7 regulatory investigation;\n\u00b7 penalties and suspension of operations; or\n\u00b7 attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these losses or liabilities. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nThe producing wells in which we have an interest occasionally experience reduced or terminated production. These curtailments can result from mechanical failures, contract terms, pipeline and processing plant interruptions, market conditions, operator priorities, and weather conditions. These curtailments can last from a few days to many months, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks faced and operators of prospects in which we participate may not maintain or may fail to obtain adequate insurance.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses in order to protect against the risks faced. We do not carry business interruption insurance. We may elect not to carry insurance if management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The impact of natural disasters or weather events in the areas where we operate has resulted in escalating insurance costs and less favorable coverage terms.\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to particular hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and natural gas, such as blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires and pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operation. We do not operate all of the properties in which we hold an interest. In the projects in which we own a non-operating interest directly, the operator for the prospect maintains insurance of various types to cover operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry. We believe the coverage and types of insurance are adequate. The occurrence of a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance could result in the loss of our total investment in a particular prospect which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information, or damage to our reputation. A system failure or data security breach could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in the industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we are in a position to do so. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies used now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, the business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have limited management and staff and will be dependent upon partnering arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had nineteen full-time employees and two part-time employees. We leverage the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including engineering, oil and gas well planning and supervision, and land, legal, environmental and tax services. We also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation and prospect leasing. Our dependence on third-party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed; and\n\u00b7 the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects.\nIf we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may suffer with the loss of key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel, including Abraham Mirman, our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers and key employees. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties, marketing oil and natural gas production and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on operations. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel.\nWe have an active board of directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately involved in the business and the determination of various operational strategies. Members of our board of directors work closely with management to identify potential prospects, acquisitions and areas for further development. If any directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nOur business strategy is based on our ability to acquire additional reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u00b7 recoverable reserves;\n\u00b7 future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u00b7 well and facility integrity;\n\u00b7 development and operating cost;\n\u00b7 regulatory constraints and plans; and\n\u00b7 potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nSignificant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u00b7 diversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u00b7 challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u00b7 difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u00b7 challenge of attracting and retaining capable personnel associated with acquired operations; and\n\u00b7 failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within the expected time frame.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management and other staff may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management and staff are not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant growth in the size and scope of our operations would place a strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial staff and control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, geologists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan.\nWe may face difficulties in securing and operating under authorizations and permits to drill, complete or operate our wells.\nThe recent growth in oil and gas exploration in the United States has drawn intense scrutiny from environmental and community interest groups, regulatory agencies and other governmental entities. As a result, we may face significant opposition to, or increased regulation of, our operations, that may make it difficult or impossible to obtain permits and other needed authorizations to drill, complete or operate, result in operational delays, or otherwise make oil and gas exploration more costly or difficult than in other countries.\nOur producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nMost of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.\nOur operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas, an area in which industry activity has remained relatively steady despite the recent downturn in commodity prices. As a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has continued to be competitive, and would be expected to increase substantially in the future if commodity prices rebound. Moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer.\nAny delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could result in oil and gas production volumes being below our forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. However, Texas has endured severe drought conditions over the past several years. These drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to produce oil and natural gas economically, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Gas Industry\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas.\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA, under the Clean Air Act, has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. Relatively recently, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, including petroleum refineries, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities.\nAlso, on May 12, 2016, EPA issued regulations (effective August 2, 2016) that build on the 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart OOOO (NSPS OOOO) standards by directly regulating methane and VOC emissions from various types of new and modified oil and gas sources. Some of those sources are already regulated under NSPS OOOO, while others, like hydraulically fractured oil wells, pneumatic pumps, and certain equipment and components at compressor stations, are covered for the first time. On March 10, 2016, moreover, the EPA announced that it is moving towards issuing performance standards for methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. The agency said that it will \u201cbegin with a formal process (i.e., an Information Collection Request) to require companies operating existing oil and gas sources to provide information to assist in the development of comprehensive regulations to reduce methane emissions.\u201d On November 10, 2016, the EPA issued the Information Collection Request (\u201cICR\u201d) and explained that \u201c[r]ecipients of the operator survey (also referred to as Part 1) will have 60 days after receiving the ICR to complete the survey and submit it to EPA\u2026.Recipients of the more detailed facility survey (also referred to as Part 2) will have 180 days after receiving the ICR to complete that survey and submit it to the agency.\u201d\nIn June 2014, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA upheld a portion of EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) stationary source permitting program, but also invalidated a portion of it. The Court held that stationary sources already subject to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) or Title V permitting programs for non-GHG criteria pollutants remain subject to GHG Best Available Control Technology and major source permitting requirements, but ruled that sources cannot be subject to the PSD or Title V major source permitting programs based solely on GHG emission levels. As a result, on August 12, 2015, the EPA eliminated from its PSD and Title V regulations the provisions that subjected sources to the PSD or Title V programs based solely on GHG emission levels. The EPA likewise said that it will \u201cfurther revise the PSD and Title V regulations in a separate rulemaking to fully implement\u201d the Utility Air Regulatory Group judgment. On October 3, 2016, EPA published a proposed rulemaking for that purpose. The Utility Air Regulatory Group judgment does not prevent states from considering and adopting state-only major source permitting requirements based solely on GHG emission levels.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce GHG emissions and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these GHG cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, NGLs, and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production by providing and linking up induced flow paths for the oil and/or gas contained in the rocks. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA, under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel.\nThe Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d), on March 20, 2015, issued its final regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands. The new regulations require, among other things, disclosure of chemicals, annulus pressure monitoring, flow back and produced water management and storage, and more stringent well integrity measures associated with hydraulic fracturing operations on public land. On June 21, 2016, however, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming enjoined BLM from enforcing the regulations, concluding that the agency lacked the authority to issue them. BLM appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The appeal is pending.\nIn addition, on June 13, 2016, under the Clean Water Act, the EPA finalized a rule (effective August 29, 2016) that prohibits the discharge of oil and gas wastewaters to publicly-owned treatment works.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nWhile these state and local land use restrictions generally cover areas with little recent or ongoing oil and gas development, they could lead opponents of hydraulic fracturing to push for similar statewide regimes. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nA number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA, for example, recently completed a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. In June of 2015, the EPA released an \u201cexternal review draft\u201d of the study and, in it, said that shale development had not led to \u201cwidespread, systemic\u201d problems with groundwater. On August 11, 2016, however, the EPA Science Advisory Board issued comments on the external review draft, finding that \u201cthe EPA did not support quantitatively its conclusion about lack of evidence for widespread, systemic impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, and did not clearly describe the system(s) of interest (e.g., groundwater, surface water), the scale of impacts (i.e., local or regional), nor the definitions of \u2018systemic\u2019 and \u2018widespread.\u2019\u201d In December of 2016, the EPA released the final version of the study, finding, among other things, that there are \u201ccertain conditions under which impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities can be more frequent or severe,\u201d including \u201c[i]njection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, allowing gases or liquids to move to groundwater resources.\u201d These types of studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nThe EPA also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and undertook a public participation process under the Toxic Substances Control Act to seek comment on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and the mechanisms for obtaining this information. Additionally, on January 7, 2015, several national environmental advocacy groups filed a lawsuit requesting that the EPA add the oil and gas extraction industry to the list of industries required to report releases of certain \u201ctoxic chemicals\u201d under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act\u2019s Toxics Release Inventory, or TRI, program. On October 22, 2015, the EPA took action on the Environmental Integrity Project\u2019s October 24, 2012 petition to impose TRI reporting requirements on various oil and gas facilities. The EPA granted the petition in part, by agreeing to propose to add natural gas processing facilities to the scope of the TRI program, but rejected the rest of the petition. On December 15, 2015, in light of that decision, the environmental advocacy groups that had commenced the lawsuit opted to voluntarily dismiss it. On January 6, 2017, EPA issued a proposed rulemaking that would add natural gas processing facilities to the scope of the TRI program.\nCurrent water regulation relating to hydraulic fracturing, particularly water source and groundwater regulation, could result in increased operational costs, operating restrictions and delays.\nHydraulic fracturing uses large amounts of water. It can require between three to five million gallons of water per horizontal well. We may face regulatory concerns in both the sourcing and the discharge of water used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition, hydraulic fracturing produces water discharges that must be treated and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nFirst, as to sourcing water for hydraulic fracturing, we will need to secure water from the local water supply or make alternative arrangements. In order to source water from the local water supply for hydraulic fracturing we may need to pay premium rates and be subject to a lower priority if the local area becomes subject to water restrictions. We may also seek water from alternative providers supporting the hydraulic fracturing industry. If we have an insufficient water supply, we will be unable to engage in hydraulic fracturing until such supply is located.\nSecond, hydraulic fracturing results in water discharges that must be treated and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing may increase operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on operations and financial performance. Our ability to remove and dispose of water will affect production, and the cost of water treatment and disposal may affect profitability. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could also include restrictions on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing or disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other substances associated with the exploration, development and production of gas and oil.\nFuture legislation may result in the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Additionally, future federal or state legislation may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction.\nPotential legislation, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal and state income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, legislation could be enacted that increases the taxes states impose on oil and natural gas extraction.\nMoreover, as part of the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2017, there was a proposal to impose an \u201coil fee\u201d of $10.25 on a per barrel equivalent of crude oil. This fee would be collected on domestically produced and imported petroleum products. The fee would be phased in evenly over five years, beginning October 1, 2016. The adoption of this, or similar proposals, could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn could affect the prices we receive for our oil. Any of these tax changes could have a material impact on our financial performance.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, production and sale of oil and natural gas, and operating safety. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may result in substantial penalties and harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, such as:\n\u00b7 land use restrictions;\n\u00b7 lease permit restrictions;\n\u00b7 drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements, such as plugging and abandonment bonds;\n\u00b7 spacing of wells;\n\u00b7 unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u00b7 safety precautions;\n\u00b7 operational reporting; and\n\u00b7 taxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u00b7 personal injuries;\n\u00b7 property and natural resource damages;\n\u00b7 well reclamation cost; and\n\u00b7 governmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. It is also possible that a portion of our oil and gas properties could be subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings for which we may not be adequately compensated. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d for a more detailed description of regulatory laws covering our business.\nOur operations may incur substantial expenses and resulting liabilities from compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u00b7 require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or facility mobilization and commissioning, or injection or disposal commences;\n\u00b7 restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production and processing activities, including environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells;\n\u00b7 limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and\n\u00b7 impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u00b7 the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u00b7 incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations; and\n\u00b7 the imposition of injunctive relief.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to reach and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were performed. Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages. See \u201cBusiness- Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d for a more detailed description of the environmental laws covering our business.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable regulatory agency administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission has regulations intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry with authority to fine violators of the regulations civil penalties of up to $1 million per day, and the CFTC prohibits market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC, including similar anti-manipulation authority with respect to crude oil swaps and futures contracts as that granted to the CFTC with respect to crude oil purchases and sales. The CFTC rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, as described in \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur common stock may be subject to penny stock rules which limit the market for our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock likely qualify as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the SEC rules. Sales and purchases of \u201cpenny stock\u201d generally require more disclosures by broker-dealers and satisfaction of other administrative requirements. As a result, broker-dealers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock and an active trading market or a specific share price may not be established or maintained.\nOn May 26, 2016, our common stock was suspended from trading on the Nasdaq and immediately began trading on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace, or the OTCQB. On July 29, 2016, the Nasdaq announced that it will delist our common stock and file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Form 25 was subsequently filed on August 1, 2016, and the delisting became effective on August 11, 2016. We have applied for relisting on the Nasdaq and are working to show full compliance with all applicable Nasdaq initial listing criteria.\nWhile our common stock trades on the OTCQB, trading activity in our common stock generally occurs in small volumes each day. The value of our common stock could be affected by:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 the market price for crude oil;\n\u00b7 changes in the market valuations of other oil and gas companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u00b7 actions taken by our lenders or the holders of our convertible debentures;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 conditions or trends in the market in which we operate;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet financial analysts\u2019 performance expectations; and\n\u00b7 other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn a volatile market, you may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may have an extremely negative effect on the market price of our common stock and may prevent you from obtaining a market price equal to your purchase price when you attempt to sell our common stock in the open market. In these situations, you may be required either to sell at a market price which is lower than your purchase price, or to hold our common stock for a longer period of time than you planned. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or oil and gas properties by using our common stock as consideration.\nIf an orderly and active trading market for our securities does not develop or is not sustained, the value and liquidity of your investment in our securities could be adversely affected.\nAn active or liquid market in our common stock or securities exercisable or convertible for our common stock does not currently exist and might not develop or, if it does develop, it might not be sustainable. The last reported sale price of our common stock on the OTCQB on March 1, 2017 was $4.00 per share. The historic bid and ask quotations for our common stock, however, should not be viewed as an indicator of the current or historical market price for our common stock nor as an indicator of the market price for our common stock if our common stock were to be listed on a national securities exchange. The offering price for our securities as issued by us from time to time is determined through discussions between us and the prospective investor(s), with reference to the most recent closing price of our common stock on the OTCQB, and may vary from the market price of our securities following any offering. Further, our trading volume on the OTCQB has been generally very limited.\nIf an active public market for our common stock develops, we expect the market price may be volatile, which may depress the market price of our securities and result in substantial losses to investors if they are unable to sell their securities at or above their purchase price.\nIf an active public market for our common stock develops, we expect the market price of our securities to fluctuate substantially for the foreseeable future, primarily due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 our status as a company with a limited operating history and limited revenues to date, which may make risk-averse investors more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the shares of a seasoned issuer in the event of negative news or lack of progress;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our existing or future competitors;\n\u00b7 the timing and development of our products;\n\u00b7 general and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 liquidity;\n\u00b7 actions by our stockholders;\n\u00b7 changes in our cash flow from operations or earnings estimates;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 our capital commitments; and\n\u00b7 the loss of any of our key management personnel.\nIn addition, market prices of the securities of energy companies, particularly companies like ours without consistent revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future, some of which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Further, our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB, which is often characterized by low trading volume and by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. The availability of buyers and sellers represented by this volatility could lead to a market price for our common stock that is unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities quoted on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national securities exchange like The NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange. While we are currently seeking to list our securities on a national securities exchange, there is no assurance we will be able to do so, and if we do so, many of these same forces and limitations may still impact our trading volumes and market price in the near term. Additionally, the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of common stock into the market may also have a significant impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience high volatility in the market price of their securities. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may issue shares of our preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights. We currently have two series of preferred stock issued and outstanding, both of which provide its holders with a liquidation preference and prohibit the payment of dividends on junior securities, including our Common Stock, amongst other preferences and rights.\nThere may be future dilution of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of derivative securities outstanding, which upon exercise or conversion, would result in substantial dilution. For example, the conversion of the remaining Series B preferred stock in full could result in the issuance of 15,454,545 shares of common stock, and the exercise of outstanding warrants could result in the issuance of 15,915,511 shares of common stock. To the extent outstanding restricted stock units, warrants or options to purchase our common stock under our employee and director stock option plans are exercised, the price vesting triggers under the performance shares granted to our executive officers are satisfied, or additional shares of restricted stock are issued to our employees, holders of our Common Stock will experience dilution. Furthermore, if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, such sales could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends with respect to our common stock, and we do not expect to pay any dividends, in cash or otherwise, in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings for use in our business. In addition, our Credit Agreement prohibits us from paying any dividends and the indenture governing our senior notes restricts our ability to pay dividends. In the future, we may agree to further restrictions. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage of our shares or may issue negative reports, which may adversely affect the trading price of the shares.\nSecurities analysts may not provide research reports on our company. If securities analysts do not cover our company, this lack of coverage may adversely affect the trading price of our shares. The trading market for our shares will rely in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our shares, the trading price of our shares may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn, could also cause the trading price of our shares to decline. Further, because of our small market capitalization, it may be difficult for us to attract securities analysts to cover our company, which could significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our shares.\nOur Series B preferred stock accrues a dividend, and we may be required to issue additional shares of Series B preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events.\nThe Series B preferred stock accrues a dividend, payable quarterly in arrears (based on calendar quarters), in the amount of 6% per annum of the original issuance price of the Series B preferred stock. The dividend is payable by an increase to the stated value of the Series B preferred stock or in-kind in Series B preferred stock or in cash, at our election.\nWe may not have sufficient available cash to pay the dividends as it accrues. The payment of the dividends, or our failure to timely pay the dividends when due, could reduce our available cash on hand, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cause the value of our stock to decline in value. Additionally, any increase in stated value, which would result in the issuance of additional shares of Series B preferred stock in lieu of cash dividends (and the subsequent conversion of such Series B preferred stock into common stock pursuant to the terms of such Series B preferred stock) could cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our common stock.\nThe issuance and sale of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and the exercise of warrants received in those transactions, may depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf conversions of the Series B preferred stock and exercises of warrants received in those transactions, sales of such converted securities take place, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, the common stock issuable upon conversion of such securities may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of our company\u2019s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which shareholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb converted shares sold by the Series B preferred stock holders, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of our company.\nThough not now, in the future we may become subject to Nevada\u2019s control share law. A corporation is subject to Nevada\u2019s control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a \u201ccontrolling interest\u201d which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.\nThe effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law. If control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder\u2019s shares. Nevada\u2019s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation.\nIn addition to the control share law, Nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years after the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the corporation\u2019s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation\u2019s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders. The effect of Nevada\u2019s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of our company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 13113, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LLEXQ"}
