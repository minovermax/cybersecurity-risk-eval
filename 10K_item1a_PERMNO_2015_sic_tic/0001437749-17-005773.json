{"cik": "319458", "company": "Enservco Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s securities are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk, including among other items the risk factors described below. The below risk factors are intended to generally describe certain risks that could materially affect the Company and its current business operations and activities.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere herein in connection with any decision whether to acquire, hold or sell the Company\u2019s securities. The following list identifies and briefly summarizes certain risk but should not be viewed as complete or comprehensive. If any of the contingencies discussed in the following paragraphs or other materially adverse events actually occur, the business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a significant part of your investment.\nOperations Related Risks\nOur business may be materially impacted by seasonal weather conditions.\nOur businesses, particularly our frac heating and hot oil services, can be impacted by weather conditions and temperatures. Unseasonably warm weather during winter months can reduce demand for the heating services and result in higher operating costs due to need to retain equipment operators during these low demand periods. The Company has experienced unseasonably warm weather during parts of its heating season during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, which has impacted well enhancement service revenues and profits. Management makes concerted efforts to reduce costs during these low demand periods by utilizing operators in other business segments, reducing hours, and some instances utilizing seasonal layoffs.\nFurther, during the winter months, our customers may delay operations or we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations during periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, and during the spring some areas impose transportation restrictions due to the muddy conditions caused by the spring thaws.\nWe may be unable to implement price increases or maintain existing prices on our core services.\nWe periodically seek to increase the prices of our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders. Currently, the prices we are able to charge for our services and the demand for our services are depressed. We operate in a very competitive industry and, as a result, we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new equipment may enter the market, which would also put pressure on the pricing of our services. Even when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset rising costs. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our prices or to increase the prices of our services to offset rising costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry. We may not be able to finance future growth of our operations or future acquisitions.\nOur business activities require substantial capital expenditures. If our cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our existing credit facility were not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we would be required to reduce these expenditures or to fund these expenditures through new debt or equity issuances.\nOur ability to raise new debt or equity capital or to refinance or restructure our debt at any given time depends, among other things, on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Also, the terms of existing or future debt or equity instruments could further restrict our business operations. The inability to finance future growth could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers could hurt our operations.\nCompanies in our industry, including us, are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled workers. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide our customers with the highest quality service. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, and which can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. Labor costs may increase in the future or we may not be able to reduce wages when demand and pricing falls, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced a high employee turnover rate. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding workers could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that the high turnover rate in our industry is attributable to the nature of oilfield services work, which is physically demanding and performed outdoors, and to the seasonality of certain of our segments. As a result, workers may choose to pursue employment in areas that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. The potential inability or lack of desire by workers to commute to our facilities and job sites, as well as the competition for workers from competitors or other industries, are factors that could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. We may not be able to recruit, train and retain an adequate number of workers to replace departing workers. The inability to maintain an adequate workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation\u2019s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of the corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by the corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating losses, or NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the corporation\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If we were to experience an \"ownership change,\" this could result in increased U.S. federal income tax liability for us if we generate taxable income after the ownership change. Limitations on the use of NOLs and other tax attributes could also increase our state tax liabilities. The use of our tax attributes will also be limited to the extent that we do not generate positive taxable income in future tax periods. As a result of these limitations, we may be unable to offset future taxable income, if any, with NOLs before such NOLs expire. Accordingly, these limitations may increase our federal and state income tax liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $15.7 million and state NOLs of approximately $14.8 million.\nOur business depends on domestic (United States) spending by the crude oil and natural gas industry which has suffered significant negative price volatility since July 2014, and such volatility may continue; our business has been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 ability and willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas in the United States. Customers\u2019 expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as the availability of capital for operating and capital expenditures, may cause them to curtail spending, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment. Major declines in oil and natural gas prices since July 2014 (when prices were at approximately $100 per barrel) have resulted in substantial declines in capital spending and drilling programs across the industry. As a result of the declines in oil and natural gas prices, most exploration and production companies shut down or substantially reduced drilling programs and required service providers to make pricing concessions. Over the two years ended December 31, 2016, the Company has offered pricing concessions to a number of customers. Typically, these concessions have been made with the intent to maintain existing service volumes and/or develop additional business.\nIndustry conditions and specifically the market price for crude oil and natural gas are influenced by numerous domestic and global factors over which the Company has no control, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, weather conditions, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries, and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the consequent impact on commodity prices as well as exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and activity by some of our customers. Where declining prices lead to reduced exploration and development activities in the Company\u2019s market areas, the reduction in exploration and development activities also may have a negative long-term impact on the Company\u2019s business. Continued decline in oil and natural gas prices may result in increased pressure from our customers to make additional pricing concessions in the future and may impact our borrowing arrangements with our principal bank. There can be no assurance that the prices we charge to our customers will return to former levels.\nThere has also been significant political pressures for the United States economy to reduce its dependence on crude oil and natural gas due to the perceived impacts on climate change. Furthermore there have been significant political and regulatory efforts to reduce or eliminate hydraulic fracturing operations in certain of the Company\u2019s service areas, particularly in Colorado. These activities may make oil and gas investment and production less attractive.\nHigher oil and gas prices do not necessarily result in increased drilling activity because our customers\u2019 expectation of future prices also drives demand for drilling services. Oil and gas prices, as well as demand for the Company\u2019s services, also depend upon other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nSupply and demand for crude oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\npolitical pressures against crude oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u25cf\ncost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nexpectations regarding future energy prices;\n\u25cf\nadvancements in exploration and development technology;\n\u25cf\nadoption or repeal of laws regulating oil and gas production in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nimposition or lifting of economic sanctions against foreign companies;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions;\n\u25cf\nrate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\ntax policy regarding the oil and gas industry;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment and use of alternative energy sources; and\n\u25cf\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain external capital for projects and production operations.\nOngoing volatility and uncertainty in the domestic and global economic and political environments have caused the oilfield services industry to experience volatility in terms of demand. While our management is generally optimistic for the continuing development of the onshore North American oil and gas industry, there are a number of political and economic pressures negatively impacting the economics of continuing production from some existing wells, future drilling operations, and the willingness of banks and investors to provide capital to participants in the oil and gas industry. These cuts in spending will continue to curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, and will continue to result in a reduction in the demand for the Company\u2019s services, the rates we can charge, and equipment utilization. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s customers could become unable to pay their suppliers, including the Company. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success depends on key members of our management, the loss of any executive or key personnel could disrupt our business operations.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain of our executive officers. The loss of the services of Rick Kasch, Austin Peitz, Robert Devers or other key personnel, could disrupt our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Kasch, Peitz and Devers, that contain, among other things non-compete and confidentiality provisions, we may not be able to enforce the non-compete and/or confidentiality provisions in the employment agreements.\nWe depend on several significant customers, and a loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s customers consist primarily of major and independent oil and natural gas companies. During fiscal year 2016, three of the Company\u2019s customers accounted for 37% of consolidated revenues and during fiscal year 2015, two of the Company\u2019s customers accounted for 21% of consolidated revenues. No other customer exceeded 10% of revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s top five customers accounted for approximately 52% and 38% of its total annual revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss of any one of these customers or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWhile the Company believes our equipment could be redeployed in the current market environment if we lost any material customers, such loss could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business until the equipment is redeployed. We believe that the market for the Company\u2019s services is sufficiently diversified that it is not dependent on any single customer or a few major customers.\nDemand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the domestic oil and natural gas industry. The Company has no influence over its customers\u2019 capital expenditures. On-going economic volatility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBeginning in the second half of 2014, oil prices have declined substantially from historical highs. This caused many of our customers to reduce or delay their oil and natural gas exploration and production spending in 2015, which consequently has reduced their demand for our services, and exerted downward pressure on the prices that we charged for our services and products. Given various domestic and global factors, oil and natural gas prices may remain depressed for the foreseeable future.\nAlso, under an environment of increasing oil and natural gas prices it can lead to increasing costs of exploring for and producing oil and natural gas. Though the addition of frac stimulation into the domestic oil and gas industry has somewhat reduced the overall costs of producing oil and natural gas, the price of drill rigs, pipe, other equipment, fluids, and oil field services and the cost to companies like the Company of providing those services, has generally increased with significant increases in oil and natural gas prices. The resulting reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers during the past months due to the decline in oil prices and the increase of the costs of exploring for and producing oil and natural gas as noted above could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.\nWe are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the importation and use of hazardous materials, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. Government authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, injunctions or both. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.\nThe Company uses hazardous substances and transports hazardous wastes in its operations. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require the Company to incur costs and penalties, or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce its earnings and cash available for operations. The Company believes it is currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nIntense competition within the well services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nThe well services industry is intensely competitive. It includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. The Company\u2019s larger competitors have greater resources that allow those competitors to compete more effectively than the Company. The Company\u2019s small competitors may be able to react to market conditions more quickly. The amount of equipment available may exceed demand at some point in time, which could result in active price competition.\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.\nAs is the situation with all companies in the frac water heating service business, we rely on certain procedures and practices in performing our services. In 2016, we were issued our first patent relating to an aspect of the frac water heating process. We have other patent applications pending regarding other procedures used in our process of heating frac water. We are aware that one unrelated company (the \u201cPatent Owner\u201d) has been awarded four patents related, in part, to a process for heating of frac water. The Patent Owner is currently in litigation with two different groups of energy companies that are seeking to invalidate the first patent. A North Dakota court has issued a summary judgment that the first patent owned by the Patent Owner is invalid. The same Court also found that this first patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by the Patent Owner and/or the inventor. The Patent Owner has filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to appeal this judgment and other adverse judgments and orders by the North Dakota court. As of March 30, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has not issued a ruling on this case.\nIn October 2014, the Company was served with a complaint that alleges that Enservco and Heat Waves, in offering and selling frac water heating services, infringed and induced others to infringe two patents owned by the Patent Owner including the first patent ruled invalid and unenforceable by the North Dakota Court. The complaint seeks various remedies including injunctive relief and unspecified damages and relates to only a portion of Heat Waves\u2019 frac water heating services. Heat Waves has answered the complaint, denied the Patent Owner\u2019s allegations of infringement and asserted counterclaims asking the Court to find, among other things, that it does not infringe either patent and that both patents are invalid. The Patent Owner has replied to and denied those counterclaims. In July 2015, a Colorado Court granted a joint request by Enservco, Heat Waves and the Patent Owner to stay the case. The lawsuit is now stayed pending the outcome of the appeal by the Patent Owner of the summary judgment invalidating the Patent Owner\u2019s first patent as set forth above. (See Item 3 - Litigation, for more information about this matter.)\nHowever, if Enservco and/or Heat Waves are found to be infringing, they could be liable for the payment of substantial damages/royalties and attorneys\u2019 fees, and/or be subject to a preliminary or permanent injunction prohibiting Heat Waves from heating frac water in a manner it may have been using.\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies, but to the extent not covered, are self-insured by the Company.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and oil spills. These conditions can cause:\n\u25a0\nPersonal injury or loss of life,\n\u25a0\nDamage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment, and\n\u25a0\nSuspension of operations by our customers.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nThe Company maintains insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these hazards. In addition, in June 2015, the Company became self-insured under its Employee Group Medical Plan for the first $75,000 per individual participant. However, we do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against, or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at reasonable rates. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive. It is likely that, in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or considerably more expensive than it has been in the recent past. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits, and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination.\nWhile our growth strategy includes appropriate acquisitions, we may not be successful in identifying, making and integrating business or asset acquisitions, if any, in the future.\nWe anticipate that a component of our growth strategy may be to make geographically focused acquisitions of businesses or assets aimed to strengthen our presence and expand services offered in selected regional markets. Pursuit of this strategy may be restricted by the on-going volatility and uncertainty within the credit markets which may significantly limit the availability of funds for such acquisitions. Our ability to use shares of our common stock in an acquisition transaction may be adversely affected by the volatility in the price of our stock.\nIn addition to restricted funding availability, the success of this strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to negotiate acceptable financial and other terms. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so. The success of an acquisition also depends on our ability to perform adequate due diligence before the acquisition and on our ability to integrate the acquisition after it is completed. While the Company intends to commit significant resources to ensure that it conducts comprehensive due diligence, there can be no assurance that all potential risks and liabilities will be identified in connection with an acquisition. Similarly, while we expect to commit substantial resources, including management time and effort, to integrating acquired businesses into ours, there is no assurance that we will be successful in integrating these businesses. In particular, it is important that the Company be able to retain both key personnel of the acquired business and its customer base. A loss of either key personnel or customers could negatively impact the future operating results of any acquired business.\nIn January 2016, HWWM, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired various assets including the water transfer assets of HIIT and WET for approximately $4.3 million dollars. The Company\u2019s ability to successfully integrate these acquisitions and expand the water transfer and bacteria and scaling solutions services is a going to be challenging given the current industry environment. There can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate these acquisitions and expand these services.\nCompliance with climate change legislation or initiatives could negatively impact our business.\nThe U.S. Congress has considered legislation to mandate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and certain states have already implemented, or may be in the process of implementing, similar legislation. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has held in its decisions that carbon dioxide can be regulated as an \u201cair pollutant\u201d under the Clean Air Act, which could result in future regulations even if the U.S. Congress does not adopt new legislation regarding emissions. At this time, it is not possible to predict how legislation or new federal or state government mandates regarding the emission of greenhouse gases could impact our business; however, any such future laws or regulations could require us or our customers to devote potentially material amounts of capital or other resources in order to comply with such regulations. These expenditures could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAnti-fracking initiatives could adversely impact our business.\nSome states and certain municipalities have regulated, or are considering regulating hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) which, if accomplished, could impact certain of our operations. While the Company does not believe that these regulations and contemplated actions to limit or prohibit fracking have impacted its activities to date, there can be no assurance that these actions, if taken on a wider scale, may not adversely impact the Company\u2019s business operations and revenues.\nDebt Related Risks\nOur indebtedness, which is currently collateralized by substantially all of our assets, could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company owed approximately $23.8 million to banks and financial institutions under various collateralized debt.\nOur current and future indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25a0\nImpair our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes,\n\u25a0\nLimit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness,\n\u25a0\nMake us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general as a substantial portion of our operating cash flow will be required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in industry and market conditions,\n\u25a0\nPut us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt, or\n\u25a0\nIncrease our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent that we incur additional variable rate indebtedness, a variable rate that has increased as a result of the Sixth Amendment to our lending agreement with PNC Bank.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various debt service covenants and/or reporting covenants in the business loan agreements or other instruments governing our current or any future indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of our credit facilities or such other instruments.\nThe availability of borrowings under our credit facility is based on a borrowing base which is subject to redetermination by our lender based on a number of factors and the lender\u2019s internal credit criteria. In the event the amount outstanding under our credit facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at such time, we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings on an accelerated basis.\nIn the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments there under and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any of the foregoing consequences could restrict our ability to grow our business and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nWe may be unable to meet the obligations of various financial covenants that are contained in the terms of our loan agreements with our principal lender, PNC Bank, National Association.\nThe Company\u2019s agreements with PNC impose various obligations and financial covenants on the Company. The outstanding amount under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, entered into with PNC in September 2014 and amended various times, is due in full on April 30, 2018. The revolving credit agreement with PNC has a variable interest rate and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nFurther, the related agreements with PNC impose various financial covenants on the Company including maintaining a prescribed fixed charge coverage ratio, maximum leverage ratio, and limit the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional debt or operating lease obligations. The depressed conditions in the oil and natural gas industry and the resultant reduction in drilling activity in our service areas has made it more difficult to meet our financial covenants.\nOn March 31, 2017, we entered into the tenth amendment to our 2014 Credit Agreement with PNC. In connection with such amendment, PNC has required us to (among other things) raise $1 million of subordinated debt by May 15, 2017. In addition, the amendment accelerated the maturity date of the loan from September 12, 2019 to April 30, 2018. Thus, beginning in May 2017, the outstanding loan with PNC will be classified as a current liability. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Although the Company has obtained waivers of financial covenants or modifications to our credit agreements in the past when we have failed to meet specific provisions (including for various periods in the 2016 fiscal year), there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these waivers or modifications in the future. If the Company is unable to comply with its obligations and covenants under the 2014 Credit Agreement and it declares an event of default, all of its obligations to PNC could become immediately due. In addition, considering our limited financial resources and reduced operating results due to the depressed oil and gas markets, we cannot assure investors that the Company will be successful in extending or replacing the 2014 Credit Agreement on its new maturity date. Failure to extend, replace or repay the loan in full at maturity will likely force us to consider a sale of the Company.\nThe variable rate indebtedness with PNC subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nThe Company\u2019s borrowings through PNC bear interest at variable rates, exposing the Company to interest rate risk. In September 2015, the Company entered into an Interest Rate Swap Agreement with a notional balance of $10 million in conjunction with the senior revolving credit facility with PNC bank. The Company has decided not to hedge against the interest rate risk associated with the remaining balance of the senior revolving credit facility (with a maximum available balance of $30 million). We may increase, decrease or terminate some or all of these hedging arrangements in the future. Depending on our overall hedging level, our debt service obligations could increase significantly in the event of large increases in interest rates. The Sixth Amendment to our 2014 Credit Agreement with PNC resulted in (among other things) an increase in our variable interest rate by 1.75% for the balance of the term of the agreement.\nOur debt obligations, which may increase in the future, may reduce our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had borrowed approximately $23.2 million under our senior revolving credit facility and had approximately $4.5 million of borrowing capacity available under this facility. Although the Company plans to utilize cash flow from operations during the first half of 2017 to reduce our outstanding borrowings, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If the Company is unable to reduce debt as planned or new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.\nA high level of indebtedness subjects us to a number of adverse risks. In particular, a high level of indebtedness may make it more likely that a reduction in the borrowing base of our credit facility following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings, may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, and increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. In addition, we may be required to devote a significant portion of our cash flows to servicing our debt, and we are subject to interest rate risk under our credit facility, which bears interest at a variable rate and increased by 1.75% as a result of the Sixth Amendment. Any further increase in our interest rates (whether by amendment to our 2014 Credit Agreement or as the result of economic conditions) could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt when due, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders, refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional shares of securities. We may not be able to complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Stockholders may not receive funds without selling their shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and investment opportunities. In addition, we have agreed with PNC, our principal lender that we will not pay any cash dividends on our common stock until our obligations to PNC are paid in full. Accordingly, realization of a gain on a shareholder\u2019s investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors can, without stockholder approval, cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which none are issued and outstanding as of the date of this annual report. Also, our board of directors, without stockholder approval, may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares. If our board of directors causes shares of preferred stock to be issued, the rights of the holders of our common stock would likely be subordinate to those of preferred holders and therefore could be adversely affected. Our board of directors\u2019 ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and to cause its issuance, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Preferred shares issued by our board of directors could include voting rights or super voting rights, which could shift the ability to control the Company to the holders of the preferred stock. Preferred stock could also have conversion rights into shares of our common stock at a discount to the market price of our common stock, which could negatively affect the market for our common stock. In addition, preferred stock would have preference in the event of liquidation of the corporation, which means that the holders of preferred stock would be entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation distributed in liquidation before the holders of our common stock receive any distribution of the liquidated assets. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you paid. Our stock price volatility can be in response to a number of factors, including those listed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report. Many of these volatility factors are beyond our control. Other factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf\nliquidity;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nchanges in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our cash flow from operations or earnings estimates;\n\u25cf\npublication of research reports about us or the oil and natural gas exploration, production and service industry generally;\n\u25cf\ncompetition from other oil and gas service companies and for, among other things, capital and skilled personnel;\n\u25cf\nincreases in market interest rates which may increase our cost of capital;\n\u25cf\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings, and enforcement and legal actions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u25cf\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u25cf\ncommencement of or involvement in litigation;\n\u25cf\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes, and other related issues in our industry;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community regarding our business;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market and economic conditions; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the U.S. securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Market fluctuations and broad market, economic and industry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Any volatility or a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock could also negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions using our common stock. Further, if we were to be the object of securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in our common stock price or for other reasons, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our financial results.\nOur existing shareholders could experience further dilution if we elect to raise equity capital to meet our liquidity needs or finance a strategic transaction.\nAs part of our strategy we may desire to raise capital and or utilize our common stock to effect strategic business transactions. Either such action will likely require that we issue equity (or debt) securities which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we will attempt to minimize the dilutive impact of any future capital-raising activities or business transactions, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to do so. If we are successful in raising additional working capital, we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock at prices at a discount from the then-current market price of our common stock.\nThe value of our common stock may decline significantly if we are unable to maintain our NYSE MKT listing.\nOur common stock has recently sold and may continue to sell at a price per share well below $1.00. The NYSE MKT rules contain requirements with respect to continued listing standards, which include, among other things, when it appears to the Board of Directors of the Exchange that \u201cthe extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable\u201d (Rule 1002). Rule 1003 also provides that the Exchange will not normally consider removing shares from listing where, like Enservco at the present time, \u201cthe issuer has at least 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15,000,000 and 400 round lot shareholders\u201d.\nWe believe we are in compliance with NYSE MKT listing requirements, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those listing requirements in the future. If we fail to meet the requirements, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, we would be forced to list our common stock on the OTC Markets or some other quotation medium, depending on our ability to meet the specific requirements of those quotation systems. In that case, we may lose some or all of our institutional investors, and selling our common stock on the OTC Markets would be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold and transactions could be delayed. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common stock. Further, because of the additional regulatory burdens imposed upon broker-dealers with respect to de-listed companies, delisting could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our stock, further limiting the liquidity of our shares. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, liquidity, value and marketability of our stock.\nGeneral Corporate Risks\nConcentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any stockholder will be able to influence the election of directors or engage in a change of control transaction.\nSeven stockholders directly and indirectly own approximately 53.8% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and have the ability to heavily influence the election of our directors when they again stand for reelection. Furthermore, it is likely that no person seeking control of the Company through stock ownership will be able to succeed in doing so without negotiating an arrangement to do so with these stockholders. For so long as these stockholders continue to own a significant percentage of the outstanding shares of the Company common stock, they will retain such influence over the election of the board of directors and the negotiation of any change of control transaction.\nProvisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay a change in control or a takeover.\nProvisions in our bylaws provide certain requirements for the nomination of directors which preclude a stockholder from nominating a candidate to stand for election at any annual meeting. As described in Section 2.12 of the Company\u2019s bylaws, nominations must be presented to the Company well in advance of a scheduled annual meeting, and the notification must include specific information as set forth in that section. The Company believes that such a provision provides reasonable notice of the nominees to the board of directors, but it may preclude stockholder nomination at a meeting where the stockholder is not familiar with nomination procedures and, therefore, may prevent or delay a change of control or takeover.\nAlthough the Delaware General Corporation Law includes \u00a7112 which provides that bylaws of Delaware corporations may require the corporation to include in its proxy materials one or more nominees submitted by stockholders in addition to individuals nominated by the board of directors, the bylaws of the Company do not so provide. As a result, if any stockholder desires to nominate persons for election to the board of directors, the proponent will have to incur all of the costs normally associated with a proxy contest.\nIndemnification of officers and directors may result in unanticipated expenses.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, and indemnification agreements between the Company and certain individuals provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with us or activities on our behalf. We also will bear the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents, upon such person\u2019s promise to repay them if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures by us that we may be unable to recoup and could direct funds away from our business and products (if any).\nWe have significant obligations under the 1934 Act and the NYSE MKT.\nBecause we are a public company filing reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and extensive and complex regulation. The Securities and Exchange Commission has the right to review the accuracy and completeness of our reports, press releases, and other public documents. In addition, we are subject to extensive requirements to institute and maintain financial accounting controls and for the accuracy and completeness of our books and records. In addition to regulation by the SEC, we are subject to the NYSE MKT rules. The NYSE MKT rules contain requirements with respect to corporate governance, communications with shareholders, and various other matters.\nForward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate.\nIn our effort to make the information in this report more meaningful, this report contains both historical and forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meanings of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the 1934 Act. Forward-looking statements in this report are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the current expectations of our management concerning future results and events. We have attempted to qualify our forward-looking statements with appropriate cautionary language to take advantage of the judicially-created doctrine of \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d and other protections.\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance and achievements to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements in this annual report. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results.", "PERMNO": 15254, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "ENSV"}
