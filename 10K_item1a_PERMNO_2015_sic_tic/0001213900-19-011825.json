{"cik": "1413263", "company": "CHINA JO-JO DRUGSTORES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-07-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated into this report that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nFuture acquisitions are expected to be a part of our growth strategy, and could expose us to significant business risks.\nWe have grown our business, in part, through the acquisition of stores over the years. One of our strategies going forward is to continue our growth by acquiring additional drugstores. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify and secure suitable acquisition opportunities. Our ability to consummate and integrate effectively any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources and, to the extent necessary, our ability to obtain any necessary financing for larger acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us. Moreover, if an acquisition target is identified, the third parties with whom we seek to cooperate may not select us as a potential partner or we may not be able to enter into arrangements on commercially reasonable terms. The negotiation and completion of potential acquisitions, whether or not ultimately consummated, could also significantly divert management\u2019s time and resources and may potentially disrupt our existing business. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that the expected synergies from future acquisitions will actually materialize. Additionally, future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, costs, and contingent liabilities, causing us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or incur write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with:\n\u25cf the integration of new operations, services and personnel;\n\u25cf unforeseen or hidden liabilities;\n\u25cf the diversion of financial or other resources from our existing businesses;\n\u25cf difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u25cf our inability to generate sufficient revenue to recover costs and expenses of the acquisitions; and\n\u25cf potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees or customers.\nAny of the above could significantly disrupt our ability to manage our business and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition, and if we do not compete successfully against existing and new competitors, our revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nBoth the drugstore, online pharmacy and wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industries in China are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Our primary drugstore competitors include other drugstore chains and independent drugstores. Increasingly, we also face competition from discount stores, convenience stores and supermarkets as we expand our offering of non-drug convenience products and services. We compete for customers and revenue primarily on the basis of store location, merchandise selection, price, services offered, and our brand name. Our online pharmacy competitors include other online pharmaceutical vendors. As more large traditional drugstore chain companies entered into the online sales, we face competition ranging from prices to service. Our primary wholesale competitors include regional and national players. In addition, we may be subject to additional competition from new entrants to both industries in China. We could also face increased competition from foreign companies if the Chinese government removes the restrictions on the entry of foreign companies into these industries.\nSome of our larger competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as:\n\u25cf greater financial and other resources;\n\u25cf larger variety of products;\n\u25cf more extensive and advanced supply chain management systems;\n\u25cf greater pricing flexibility;\n\u25cf larger economies of scale and purchasing power;\n\u25cf more extensive advertising and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf greater knowledge of local market conditions;\n\u25cf stronger brand recognition; and\n\u25cf larger sales and distribution networks.\nAs a result of the aforementioned advantages, we may be unable to offer products similar to, or more desirable than, those offered by our competitors, market our products as effectively as our competitors, or otherwise respond successfully to competitive pressures. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. Our competitors may be able to offer larger discounts on competing products, and we may not be able to profitably match those discounts. Furthermore, our competitors may offer products that are more attractive to our customers or that render our products uncompetitive. In addition, the timing of the introduction of competing products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products. Our failure to successfully compete could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, and prospects.\nChanges in economic conditions and consumer confidence in China may influence the drugstore industry, consumer preferences and spending patterns.\nOur business and revenue growth primarily depend on the size of the pharmaceutical market in China. As a result, our revenue and profitability may be negatively affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence in China. In particular, as we focus on our expansion of pharmacies in metropolitan markets, where living standards and consumer purchasing power are relatively high, we are especially susceptible to changes in economic conditions, consumer confidence and customer preferences of the urban Chinese population. External factors beyond our control that affect consumer confidence include unemployment rates, levels of personal disposable income, national, regional or local economic conditions, and acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns. A decrease in overall consumer spending as a result of changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our front-end and pharmacy sales and negatively impact our profitability. In addition, acts of war or terrorism may cause damage to our facilities, disrupt the supply of the products and services we offer in our stores, or adversely impact consumer demand. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to timely identify or otherwise effectively respond to changing customer preferences, and we may fail to optimize our product offering and inventory position.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in China is rapidly evolving and is subject to rapidly changing customer preferences that are difficult to predict. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and identify customer preferences, and adapt our product selection to meet these preferences. In particular, we must optimize our product selection and inventory positions based on sales trends. We cannot provide assurance that our product selection, especially our selection of nutritional supplements and food products, will accurately reflect customer preferences at any given time. If we fail to accurately anticipate either the market for our products or customers\u2019 purchasing habits or fail to respond to customers\u2019 changing preferences promptly and effectively, we may not be able to adapt our product selection to customer preferences or make appropriate adjustments to our inventory positions, which could significantly reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs.\nOur success depends on our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, including pricing strategies implemented in response to competitive pressures and/or to drive demand for our products. Our advertisements are designed to promote our brand, our corporate image and the prices of products available for sale in our stores. Our pricing strategies and value propositions must be appropriate for our target customers. If we are not able to maintain and increase the awareness of our pharmacy\u2019s brand and the products and services we provide, we may not be able to attract and retain customers and our reputation may also suffer. We expect to incur substantial expenses in our marketing and promotional efforts to both attract and retain customers. However, our marketing and promotional activities may be less successful than we anticipate, and may not be effective at building our brand awareness and customer base. In addition, the government may impose restrictions on how marketing and promotional activities can be conducted. We cannot provide assurance that our current and proposed budget for marketing activities will be adequate to support our future growth. Failure to successfully execute our advertising, marketing and promotional programs may result in material decreases in our revenue and profitability.\nOur ability to grow our business may be constrained by our inability to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the expiration of our current leases.\nOur ability to grow our business may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use regulations and other regulations applicable to the kinds of stores we seek to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. Furthermore, changing local demographics at existing store locations could materially and adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores, and overall our business, financial condition, results of operation, and prospects.\nWe have significant cash deposits with our suppliers and landlords in order to obtain and maintain our inventory and maintain and establish store locations, which we may not be able to recover in the event of bankruptcy by our suppliers or landlords or other events beyond our control.\nOur ability to obtain products and maintain inventory at, and to establish and maintain leases for, our pharmacies, is dependent upon our ability to post and maintain significant cash deposits with our suppliers and landlords. Many vendors in China are unwilling to ship merchandise on credit and instead require cash deposits, and landlords may require security deposits consisting of the equivalent of twelve (12) months of rent . As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.5 million deposited with suppliers and approximately $3.4 million deposited with landlords for our pharmacies. If we are unable or unwilling to establish such advances and deposits, our ability to generate sales and expand our business could be adversely affected. In general, we expect the amounts required for advances and deposits to increase as we undertake our expansion plans, complete store openings and expand our business through acquisitions or otherwise. We do not generally receive interest on the deposits made to suppliers or landlords, and such deposits are subject to the risk of loss as a result of the creditworthiness or bankruptcy of the party who holds our funds, as well as the risk from any illegal acts associated with the third party, such as conversion, fraud, theft or dishonesty. If these circumstances were to arise, we could find it difficult or impossible, due to the unpredictability of legal proceedings in China, to recover all or a portion of the amount on deposit with our vendors or landlords.\nIf we are unable to optimize management of our procurement and distribution activities, we may be unable to meet customer demand while increasing the burden on managing our supply chain.\nSince May 2011, we have been using Jiuxin Medicine\u2019s facility as our distribution center for both our retail and wholesale businesses. Starting from March 31, 2018, we outsourced our logistic service to Astro Boy Cloud Pan (Hangzhou) Storage and Logistic Co. Ltd (\u201cAstro Boy Logistic\u201d). As a result, Jiuxin Medicine\u2019s warehouse lease has been terminated. Astro Boy Logistic provides us with a facility with approximately 14,000 square meters located approximately eighteen (18) miles from our headquarters, which served as our central distribution center. Astro Boy Logistic\u2019s staff and vehicles make regular deliveries to our pharmacies and wholesale customers. Our ability to meet customer demand may be significantly limited if we do not successfully and efficiently conduct our distribution activities, or if Astro Boy Logistic\u2019s facility is destroyed or shut down for any reason, including as the result of natural disasters. Any disruption in the operation of our distribution activities could result in higher costs or longer lead times associated with distributing our products. Since it is difficult to predict accurate sales volume in our industry, we may be unable to optimize our distribution activities, which may result in excess or insufficient inventory, warehousing, fulfillment or distribution capacity. Furthermore, failure to effectively control product damage during the distribution process could decrease our operating margins and reduce our profitability.\nAll product procurement is handled through our corporate headquarters. Such centralization is intended to reduce the cost of goods sold as a result of volume purchase benefits. However, we may be less successful than anticipated in achieving these volume purchase benefits. In addition, such centralization is expected to increase the complexity of tracking inventory and could place additional burdens on the management of our supply chain. If we cannot successfully reduce our costs through centralizing procurement, our profitability and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain optimal inventory levels could increase our inventory holding costs or cause us to lose sales, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe need to maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate both of our retail and wholesale businesses successfully as well as meet customer expectations. However, we must also guard against the risk of accumulating excess inventory. We are exposed to inventory risks as a result of rapid changes in product life cycles, changing consumer preferences, uncertainty of the success of product launches, seasonality, and manufacturer backorders and other vendor-related problems. We cannot provide assurance that we can accurately predict these trends and events and avoid over-stocking or under-stocking products. In addition, demand for products could change significantly between the time product inventory is ordered and the time it is available for sale.\nWhen we begin selling a new product, it is particularly difficult to accurately forecast product demand. The purchase of certain types of inventory may require significant lead-time. As we carry a broad selection of products and maintain significant inventory levels for a substantial portion of our merchandise, we may be unable to sell such inventory in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. Carrying excess inventory could increase our inventory holding costs, and failure to have inventory in stock when a customer orders or purchases it could cause us to lose that order or that customer, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on computer software and hardware systems in managing our operations, the capacity of which may restrict our growth and the failure of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our integrated information management system to monitor daily operations of our retail and wholesale businesses, and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. In addition, we rely on our computer hardware and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of the data of our retail and wholesale systems. If our computer software and hardware systems fail to meet the increasing needs of our expanding operations, our ability to grow may be constrained. Furthermore, any system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or causes lags in service time could disrupt our normal operations. Although we believe that our computer software and hardware systems are up to date and that our disaster recovery plan is adequate in handling potential failures, we cannot provide assurance that we can effectively carry out this disaster recovery plan and that we will be able to restore our operation within a sufficiently short time frame to avoid our business being disrupted. Furthermore, our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our computer software and/or hardware systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions. Due to the limited coverage of business interruption insurance policies offered in China, we do not carry business interruption insurance and, as a result, any business disruption or natural disaster could severely disrupt our business and operations and, in turn, significantly decrease our revenue and profitability.\nWe depend substantially on the continuing efforts of the Key Personnel, and our business and prospects may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur future success is dependent on the continued services of the Key Personnel but we do not maintain key-man insurance. If we lose the services of any one of the Key Personnel, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements, which could severely disrupt our business and prospects. Each of the Key Personnel has entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with us. However, if any disputes arise between us and the Key Personnel, we cannot provide assurance, in light of uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, that any of these agreements can be enforced in China, the jurisdiction in which the Key Personnel reside and hold some of their assets. See \u201d Risks Related to Doing Business in China - You may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based on United States or other foreign laws against us or our management. \u201c\nWe depend on the continued service of, and on the ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified and skilled personnel for our business.\nThe implementation of our business strategy and our future success also depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to attract, hire and retain sufficient numbers of skilled personnel necessary to continue to develop and grow our business. We face competition for personnel from both retail and wholesale pharmaceutical distribution operators. This competition could require us to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. On the other hand, we may be unable to attract or retain the personnel required to achieve our business objectives, and that failure could severely disrupt our business and prospects. The process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy. If our recruitment and retention efforts are unsuccessful in the future, it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nOur retail and wholesale operations require a number of permits and licenses in order to carry on their business.\nWe are required to obtain certain permits and licenses from various PRC governmental authorities, including a Drug Distribution Permit and a GSP certification. We are also required to obtain food hygiene certificates for the distribution of nutritional supplements and food products. We cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain all required licenses, permits and certifications to carry on our business at all times, and from time to time we may have not been in the past, or may not be in the future, in compliance with all such required licenses, permits and certifications. Moreover, these licenses, permits and certifications are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the relevant PRC governmental authorities and the standards of such renewal or reassessment may change from time to time. We intend to apply for renewal of these licenses, permits and certifications when required by applicable laws and regulations. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain all licenses, permits and certifications necessary to carry on our business at any time could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any inability to renew any of these licenses, permits and certifications could severely disrupt our business, and prevent us from continuing to carry on our business. Any changes in the standards used by governmental authorities in considering whether to renew or reassess our business licenses, permits and certifications, as well as any enactment of new regulations that may restrict the conduct of our business, may also decrease our revenue and/or increase our costs, materially reducing our profitability and prospects. Furthermore, if the interpretation or implementation of existing laws and regulations changes or if new regulations come into effect requiring us to obtain any additional licenses, permits or certifications that were previously not required to operate our existing businesses, we cannot provide assurance that we can successfully obtain such licenses, permits or certifications.\nWe may need additional capital, and the sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders, while debts may require us to make covenants restricting how we operate.\nWe believe that the aggregate amount of our current cash, anticipated cash flow from operations, available borrowings under our existing bank facilities, and personal loans from our principal shareholders should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the near future. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of our existing stockholders. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain any requisite financing, the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations, and could result in further operating and financing covenants that would restrict our freedom to operate our business, such as conditions that:\n\u25cf limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consent for the payment of dividends;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nRisks Relating to Our Pharmacy Operations\nOur brand names, trade secrets and other intellectual property are valuable assets. If we are unable to protect them from infringement, our business and prospects may be harmed.\nWe consider our pharmacy brand names to be valuable assets. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using such brand names without authorization, which may adversely affect our business and reputation, including the perceived quality and reliability of our products and services. We have five (5) registered trademarks. We also own three (3) domain names that we actively use in our business.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our know-how and other proprietary information, including pricing, purchasing, promotional strategies, customer lists and/or suppliers lists. As a result, our employees are required to sign employment agreements that contain confidentiality provisions as a condition of their employment with us. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we believe we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors or advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition, confidentiality agreements executed by the aforementioned individuals may not be enforceable or provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.\nIf we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, such efforts could be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome unpredictable. Additionally, if our competitors independently develop information that is equivalent to our trade secrets or other proprietary information, we have little recourse to enforce our rights, and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. However, since the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in the PRC are uncertain and still evolving, we may not be successful in prosecuting these cases. In addition, any litigation, proceeding or other efforts to protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and could seriously harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect our trade names, trade secrets and other propriety information from infringement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to intellectual property infringement and other claims by third parties which, if successful, could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to use our proprietary information and know-how without infringing third party intellectual property rights. As litigation becomes more common in China, we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims for intellectual property infringement, invalidity or indemnification relating to other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Our current or potential competitors, many of whom have substantial resources, may have or may obtain intellectual property protection that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to conduct our business in China. Moreover, the defense of intellectual property suits, including trademark infringement suits and related legal and administrative proceedings, can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceeding to which we may become a party could cause us to:\n\u25cf pay damage awards;\n\u25cf seek licenses from third parties;\n\u25cf pay ongoing royalties;\n\u25cf redesign our product offerings; or\n\u25cf be restricted by injunctions,\nEach of which could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business and result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase from our stores, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued penetration of counterfeit products into the pharmaceutical market in China may damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCounterfeit products have continued to make their way into the Chinese pharmaceutical market. Counterfeit products are generally sold at lower prices compared to their authentic counterparts due to their low production costs, and in some cases may be very similar in appearance to their authentic counterparts. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals may or may not have the same chemical content as their authentic counterparts, and are typically manufactured without proper licenses or approvals as well as fraudulently mislabeled with respect to their content and/or manufacturer. Although China\u2019s central government has been increasingly active in combating counterfeit pharmaceutical and other products, China does not yet have effective regulatory control or an enforcement system over counterfeit pharmaceutical products. Although we have implemented a series of quality control procedures in our procurement process, we cannot provide assurance that we may not be inadvertently selling counterfeit pharmaceutical products. Any unintentional sale of counterfeit products may subject us to negative publicity, fines and/or other administrative penalties, or may even result in litigation against us. Moreover, the increased distribution of counterfeit products and other products in recent years may reinforce the negative image of drug distributors among consumers in China. The continued proliferation of counterfeit products in China could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition, and results of operation.\nAs a distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products, we are exposed to inherent risks relating to product liability and personal injury claims.\nDistributors of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of such products. Such risks include unintentional distribution of counterfeit, mislabeled or contaminated drugs, and, with respect to our pharmacies, improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings. Errors in the packaging or dispensing of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Furthermore, the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations require our in-store pharmacists to offer counseling to our customers, without additional charge, about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects, and other information the in-store pharmacists deem significant. Our in-store pharmacists sometimes also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects, and we may be liable for claims arising from any advice given by our in-store pharmacists. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide, and we may be required to pay for substantial monetary damages for any successful product liability or personal injury claim against us. We may, however, in product liability claims, have the right under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations to recover from the relevant manufacturer any compensation we paid to our customers in connection with such claim. Even if we successfully defend ourselves against this type of claim, we could be required to spend significant management, financial and other resources in the process, which could disrupt our business. Our reputation and our brand names may also suffer as a result of any product liability or personal injury claims against us. Like many other similar companies in China, we do not carry product liability insurance. A product recall or damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury claim or judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with the applicable PRC laws and regulations governing sales of medicines under China\u2019s National Medical Insurance Program.\nEligible participants in China\u2019s national medical insurance program, mainly consisting of urban residents in China, are entitled to buy medicines using their medical insurance cards from an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicines they purchase have been included in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs. The pharmacy, in turn, obtains reimbursement from the relevant government social security bureaus. Moreover, the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations prohibit pharmacies from selling goods other than pre-approved medicines when purchases are made with medical insurance cards. We have established procedures to prohibit our drugstores from selling unauthorized goods to customers who make purchases with medical insurance cards. However, we cannot provide assurance that those procedures will be strictly followed by all of our employees in all of our stores.\nRisks Relating to Our Medical Services\nIf we do not attract and retain qualified physicians and other medical personnel, our ability to provide medical services would be adversely affected.\nThe success of our medical services will, in part, be dependent upon the number and quality of doctors, nurses and other medical support personnel that we employ and our ability to maintain good relationships with them. Our medical staff may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to successfully maintain good relationships with them, our ability to provide medical services may be adversely affected.\nThe provision of medical services is heavily regulated in the PRC and failure to comply with those regulations could result in penalties, loss of licensure, additional compliance costs or other adverse consequences.\nHealthcare providers in China, as in most other populous countries, are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the national and local government levels. These laws and regulations relate to: licensing; the conduct of operations; the ownership of facilities; the addition of facilities and services; advertising; confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records; billing for services; and prices for services. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate. In addition, further healthcare legislative reform is likely, and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in the event that we do not comply or if the cost of compliance is prohibitive. The above list of certain regulated areas is not exhaustive, and it is not possible to anticipate the exact nature of future healthcare legislative reform in China. Depending on the priorities set by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the political climate at any given time, the continued development of the Chinese healthcare system and many other factors, future legislative reforms may be highly comprehensive, including stringent infection control policies, improved rural healthcare facilities, increased regulation of the distribution of pharmaceuticals, and numerous other policy matters. Consequently, the implications of these future reforms could result in penalties, loss of licensure, additional compliance costs or other adverse consequences we cannot foresee at the present time.\nAs a provider of medical services, we are exposed to inherent risks relating to malpractice claims.\nAs a provider of medical services, any misdiagnosis or improper treatment may result in negative publicity regarding us or our services, which would harm our reputation. If we are found liable for malpractice, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Furthermore, even if we successfully defend ourselves against a malpractice claim, we could be required to spend significant management, financial and other resources in the process, which could disrupt our business, and our reputation and brand name may also suffer. Since malpractice claims are not common in China, we do not carry malpractice insurance. As a result, any imposition of malpractice liability could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur clinics compete with a large number and variety of healthcare facilities in their respective markets. There are numerous government-run and private hospitals and clinics available to the general populace. There can be no assurance that these or other clinics, hospitals or other facilities will not commence or expand such operations, which would increase their competitive position. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a healthcare organization that having greater resources in the provision or management of healthcare services will not decide to engage in operations similar to those being conducted by us in Hangzhou.\nRisks Related to Our Herb Farming\nOur herb farming business is subject to the volatility of prices for raw TCM herbs.\nWe currently planted gingko trees in our leased farm land. However, in the future, we may continue to cultivate and sell certain herbs in bulk to third-party vendors, based on local market prices primarily determined by TCM manufacturers and trading companies. Such market prices have increased significantly in recent years in response to changes in the supply of and demand for raw herbs, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including inflation, changes in weather, disease outbreaks, domestic government regulation, market speculation and overall economic conditions. There can be no assurance that market prices, which historically have fluctuated widely, will continue to increase or remain stable, and any future declines in prices may negatively impact the viability of our herb farming business.\nUnforeseen and severe weather can reduce cultivation activities and lead to a decrease in anticipated harvest.\nSeasonal climate change and weather variations such as levels of rainfall and temperature may, among other things, affect the quality, overall supply and availability of raw herbs. Sustained adverse weather conditions in Zhejiang Province in general and in Lin\u2019an in particular where our herbs are planted, such as rain, extreme cold or snow, could disrupt or curtail cultivation activities. This in turn could reduce our anticipated harvest yields, delay the timing of our anticipated harvest and distribution, and negatively affect the quality of our harvest. In addition, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, snowstorms, floods or droughts, or natural conditions such as crop disease, pests or soil erosion, may also negatively impact our cultivation and harvest.\nIn addition, the actual climatic conditions of Zhejiang Province and of Lin\u2019an in particular may not conform to historical patterns and may be affected by variations in weather patterns, including any potential impact of climate change. The effects of climate change may produce more unpredictable weather events that may adversely affect our ability to cultivate and harvest successfully.\nThe occurrence of any of these may materially harm our herb farming business.\nWe have limited control over the availability and the quality of the local farmers with whom we cooperate because we do not employ them directly.\nWe rely on local farmers to farm and harvest our herbs, but do not employ them directly. Instead, they are recruited and employed by the local villagers\u2019 committees with whom we negotiate. We have limited control over the availability and the quality of this labor force. A shortage of suitable laborers may adversely affect our harvest yields.\nRisks Related to Our Online Sales\nWe rely on computer software and hardware systems in managing our online sales, the capacity of which may restrict our growth and the failure of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our electronic commerce system to carry out our online sales. Any system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data, or increases in service time could disrupt our normal operations. Although we believe we have a disaster recovery plan that can handle the failure of our computer software and hardware systems, we cannot provide assurance that we can effectively carry out this disaster recovery plan and that we will be able to restore our operation within a sufficiently short time frame to avoid disruption to our business. Any failure in our computer software and/or hardware systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the capacity of our computer software and hardware systems fails to meet the increasing needs of our operations, our ability to grow may be constrained.\nOur online business decreased in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and we cannot assure our efforts for alternative vendors will result in the increase in revenues from online pharmacy in the coming years.\nOur online pharmacy sales decreased by approximately $3,348,471, or 27.6% for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily caused by the decline in business via e-commerce platforms. In order to increase the popularity of our products, we have made considerable efforts to identify popular products that can drive sales, while keeping a close watch on cost. However, due to the suspension of OTC drug sales on e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 by the China Food and Drug Administration (\u201cCFDA\u201d), our sales via these e-commerce platforms have been curtailed. As a result, our sales via these e-commerce platforms decreased by 33.4% period over period. We are adding more non-medical health products such as nutritional supplements into our sales menu to counteract the decline in sale of OTC drug category. For instance, we are opening a dendrobium candidum flagship store at Tmall with a popular local brand. The brand has a large customer base in Hangzhou. However, there is no assurance our efforts will lead in the increase in our online sales.\nIf our online business fails to obtain and maintain the requisite assets, licenses, qualified personnel and approvals required under the complex regulatory environment for Internet-based businesses in China, the business prospects for such business may be materially and adversely affected.\nInternet-based businesses in China are highly regulated by China\u2019s central government, and numerous regulatory authorities are empowered to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of these businesses. Our online business is operated by our PRC subsidiary, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which is required to obtain and maintain certain assets relevant to its business, such as computers and other electrical equipment, as well as applicable licenses or approvals from different regulatory authorities. These assets and licenses are essential to the operation of an e-commerce business and are generally subject to annual review by the relevant governmental authorities. Furthermore, we may be required to obtain additional licenses. If we fail to obtain or maintain any of the required assets, licenses or approvals, our Internet business may be deemed illegal and it may be subject to various penalties, such as confiscation of illegal income, fines, and/or the discontinuation or restriction of its operations. Any such disruption may materially and adversely affect the prospects of our online business.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nChinese regulations limit foreign ownership of any pharmacy operator with thirty (30) or more stores, and limit foreign ownership of medical clinics to Sino-foreign joint venture. The entities that operate our pharmacies and clinics are controlled by us through contractual arrangements. The validity of such contractual arrangements is uncertain. If the Chinese government determines that these contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the relevant Chinese laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nCurrent PRC regulations limit foreign ownership of a pharmacy operator to forty nine percent (49%) if such operator owns interests in thirty (30) or more drugstores in China that sell a variety of branded pharmaceutical products sourced from different suppliers. Since we do not own any equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy (or its subsidiary Jiuxin Medicine), but instead control it through contractual arrangements, we do not believe that the regulations limiting foreign ownership apply to us even if Jiuzhou Pharmacy or Jiuxin Medicine expands beyond thirty (30) stores. In fact, Jiuzhou Pharmacy has expended to one hundred and twenty-one (121) stores as of March 31, 2019.\nSimilarly, PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of medical practices in China to Sino-foreign joint ventures. Since we do not have any actual equity interest in Jiuzhou Clinic or Jiuzhou Service, but control these entities through contractual arrangements, we do not believe that such PRC regulations are applicable to us or our structure.\nThere are, however, uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the laws, rules and regulations governing the validity and enforcement of our contractual arrangements. Although the structures for operating our business in China (including our corporate structure and contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic, Jiuzhou Service and the Key Personnel) comply with all applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and do not violate, breach, contravene or otherwise conflict with any applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, we cannot provide assurance that a regulatory authority will not determine that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements violate PRC laws, rules or regulations. If any such authority determines that our contractual arrangements are in violation of applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, our contractual arrangements may become invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to consolidate the operations of HJ Group with our results of operations. In addition, new PRC laws, rules and regulations may be introduced from time to time to impose additional requirements that may be applicable to our contractual arrangements. For example, pursuant to the PRC Property Rights Law that became effective on October 1, 2007 (the \u201cProperty Law\u201d), the pledge of any equity interests of a PRC private entity shall become effective once it is duly registered with the local branches of the SAIC. Following the promulgation of the Property Law, the SAIC further issued the Administrative Measures for Registrations of Share Pledge on September 1, 2008, which provided detailed procedural guidance for the local SAIC offices to handle the registrations of pledged shares. The Equity Pledge Agreement that forms a part of the contractual arrangements creates a legally binding obligation on the parties upon the execution date; however, the pledge established under such agreement does not become effective until due registration with the local SAIC office. On May 18, 2010, registration of the pledged equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy was completed.\nThe Chinese government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses, and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by the relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot provide assurance that our current ownership and operating structure will not be found in violation of any current or future Chinese laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease the provision of certain services. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n\u25cf revoking the business and operating licenses of the HJ Group entities;\n\u25cf discontinuing or restricting the operations of the HJ Group entities;\n\u25cf imposing conditions or requirements with which we or the HJ Group entities may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf requiring us or the HJ Group entities to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations; and/or\n\u25cf imposing fines.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by complexity, uncertainties and changes in Chinese regulation of drugstores and the practice of medicine.\nThe Chinese government regulates drugstores and the practice of medicine, including foreign ownership and requirements for licenses and permits. These laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be a violation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe interpretation and application of existing Chinese laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of, pharmaceutical businesses in China, including our business. We currently only have contractual control over the HJ Group entities, and do not own them due to the restrictions on foreign ownership of such companies. However, changes to laws in the PRC may force us to restructure our ownership structure or our operations, which would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUncertainties relating to the regulation of drugstores and medical practice in China also extend to evolving licensing practices, which means that permits, licenses or operations at our company may be subject to challenge. This may disrupt our business or subject us to sanctions, requirements to increase capital, or other conditions or enforcement. In turn, this could compromise enforceability of related contractual arrangements, or have other harmful effects on us.\nOur contractual arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct ownership.\nWe have no equity ownership interest in HJ Group, and rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the HJ Group companies and their businesses. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over these companies as direct ownership. For example, any one of them could fail to take actions required for our business despite its contractual obligation to do so. Under such circumstances, we may have to rely on legal remedies under Chinese law, which may not be effective in providing us any relief. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that the Key Personnel will act in our best interests.\nSince we rely on contractual arrangements to control HJ Group and for substantially all of our revenue, the termination of such agreements will severely and detrimentally affect our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure.\nSince we do not own equity interests of HJ Group, the termination of our contractual arrangements with them would sever our ability to continue receiving payments from them under our current holding company structure. We cannot provide assurance that there will not be any event or reason that may cause the contractual arrangements to terminate. In the event that the contractual arrangements terminate, we will lose our control over them and their business operations and, as a result, over our primary sources of revenue. This may have a severe and detrimental effect on our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure, which in turn may affect the value of your investment. Should this occur, we may seek to acquire control of HJ Group through other means, although we cannot guarantee that we will do so, nor can we guarantee that we will be successful if we do.\nWe rely principally on dividends paid by our consolidated operating entities to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our consolidated PRC entities to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company and rely principally on dividends paid by our consolidated PRC operating entities for cash requirements, including the funds required to service any debt we may incur, which are passed on to us through Jiuxin Management. If any of the consolidated operating entities incurs debt in its own name in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict dividends or other distributions on our equity interest to us. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require us to adjust our taxable income under the contractual arrangements in a manner that would materially and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and other distributions on our equity interest.\nFurthermore, applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations permit payment of dividends by our consolidated PRC entities only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards. Under PRC laws, rules and regulations, our consolidated PRC entities are required to set aside at least ten percent (10%) of their after-tax profit each year, based on PRC accounting standards, into their statutory surplus reserve funds until the accumulative amount of such reserves reaches fifty percent (50%) of their respective registered capital. As a result, our consolidated PRC entities are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net income to us whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances. As of March 31, 2019, our restricted reserves totaled $1,309,109(RMB 9,460,695). Our restricted reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Any limitation on the ability of our consolidated operating entities to pay dividends to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nCertain management members of HJ Group have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may adversely affect our business and your ability for recourse.\nMr. Lei Liu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, is also the executive director of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, a general partner of Jiuzhou Clinic, and the supervising director of Jiuzhou Service. In addition, Mr. Liu has also lent us money out of his personal funds to help facilitate our payments of expenses in the U.S., as well as to purchase a land use right. Ms. Li Qi, our Corporate Secretary and a member of our Board of Directors, is the general manager of each of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, and a general partner of Jiuzhou Clinic. Conflicts of interests between their respective duties to our company and HJ Group may arise. As our directors and executive officers, they have a duty of loyalty and care to us under U.S. and Hong Kong law when there are any potential conflicts of interests between our company and HJ Group. We cannot provide assurance, however, that when any conflicts of interest arise, both of them will act completely in our interests or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in our favor. For example, they may determine that it is in HJ Group\u2019s interests to sever the contractual arrangements with Jiuxin Management, irrespective of the effect such action may have on us. In addition, either one of them could violate his or her legal duties by diverting business opportunities from us to others, thereby affecting the amount of payment that HJ Group is obligated to remit to us under the Consulting Services Agreement.\nIn the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise as a result of any one of the circumstances described above, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against HJ Group, or our officers or directors who are members of the management, all of whom reside within China. Even if you are successful in bringing an action, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of HJ Group and its management, all of which are located in China.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our VIE for our operations, which may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct ownership.\nOur operations and financial results are dependent on our VIEs, Jiuzhou Pharmacy (including its subsidiaries and controlled entities), Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, in which we have no equity ownership interest and must rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the businesses of our VIEs. These contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing control over the VIEs as direct ownership. For example, the VIEs may be unwilling or unable to perform its contractual obligations under our commercial agreements. Consequently, we would not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently planned. In addition, the VIEs may seek to renew its agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of agreements that provide us with substantial ability to control the VIEs, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. In addition, if we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire or enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses may significantly increase.\nIn January 2015, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce released draft legislation that could change how the government regulates corporate structures, especially for VIEs controlled by foreign investments. Instead of looking at \u201cownership\u201d, the draft law focused on the entities or individuals hold control of a VIE. If a VIE is deemed to be controlled by foreign investors, it may be barred from operating in restricted sectors or the prohibited sectors listed on a \u201cnegative list\u201d, where only companies controlled by Chinese nationals could operate, even if structured as VIEs. As of the report date, no formal legislation has been implemented.\nIn the event that the draft law is implemented in any form, and that the Company\u2019s business was characterized as one of the \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d sectors, the VIEs the Company currently maintains contractual arrangements with may be barred from operation which will materially adversely affect our business.\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nPolicies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in China. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including:\n\u25cf changes in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n\u25cf confiscatory taxation;\n\u25cf restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies and export tariff; and\n\u25cf expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two (2) decades, we cannot assure you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social life.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could adversely affect us.\nWe conduct our business through our subsidiaries and controlled companies in the PRC. Our operations in China are governed by Chinese laws and regulations. We are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to WFOE. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.\nSince 1979, Chinese legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China against us or our management based on United States or other foreign laws.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our business through our subsidiaries and controlled companies in the PRC. In addition, all of our operating assets are located in, and all of our other senior executive officers reside within, China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China upon those of our senior executive officers and directors that do not reside in the United States, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, our Chinese counsel has advised us that China does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts. As a result, our public shareholders may face substantially more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management or directors than would shareholders of a corporation with assets and management located in the United States.\nWe may need to obtain additional governmental approvals to open new drugstores. Our inability to obtain such approvals will have a material adverse effect on our business and growth.\nAccording to the Measures on the Administration of Foreign Investment in the Commercial Sector (the \u201cMeasures\u201d) promulgated by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (the \u201cMOC\u201d), which became effective on June 1, 2004, a company that is directly owned by a foreign invested enterprise needs to obtain relevant governmental approvals before it opens new retail stores. However, there are no specific laws, rules or regulations with respect to whether such approvals are necessary for a company that is contractually controlled by a foreign invested enterprise. In addition, the Measures state that the MOC will promulgate a detailed implementation regulation to govern foreign invested enterprises engaging in drug sale. However, such implementation regulation has not yet been promulgated. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that the MOC will not require such approvals to be obtained, or as to when any regulation of such requirements may be implemented. If additional governmental approvals are deemed to be necessary and we are unable to obtain such approvals on a timely basis or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock, will be materially and adversely affected.\nThe advent of recent healthcare reform directives from China\u2019s central government may increase both competition and our cost of doing business.\nUnder the auspices of the Healthy China 2020 program (the \u201cProgram\u201d), published by China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission in October 2008, the central government has set in motion a series of policies in fairly rapid succession aimed to improve China\u2019s healthcare system. Such policies include (1) discouraging hospitals from both prescribing and dispensing medication, (2) the unveiling in April 2009 of formal healthcare reform guidelines aimed at improving the availability of and subsidies for \u201cessential\u201d drugs, and (3) the announcement in August 2009 of China\u2019s National Essential Drugs List (\u201cNEDL\u201d), initially listing approximately three hundred (300) medicines to be sold at government-controlled prices. While an underlying goal of these policies is to make drugs more accessible to China\u2019s poorer population, these policies also serve to create opportunities that in turn will intensify business competition in the Chinese retail drugstore industry, as well as competition for skilled labor and retail spaces. Additionally, we expect the NEDL to result in a rise in the number of government-subsidized community healthcare service centers, which in turn may erode the convenience and price advantage that our drugstores traditionally enjoy against hospitals.\nThe PRC\u2019s labor law restricts our ability to reduce our workforce in the PRC in the event of an economic downturn and may increase our production costs.\nIn June 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of the PRC enacted new labor law legislation called the Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008 (the \u201cLC Law\u201d). The LC Law formalized workers\u2019 rights concerning overtime hours, pensions, layoffs, employment contracts and the role of trade unions. Considered one of the strictest labor laws in the world, among other things, the LC Law provides for specific standards and procedures for the termination of an employment contract and places the burden of proof on the employer. In addition, the law requires the payment of a statutory severance pay upon the termination of an employment contract in most cases, including the case of the expiration of a fixed-term employment contract. Further, the LC Law requires an employer to conclude an \u201cemployment contract without a fixed-term\u201d with any employee who either has worked for the same employer for ten (10) consecutive years or more or has had two (2) consecutive fixed-term contracts with the same employer. An \u201cemployment contract without a fixed term\u201d can no longer be terminated on the ground of the expiration of the contract, although it can still be terminated pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth under the new law. Because of the lack of implementing rules for the LC Law and the precedents for the enforcement of such a law, the standards and procedures set forth under the LC Law in relation to the termination of an employment contract have raised concerns among foreign investment enterprises in the PRC that such \u201cemployment contract without a fixed term\u201d might in fact become a \u201clifetime, permanent employment contract.\u201d Finally, under the LC Law, downsizing of either more than twenty (20) people or more than ten percent (10%) of the workforce may occur only under specified circumstances, such as a restructuring undertaken pursuant to the PRC\u2019s Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, or where a company suffers serious difficulties in production and/or business operations, or where there has been a material change in the objective economic circumstances relied upon by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the employment contract, thereby making the performance of such employment contract impossible. To date, there has been very little guidance and precedent as to how such specified circumstances for downsizing will be interpreted and enforced by the relevant PRC authorities. All of our employees working for us exclusively within the PRC are covered by the LC Law and thus, our ability to adjust the size of our operations when necessary in periods of recession or less severe economic downturns may be curtailed. Accordingly, if we face future periods of decline in business activity generally or adverse economic periods specific to our business, the LC Law can be expected to exacerbate the adverse effect of the economic environment on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions.\nFluctuations in the value of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. The change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar is affected by, among other things, changes in PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current structure, our income is primarily derived from payments from the three (3) HJ Group companies. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries and our PRC affiliated entities to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing Chinese foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Chinese government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our stockholders.\nFrom 1995 until July 2005, the People\u2019s Bank of China intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately Renminbi 8.3 per U.S. dollar. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the Renminbi versus the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy caused the Renminbi to appreciate approximately 21.5% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. As a consequence, the Renminbi has fluctuated sharply since July 2008 against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and when and how it may change again. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Significant revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from securities offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In August 2015, the PRC Government devalued its currency by approximately 3%, represented the largest yuan depreciation for 20 years. Concerns remain that China\u2019s slowing economy, and in particular its exports, will need a stimulus that can only come from further cuts in the exchange rate.\nFluctuations in the value of RMB may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Our revenues, costs, and financial assets are mostly denominated in RMB, while our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, this may result in gains or losses from currency translation on our financial statements. We rely entirely on fees paid to us by our affiliated entities in China. Therefore, any significant fluctuation in the value of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings, financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our stock in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes, make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to us. An appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency translation gains for financial reporting purposes when we translate our RMB denominated financial assets into U.S. dollars, as the U.S. dollar is our reporting currency.\nIn addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollars without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. The income statements of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss, which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all.\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service are subject to restrictions on making payments to us.\nWe rely substantially on our contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service for our revenue. The Chinese government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of China. We may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency. Furthermore, if these companies incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to make payments. If we are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through these contractual arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common shares.\nDividends we receive from our subsidiaries located in the PRC may be subject to PRC withholding tax.\nThe EIT Law provides that a maximum income tax rate of twenty percent (20%) is applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors that are \u201cnon-resident enterprises,\u201d to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. However, the State Council has reduced such rate to ten percent (10%) through the implementation regulations. We are a Nevada holding company and substantially all of our income is derived from our subsidiaries and controlled companies located in the PRC. Therefore, dividends paid to us from China may be subject to the ten percent (10%) income tax if we are considered a \u201cnon-resident enterprise\u201d under the EIT Law. If we are required to pay income tax for any dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries under the EIT Law and its implementation regulations, it may have a material and adverse effect on our net income and materially reduce the amount of dividends, if any, we may pay to our shareholders.\nWe face risks related to disease epidemics and other outbreaks.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of disease outbreaks. Any prolonged recurrence of any adverse public health developments in China may have a material adverse effect on our business operations. For instance, health or other government regulations adopted in response may require temporary closure of our stores or offices. Such closures would severely disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future epidemic outbreak.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur in the PRC. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment in the PRC, giving them an advantage in securing business, which would put us at a disadvantage. We cannot provide assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times in recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between the two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is not permitted to be subject to inspection by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and consequently investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit reports included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and applicable professional standards. Our auditor is located in China and the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections on auditors in China without the approval of the PRC authorities. Therefore, our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is currently not inspected by the PCAOB.\nIn May 2013, the PCAOB announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) on Enforcement Cooperation with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the \u201cCSRC\u201d) and the Ministry of Finance (the \u201cMOF\u201d). The MOU establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations in both countries\u2019 respective jurisdictions. More specifically, it provides a mechanism for the parties to request and receive from each other assistance in obtaining documents and information in furtherance of their investigative duties. In addition to developing enforcement MOU, the PCAOB has been engaged in continuing discussions with the CSRC and MOF to permit joint inspections in China of audit firms that are registered with the PCAOB and audit Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges.\nInspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, and such deficiencies may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of independent registered public accounting firms operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures, and to the extent that such inspections might have facilitated improvements in our auditor\u2019s audit procedures and quality control procedures, investors may be deprived of such benefits.\nThe slowing economic growth in China may assert a negative impact on our operation and financial results.\nAccording to several articles published by the Wall Street Journal, CNN, and BBC News in January 2016, after experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, China\u2019s economy has been hit by shrinking foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a painful slowdown in the last two years. In 2016, China\u2019s economy grew by 6.7%, compared with 6.9% a year earlier, marking its slowest growth in a quarter of a century. As the government tried to shift the growth engine away from manufacturing and debt-fueled investment toward the services sector and consumer spending, the outlook of the Chinese economy is uncertain.\nIn the next two to three years, China\u2019s growth performance could deteriorate because of the overhang of its real estate bubble, massive manufacturing overcapacity, and the lack of new growth engines. The International Monetary Fund expected China\u2019s economy to grow by 6.4% in 2018-2020. If China\u2019s economy slows down further, it may negatively affect our business operation and financial results.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nTo date, we have not paid any cash dividends and no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends. We intend to retain all earnings for our operations.\nNASDAQ may delist our common stock from trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market for failing to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOn May 9, 2013, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), notifying us of our failure to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 over the then preceding thirty (30) consecutive trading days for its common stock, as required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d). The letter stated that the company had until November 5, 2013, to demonstrate compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days. In the meantime, we were included in a list of non-compliant companies posted on NASDAQ\u2019s website commencing on May 16, 2013.\nOn November 6, 2013, NASDAQ granted us an additional 180-day period, or until May 5, 2014, to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. Under NASDAQ Listing Rules, we were granted this extension because we met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable NASDAQ listing requirements, except the bid price requirement.\nOn January 16, 2014, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us that we had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule, as the closing bid price of our common stock had been at or above $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive trading days. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will remain compliant with the Bid Price Rule in the future. If NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAlthough publicly traded, the trading market in our common stock may be substantially less liquid than the average stock quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, and such low trading volume may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market since April 22, 2010, the historical trading volume of our common stock has generally been low. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to you.\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile, and such volatility may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile and, when compared to seasoned issuers, subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf conditions in the retail pharmacy markets;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other retail pharmacy operators;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar;\n\u25cf intellectual property litigation; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in China.\nAs an illustration of such volatility, the closing price of our common stock during the fifty two (52) weeks preceding the date of this report ranged from a low of $1.17 to a high of $2.73. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nIn the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nTechniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small-cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from the difference in the sale price of the borrowed securities and the purchase price of the replacement shares. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, there have been incidents of short sellers publishing, or arranging to publish negative opinions in order to create negative market momentum. While traditionally these disclosed shorts have been limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog (\u201cblogging\u201d) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company\u2019s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called research reports that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, resulted in the selling of shares in the market, on occasion on a large scale and broad base. Issuers with business operations based in the PRC, that have limited trading volumes and that are susceptible to higher volatility levels than U.S. domestic large-cap stocks can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks.\nThese short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the SEC in Regulation Analyst Certification and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortion of the actual facts or, in some cases, fabrication of the facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed shorts will continue to issue such reports.\nWhile we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attacks, oftentimes we are constrained, either by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law (often called Anti-SLAPP statutes), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller. You should be aware that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy - oftentimes blogging from outside the U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements - should we be targeted for such an attack and the rumors not dismissed by market participants, our stock will likely suffer from a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in market price.\nOur officers and directors own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which will enable them to influence many significant corporate actions and in certain circumstances may prevent a change in control that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders.\nAs of June 28, 2019, our directors and executive officers collectively controlled approximately 9,244,482 or 28.6% of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on all corporate actions. These stockholders, acting together, could have a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of the shareholders, including the election of our directors and most of our corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change in our control, even if these actions would benefit us and our shareholders. This control could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights for our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur bylaws contain specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and shareholders, and we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and any costs resulting therefrom may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders.\nLegislative actions, potential new accounting pronouncements and higher insurance costs may impact our future financial position and results of operations.\nOver the last decade or so, there have been many regulatory changes, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. There may potentially be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings or changes that will have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations. In addition, insurers are likely to increase premiums as a result of high claims rates over the past several years, which we expect will increase our premiums for insurance policies. These and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles, and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nWe are subject to reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws. The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as amended, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We reported certain material weaknesses involving control activities, specifically internal control weaknesses relating to finance personnel, in light of the continuing lack of sufficient experience by our accounting staff in U.S. GAAP-based reporting and SEC rules and regulations. Such material weaknesses were noted for the past five (5) fiscal years, based on factors including: (i) the number of adjustments proposed by our independent auditors during our quarterly review and annual audit processes; (ii) the significance of the audit adjustments and their impact on the overall financial statements; (iii) how appropriately we complied with U.S. GAAP on transactions; and (iv) how accurately we prepared supporting information to provide to our independent auditors on a quarterly and annual basis. As such, we did not maintain effective controls and did not implement adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure that significant internal control deficiencies could be detected and/or prevented.\nAlthough we believe that we have made significant efforts to address the foregoing weaknesses, we believe that our efforts to date have not yet been sufficient to fully remediate such weaknesses. We will continue our efforts during the current fiscal year, although there can be no assurance that compliance will be achieved in this time frame.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.", "PERMNO": 93347, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "CJJD"}
