{"cik": "1530804", "company": "Tronox Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur pending acquisition of the Cristal TiO2 Business may not be consummated, and failure to complete the Cristal TiO2 Business acquisition could impact our stock price and financial results.\nOn February 21, 2017, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire the titanium dioxide business (the \u201cCristal TiO2 Business\u201d) of The National Titanium Dioxide Co. Limited (\u201cCristal\u201d). Completion of the Cristal transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including approval of a majority of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares voting at a general meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders with respect to the issuance of Class A ordinary shares of the Company (the \u201cConsideration Shares\u201d) to Cristal and certain regulatory approvals.\nThe transaction agreement provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants that are subject, in some cases, to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the transaction agreement. We expect the Cristal transaction to close before first quarter 2018. There can be no assurance, however, that all closing conditions for the Cristal transaction will be satisfied and, if they are satisfied, that they will be satisfied in time for the closing to occur by May 21, 2018, at which time either party to the transaction agreement may terminate the transaction agreement if the Cristal transaction has not closed by such time. The cash portion of the consideration in the transaction is expected to be funded through proceeds from asset sales, including the Company\u2019s Alkali business and selected other non-core assets if appropriate, and cash on hand. The proceeds from, and completion of, these asset sales may not occur or be insufficient to fund the cash consideration for the Cristal transaction, in which case we may seek third-party debt financing. There can be no assurance as to the terms or availability of such third-party debt financing, and if such debt financing is not available, it may affect our ability to close the Cristal transaction. The Cristal transaction is conditioned on the Company obtaining financing sufficient to fund the cash consideration, and the transaction agreement provides that the Company must pay to Cristal a termination fee of $100 million if all conditions to closing, other than the financing condition, have been satisfied and the transaction agreement is terminated because closing of the Cristal transaction has not occurred by May 21, 2018.\nIf the acquisition of the Cristal TiO2 Business is not completed or our financing for the acquisition becomes unavailable, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndepending on the reasons for the failure to complete the Cristal TiO2 Business acquisition we could be liable to Cristal for a termination fee or other damages in connection with the termination or breach of the transaction agreement;\n\u00b7\nwe have dedicated and we expect we will continue to commit significant time and resources, financial and otherwise, in planning for the acquisition and the associated integration;\n\u00b7\nwe are responsible for reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by Cristal, not to exceed $15 million, relating to the Cristal TiO2 Business acquisition, if the transaction is terminated due to a failure to obtain the required Company shareholder vote regarding the issuance of the Consideration Shares; and\n\u00b7\nwhile the transaction agreement is in effect prior to closing the Cristal transaction, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies.\nIn addition, if the Cristal TiO2 Business acquisition is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. If the acquisition is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, as well as the price of our Class A ordinary shares.\nConcentrated ownership of our ordinary shares by Cristal and Exxaro may prevent minority shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nFollowing the closing of the Cristal TiO2 Business acquisition, Cristal Inorganic Chemicals Netherlands Co\u00f6peratief W.A. (\u201cCristal Inorganic\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cristal, will own approximately 24% of the outstanding ordinary shares (including both our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares) of the Company. Following the closing of the Cristal transaction, Exxaro will own approximately 35% of the Company\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares (including both our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares).\nIndex\nCristal Inorganic and Exxaro may be able to influence fundamental corporate matters and transactions, including mergers or acquisitions (subject to prior board approval)\u037e the sale of all or substantially all of our assets\u037e in certain circumstances, the amendment of our Constitution\u037e and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership, may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other shareholders. The interests of Cristal Inorganic and Exxaro may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. Also, Cristal Inorganic and Exxaro may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other shareholders or adversely affect us or our other shareholders.\nIn addition, under the shareholders agreement, to be entered into upon the closing of the Cristal TiO2 Business acquisition (the \u201cCristal Shareholders Agreement\u201d), among the Company, on the one hand, and Cristal, Cristal Inorganic and the three shareholders of Cristal, on the other hand (collectively, the \u201cCristal Shareholders\u201d), as long as the Cristal Shareholders, collectively, beneficially own at least 28,185,000 or more of Class A ordinary shares, they will have the right to designate for nomination two Class A directors of the Board and, as long as they beneficially own at least 15,568,333 Class A ordinary shares but less than 28,185,000 Class A ordinary shares, they will have the right to designate for nomination one Class A director of the Board. The Cristal Shareholders Agreement also will provide that as long as the Cristal Shareholders own at least 11,743,750 Class A ordinary shares, they will be granted certain preemptive rights. Also under the Cristal Shareholders Agreement, the Company has agreed to file promptly after the closing of the acquisition a registration statement covering approximately four percent of the then-outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, which may be sold as soon as such registration statement is effective. Other than with respect to those shares, the Cristal Shareholders Agreement will include restrictions on Cristal Inorganic\u2019s ability to transfer any of its Class A Shares for a period of three years after the closing of the acquisition other than to certain permitted transferees after the later of eighteen months and the resolution of all indemnification claims under the transaction agreement. The Cristal Shareholders Agreement will also contain certain demand and piggy-back registration rights, which commence after the three-year transfer restriction period expires. Exxaro\u2019s rights under our Constitution and Shareholder\u2019s Deed will remain unchanged following the Cristal transaction.\nAs a result of these or other factors, the market price of our Class A ordinary shares could decline. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant shareholders.\nWe may not be able to realize anticipated benefits of the Cristal transaction, including expected synergies, earnings per share accretion or EBITDA and free cash flow growth and we will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of the pending Cristal transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost synergies, earnings per share accretion or EBITDA and free cash flow growth. Our success in realizing these benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the pending Cristal transaction that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all.\nThere is also the possibility that:\n\u25cf\nthe acquisition may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies and cultures;\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business; and\n\u25cf\nproblems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Cristal transaction on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Cristal transaction is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause our customers, suppliers and other business partners to delay or defer certain business decisions or to seek to change existing business relationships with us. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following the closing of the Cristal transaction.\nIndex\nMarket conditions, as well as global and regional economic downturns that adversely affect the demand for our end-use products could adversely affect the profitability of our operations and the prices at which we can sell our products, negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur TiO2 segment revenue and profitability is dependent on direct sales of TiO2 to end user customers and sales of TiO2 feedstock to TiO2 producers, while our Alkali segment revenue and profitability is dependent on sales of soda ash products to customers. TiO2 and soda ash are chemicals used in many \u201cquality of life\u201d products for which demand historically has been linked to global, regional and local GDP and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic and market conditions. Such events can cause a decrease in demand for our products and market prices to fall which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities that reprice as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to vary with changes in the business cycle. Our TiO2 prices may do so in the near term as ore prices and pigment prices are expected to fluctuate in the short term and over the next few years.\nA significant portion of the demand for our products comes from manufacturers of paint and plastics, glass manufacturers, and other industrial customers. Companies that operate in the industries that these industries serve, including the automotive, construction and glass container industries, may experience significant fluctuations in demand for their own end products because of economic conditions, changes in consumer demand, or increases in raw material and energy costs. In addition, many large end users of our products depend upon the availability of credit on favorable terms to make purchases of raw materials such as soda ash and TiO2. As interest rates increase or if our customers\u2019 creditworthiness deteriorates, this credit may be expensive or difficult to obtain. If these customers cannot obtain credit on favorable terms, they may be forced to reduce their purchases. These and other factors may lead some customers to seek renegotiation or cancellation of their arrangements with our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, Chinese producers are significant participants in both the TiO2 and Alkali markets and Chinese exports while suffering from a number of disadvantages can also affect demand and the price for our products.\nTiO2 pigment and feedstock and soda ash prices have been and in the future may be volatile. Price declines for our products will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAdditionally, historically, the global market and, to a lesser extent, the domestic market for TiO2 pigment and feedstock and soda ash have been volatile, and those markets are likely to remain volatile in the future. Prices for TiO2 pigment and feedstock and soda ash may fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these products, market uncertainty and other factors beyond our control.\nFactors that affect the price of our products include, among other things:\n\u25cf\noverall economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe level of customer demand, including in the glassmaking, paint and plastics industries;\n\u25cf\nthe level of production and exports of our products globally;\n\u25cf\nthe level of production and cost of materials used to produce TiO2 and soda ash, including trona ore or synthetic materials, globally;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of energy consumed in the production of TiO2 and soda ash, including the price of natural gas, electricity and coal;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of competitors increasing their capacity and exports;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental relations, regulations and taxes; and\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions or hostilities and unrest in regions where we export our TiO2 products or where we export soda ash directly or through ANSAC.\nTiO2 pigment pricing pressure and volatility in soda ash prices can make it difficult to predict the cash we may have on hand at any given time, and a prolonged period of price declines may materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations.\nIndex\nThe markets for many of our TiO2 products have seasonally affected sales patterns.\nThe demand for TiO2 during a given year is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Because TiO2 is widely used in paint and other coatings, titanium feedstocks are in higher demand prior to the painting season in the Northern Hemisphere (spring and summer), and pig iron is in lower demand during the European summer holidays, when many steel plants and foundries undergo maintenance. Zircon generally is a non-seasonal product; however, it is negatively impacted by the winter and Chinese New Year celebrations due to reduced zircon demand from China. We may be adversely affected by existing or future cyclical changes, and such conditions may be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated changes in regional weather conditions. For example, poor weather conditions in a region can lead to an abbreviated painting season, which can depress consumer sales of paint products that use TiO2.\nIncreased use of glass substitutes and recycled glass may affect demand for soda ash, which could adversely affect our result of operations.\nIncreased use of glass substitutes or recycled glass in the container industry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Container glass production is one of the principal end markets for soda ash. Competition from increased use of glass substitutes, such as plastic and recycled glass, has had a negative effect on demand for soda ash. We believe that the use of containers containing alternative materials such as plastic and aluminum could negatively affect the growth in demand for soda ash.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of our operating entities outside the United States are reported in various foreign currencies, primarily the South African Rand, Australian Dollars and Euros, and then converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements. As a result, any volatility of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies creates uncertainty for and may have a negative impact on reported sales and operating margin. We have made a U.S. dollar functional currency election for both Australian financial reporting and federal income tax purposes. On this basis, our Australian entities report their results of operations on a U.S. dollar basis. In addition, our operating entities often need to convert currencies they receive for their products into currencies in which they purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates.\nIn order to manage this risk, we may, from time to time, enter into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies.\nOur operations may be negatively impacted by inflation.\nOur profits and financial condition could be adversely affected when cost inflation is not offset by devaluation in operating currencies or an increase in the price of our products. Our operations have been affected by inflation in the countries in which they have operated in recent years. Working costs and wages in South Africa and Australia have increased in recent years, resulting in significant cost pressures for the mining industry.\nAs an emerging market, South Africa poses a challenging array of long-term political, economic, financial and operational risks.\nSouth Africa has continued undergoing political and economic challenges and the local currency has devalued significantly over recent years. Changes to or instability in the economic or political environment in South Africa, especially if such changes create political instability, actual or potential shortages of production materials or labor unrest, could result in production delays and production shortfalls, and materially impact our production and results of operations.\nIn South Africa, our mining and smelting operations depend on electrical power generated by Eskom, the state-owned sole energy supplier. South African electricity prices have risen during the past few years, and future increases are likely. Additionally, our KZN Sands operations currently use approximately 245,000 gigajoules of Sasol gas, which is available only from Sasol Limited; however, we could replace approximately 30% to 44% of our current Sasol gas usage with furnace off-gas produced by KZN Sands, if necessary. In order to reduce demand across South Africa, Eskom introduced \u201cload shedding\u201d at certain times in the past year, meaning that on a regular basis certain areas would be without power for a specified number of hours.\nWe use significant amounts of water in our operations, which could impose significant costs. Use of water in South Africa is governed by water-use licenses. Our KZN mining operation in South Africa uses water to transport the slimes or sand from reclaimed areas to the processing plant and to the tailings facilities. Additionally, South Africa is currently experiencing a drought resulting in water restrictions being imposed in certain areas, including the KZN region. A prolonged drought in South Africa may lead to continued, or more severe water restrictions, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Under South African law, our South African mining operations are subject to water-use licenses that govern each operation. These licenses require, among other conditions, that mining operations achieve and maintain certain water quality limits for all water discharges, where applicable. Our South African operations that came into existence after the adoption of the National Water Act, No. 36 of 1998 have applied for and been issued the required water-use licenses. However, changes to water-use licenses could affect our operational results and financial condition.\nIndex\nThe South African government may intervene in mining through various means including increased taxation, greater control and conditions on the distribution of mineral rights, poverty alleviation, and job creation. Such measures have not yet been defined, and the impact the measures may have on our business remains uncertain.\nChanges to the revised MPRDA have been incorporated into the 2013 MPRDA amendment, and are awaiting consideration by the South African Parliament before being promulgated. Some of the proposed changes may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Although we expect the bulk of the original act to remain intact, there could be substantial changes, based on the current draft. This could have adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSouth Africa\u2019s exchange control regulations require resident companies to obtain the prior approval of the South African Reserve Bank to raise capital in any currency other than the Rand, and restrict the export of capital from South Africa. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further change or abolish exchange control measures in the future. These exchange control restrictions could hinder our financial and strategic flexibility, particularly our ability to use South African capital to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and new projects outside of South Africa.\nOur operations in South Africa are reliant on services provided by the state agency, Transnet, for limited rail transport services at Namakwa Sands. Furthermore, they provide extensive dock-side services at both the ports of Richards Bay and Saldanha Bay. Delays, particularly those caused by industrial actions, could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSouth African law governs the payment of compensation and medical costs to a compensation fund against which mining employees and other people at sites where ancillary mining activities are conducted can claim for mining activity-related illnesses or injuries. Should claims against the compensation fund rise significantly due to our mining activity or if claims against us are not covered by the compensation fund, the amount of our contribution or liability to claimants may increase, which could adversely impact our financial condition. In addition, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa poses risks to our South African operations in terms of potentially reduced productivity, and increased medical and other costs. If there is a significant increase in the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection and related diseases among the South African workforce over the next several years, our operations, projects and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur flexibility in managing our labor force maybe adversely affected by labor and employment laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, many of which are more onerous than those of the United States; and some of our labor force has substantial workers' council or trade union participation, which creates a risk of disruption from labor disputes and new laws affecting employment policies.\nLabor costs constituted approximately 30% of our production costs in 2016. The majority of our employees are located outside the United States. In most of those countries, labor and employment laws are more onerous than in the United States and, in many cases, grant significant job protection to employees, including rights on termination of employment.\nAt our Green River, Wyoming facility, most of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In South Africa, over 70% of our workforce belongs to a union. In Australia, most employees are not currently represented by a union, but approximately 45% are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. In the Netherlands, approximately 60% of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and 30% are members of a union.\nOur South African operations have entered into various agreements regulating wages and working conditions at our mines. There have been periods when various stakeholders have been unable to agree on dispute resolution processes, leading to threats of disruptive labor disputes, although only two strikes have ever occurred in the history of these operations. Due to the high level of employee union membership, our South African operations are at risk of production stoppages for indefinite periods due to strikes and other labor disputes. Although we believe that we have good labor relations with our South African employees, we may experience labor disputes in the future.\nSouth African employment law, which is based on the minimum standard set by the International Labour Organization, sets out minimum terms and conditions of employment for employees. Although these may be improved by agreements between an employer and the trade unions, prescribed minimum terms and conditions form the benchmark for all employment contracts. Our South African operations are required to submit a report to the South African Department of Labour under South African employment law detailing the progress made towards achieving employment equity in the workplace. Failing to submit this report in a timely manner could result in substantial penalties. In addition, future legislative developments that affect South African employment policies may increase production costs or negatively impact relationships with employees and trade unions, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIndex\nWe are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of, various employee groups or works\u2019 councils that represent our employees for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes.\nGiven the nature of our chemical, mining and smelting operations, we face a material risk of liability, delays and increased cash costs of production from environmental and industrial accidents and operational breakdowns.\nOur business involves significant risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, and breakdowns of equipment and machinery. Our business is exposed to hazards associated with chemical process manufacturing and the related storage, handling and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes, and our furnace operations that are subject to explosions, water ingress and refractory failure, and our open pit and dredge mining operations that are subject to flooding and accidents associated with rock transportation equipment and conveyor belts. We mine our soda ash in underground mines where our mining methods result in the release of significant amount of methane which must be removed from the mine by ventilation to ensure safe operations. Our underground mining and related processing activities at our soda ash operations are subject to the danger of underground fires and explosions and present inherent risks of injury to persons and damage to equipment. Furthermore, during operational breakdowns, the relevant facility may not be fully operational within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in further business losses. The occurrence of any of these or other hazards could delay production, suspend operations, increase repair, maintenance or medical costs and, due to the integration of our facilities, could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on our business as a whole. Over our operating history, we have incurred incidents of this nature. Although insurance policies provide limited coverage for these risks, such policies will not fully cover some of these risks.\nThere is also a risk that our key raw materials or our products may be found to have currently unrecognized toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees. Such hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which could lead to government fines or work stoppage injunctions and lawsuits by injured persons. If such actions are required, we may have inadequate insurance to cover such claims, or insufficient cash flow to pay for such claims. Such outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mining activities in Wyoming result in measurable subsidence of the surface above our underground mine workings. We have successfully managed the effect of subsidence so as not to adversely affect other uses of the surface for roads, pipelines and grazing. Should we fail to manage the effects of such subsidence in the future or if regulators and local stakeholders force changes in our mining operations to reduce subsidence further, the results of operations of our business could be adversely affected.\nEquipment upgrades, equipment failures and deterioration of assets may lead to production curtailments, shutdowns or additional expenditures.\nOur operations depend upon critical equipment that require scheduled upgrades and maintenance and may suffer unanticipated breakdowns or failures. As a result, our mining operations and processing may be interrupted or curtailed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, assets critical to our mining and chemical processing operations may deteriorate due to wear and tear or otherwise sooner than we currently estimate. Such deterioration may result in additional maintenance spending and additional capital expenditures. If these assets do not generate the amount of future cash flows that we expect, and we are not able to refurbish them or procure replacement assets in an economically feasible manner, our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf any of the equipment on which we depend were severely damaged or were destroyed by fire, abnormal wear and tear, flooding, or otherwise, we may be unable to replace or repair it in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability to produce and ship our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIndex\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nAll of our operations are conducted and all of our assets are owned by our operating companies, which are our subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations at the operating companies and any future subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or make cash distributions depends upon the cash flow of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries, and the payment of funds by our operating companies and any future subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise. The ability of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, or indentures, and legal restrictions regarding the transfer of funds.\nOur ability to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate and increase cash flow, and our access to additional liquidity sources. Our ability to generate and increase cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe impact of competition from other chemical and materials manufacturers and diversified companies;\n\u25cf\nthe transfer of funds from subsidiaries in the United States to certain foreign subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\ngeneral world business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn and the significant downturn in housing construction and overall economies;\n\u25cf\nthe selling price of our products;\n\u25cf\npolitical and social instability;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher raw material costs;\n\u25cf\nour ability to adequately deliver customer service and competitive product quality;\n\u25cf\ntariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers; and\n\u25cf\nthe effects of governmental regulation on our business.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. A general economic downturn can result in reduced spending by customers, which will impact our revenues and cash flows from operating activities. At reduced performance, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our existing debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.\nOur industry and the end-use markets in which we compete are highly competitive. This competition may adversely affect our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nEach of our markets is highly competitive. Competition in TiO2 segment industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face significant competition from major international and smaller regional competitors. Our most significant competitors include major chemical and materials manufacturers and diversified companies, a number of which have substantially larger financial resources, greater personnel, and larger facilities than we do. We also compete with numerous smaller, regional producers as well as Chinese producers that have significantly expanded their sulphate TiO2 production capacity in recent years and have also commenced the commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology.\nZircon producers generally compete on the basis of price, quality, logistics, delivery, and payment terms and consistency of supply. Although we believe we have competitive quality, long-term relationships with customers and product range, our primary competitive disadvantage relative to our major competitors is our distance from our main consumers (i.e., Asia and Europe).\nWithin the end-use markets in which we compete, competition between products is intense. We face substantial risk that certain events, such as new product development by competitors, changing customer needs, the commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology, production advances for competing products, or price changes in raw materials, could cause our customers to switch to our competitors\u2019 products. If we are unable to develop and produce or market our products to compete effectively against our competitors following such events, our results of operations and operating cash flows may suffer.\nIndex\nProducers of alkali-products compete based on price, logistics costs and consistent customer service. If we do not maintain Alkali\u2019s favorable cost position vis-\u00e0-vis foreign manufacturers using synthetic production methods, or our cost position relative to our North American competitors, our ability to maintain favorable pricing and market share will erode and our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nAn increase in the price of energy or other raw materials, or an interruption in our energy or other raw material supply, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mining and production processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which can be subject to worldwide, as well as, local supply and demand, as well as other factors beyond our control. In 2016, raw materials used in the production of TiO2 constituted approximately 45% of our operating expenses. Fuel and energy linked to commodities, such as diesel, heavy fuel oil and coal, and other consumables, such as chlorine, illuminating paraffin, electrodes, and anthracite, consumed in our TiO2 manufacturing and mining operations form an important part of our TiO2 operating costs. We have no control over the costs of these consumables, many of which are linked to some degree to the price of oil and coal, and the costs of many of these raw materials may fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability, major capacity additions or reductions, or significant facility operating problems. These fluctuations could negatively affect our TiO2 operating margins, our profitability or planned capital expenditures. As these costs rise, our operating expenses will increase and could adversely affect our business, especially if we are unable to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers.\nOur Alkali business relies on two fuel sources as the main energy source in its soda ash production process: coal and natural gas. Natural gas prices, and to a lesser extent, coal prices have historically been volatile. The coal industry is under regulatory pressure in the United States, which depending on the direction of such regulations could affect the future availability and cost of coal used in our operations. We receive coal by rail and truck from a single mine in Western Wyoming under a long term contract. Any disruption at this coal mine or an unexpected increase in the costs of transporting coal to our facility could adversely affect our future results of operations. Furthermore, the price of natural gas could increase as a result of reduced domestic drilling and production activity. Drilling and production operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulations concerning, among other things, emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases, hydraulic fracturing, and the handling of natural gas and other substances used in connection with natural gas operations, such as drilling fluids and wastewater. In addition, natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxation. More stringent legislation, regulation or taxation of natural gas drilling activity in the United States could directly curtail such activity or increase the cost of drilling, resulting in reduced levels of drilling activity and therefore increased natural gas prices.\nAdditionally, any material increase in energy or other raw material prices could adversely impact our operations by making us less competitive. With respect to our Alkali business, if U.S. energy prices were to increase to a level where foreign soda ash producers were able improve their competitive position on a unit cost basis, this would negatively affect our competitive cost position.\nA substantial portion of the delivered cost of soda ash to a customer is attributable to transportation and freight costs. Increases in freight costs or a change in rail policies on reimbursement for fleet costs could increase our costs significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nTransportation costs represent a substantial portion of the total delivered cost of soda ash to the customer. While our soda ash pricing typically does not include freight charges, the Alkali business arranges for transportation of its soda ash by rail or truck to domestic customers, meaning that the competitive position of the business can be affected by changes in transportation costs or any change in the ways with which railroads incent us to maintain our rail fleet such as by payment of mileage credits. ANSAC prices soda ash on a delivered price basis, meaning that changes in transportation costs, rail and ocean freight, has a direct impact on the prices paid by ANSAC for our soda ash. As a result, our business and financial results are sensitive to increases in rail freight, trucking and ocean vessel rates. Increases in transportation costs, including increases resulting from emission control requirements, port taxes and fluctuations in the price of fuel, could make soda ash a less competitive product for glass manufacturers when compared to glass substitutes or recycled glass, or could make Alkali\u2019s soda ash less competitive than soda ash produced by competitors that have other means of transportation or are located closer to their customers. We may be unable to pass on its freight and other transportation costs in full because market prices for soda ash are determined by supply and demand forces.\nApproximately 90% of the Alkali soda ash is shipped via a single rail line. Interruptions of service on this rail line could adversely affect the results of operations of our Alkali business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Alkali business shipped over 90% of its soda ash from its facility on a single rail line. Rail operations are subject to various risks that may result in a delay or lack of service at Alkali\u2019s manufacturing facility, including mechanical problems, extreme weather conditions, work stoppages, labor strikes, terrorist attacks and operating hazards. Moreover, if our railcar provider\u2019s financial condition was adversely affected, it could decide to cease or suspend service to the facility. If we are unable to ship soda ash by rail, it would be impracticable to ship all of our soda ash by truck and it would be cost-prohibitive to construct a rail connection to the closest alternative rail line. Any delay or failure in the rail services on which we rely could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business, as well as impact our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $3.1 billion. Our credit facilities contain covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u25cf\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf\ncomplete asset sales, acquisitions or mergers;\n\u25cf\nmake investments and capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nprepay other indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf\nfund additional dividends or repurchase shares.\nCertain of our facilities, excluding our $1.5 billion senior secured term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), our $900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2020 (the \u201cSenior Notes due 2020\u201d) and our $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2022 (the \u201cSenior Notes due 2022\u201d), include requirements relating to the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) to indebtedness or certain fixed charges. The breach of any covenants or obligations in our credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations (and cross-defaults to certain other debt obligations) and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger other cross defaults under other future agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default under those credit facilities could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our credit facilities, and could force us to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws.\nA large portion of our shares are owned by a single shareholder, Exxaro.\nAt December 31, 2016, Exxaro held approximately 44% of the voting securities of Tronox Limited, and had three representatives serving as Directors on our nine-member board. Additionally, in the future, Exxaro may exchange its retained interest in the mineral sands business for additional Class B Shares.\nDue to Exxaro\u2019s significant ownership interest, it is entitled to certain rights under the Constitution and the Shareholder\u2019s Deed of Tronox Limited. For example, the Constitution provides that, for as long as the Class B voting interest is at least 10% of the total voting interest in Tronox Limited, there must be nine directors on our board; of which the holders of Class A ordinary shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) will be entitled to vote separately to elect a certain number of directors to our board (which we refer to as Class A Directors), and the holders of Class B Shares will be entitled to vote separately to elect a certain number of directors to our board (which we refer to as Class B Directors). If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 30%, our board will consist of six Class A Directors and three Class B Directors. If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 20% but less than 30%, our board of directors will consist of seven Class A Directors and two Class B Directors. If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 10% but less than 20%, our board will consist of eight Class A Directors and one Class B Director.\nThe Constitution also provides that, subject to certain limitations, for as long as the Class B voting interest is at least 20%, a separate vote by holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares is required to approve certain types of merger or similar transactions that will result in a change in control or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any reorganization or transaction that does not treat Class A and Class B Shares equally.\nUnder the terms of the Shareholder\u2019s Deed entered into upon completion of the Exxaro Transaction, Exxaro has agreed not to acquire any voting shares of Tronox Limited if, following such acquisition, Exxaro will have a voting interest in Tronox Limited of 50% or more unless Exxaro brings any proposal to make such an acquisition to the board of directors of Tronox Limited on a confidential basis. In the event an agreement regarding the proposal is not reached, Exxaro is permitted to make a takeover offer for all the shares of Tronox Limited not held by affiliates of Exxaro provided that binding acceptances are received from a majority of the shares not held by affiliates of Exxaro. Moreover, Exxaro is not contractually obligated to maintain its 44% share ownership in us. Although Exxaro is required to comply with applicable law and our constituent documents (including our Shareholders\u2019 Agreement which sets forth the requirements by which Exxaro is obligated to continue to empower our two South African subsidiaries under BEE legislation), there is no assurance that Exxaro will not reduce its 44% stake in the future through a sale, disposition or other permissible transfer. If Exxaro substantially reduces its ownership interest through a sale, disposition or other permissible transfer which results in the Class B shares converting to Class A shares, the increase in the number of Class A shares outstanding could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nIndex\nAs a result of Exxaro\u2019s significant ownership interest and its governance rights, Exxaro may be able to exert substantial influence over our management, operations and potential significant corporate transactions, including a change in control or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Exxaro\u2019s influence may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nOur South African operations may lose the benefit of the BEE status under South African legislation, resulting in the need to implement a remedial solution or introduce a new minority shareholder, which could negatively impact our South African operations.\nBEE legislation was introduced into South Africa as a means to seek to redress the inequalities of the previous Apartheid system. Under BEE legislation, South African businesses are required to become \u201cempowered\u201d. In order for South African mining companies to be deemed \u201cempowered\u201d, the South African Mining Charter specifies certain requirements that such companies must continually satisfy, including a requirement that at least 26% of the shares in such companies are held by BEE \u201cempowered\u201d entities. Exxaro, a BEE \u201cempowered\u201d company, retains a 26% direct ownership interest in each of Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd and Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd in order for these two entities to comply with the requirements of the MPRDA and the South African Mining Charter ownership requirements under the BEE legislation.\nPursuant to our Shareholders\u2019 Agreement with Exxaro, Exxaro has agreed to maintain its direct ownership for a period of the shorter of the date on which the requirement to maintain a direct ownership stake in each of Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd and Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd no longer applies or June 2022 (unless it transfers the direct ownership interests to another qualified buyer under the BEE legislation. If either Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd or Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd ceases to qualify under the BEE legislation, Tronox Limited and Exxaro have agreed to jointly seek a remedial solution. If Tronox Limited and Exxaro cannot successfully implement a solution and the reason for this failure is due to anything other than a change in law, then we may dispose of Exxaro\u2019s shares in the non-qualifying company to another BEE compliant, qualifying purchaser. During any period of any non-qualification, our South African operations may be in violation of their mining or prospecting rights, as well as the requirements of the MPRDA and the South African Mining Charter, which could result in a suspension or revocation of the non-qualifying company\u2019s mining and prospecting rights and could expose us to operating restrictions, lost business opportunities and delays in receiving further regulatory approvals for our South African operations and expansion activities. In addition, if Exxaro\u2019s direct ownership in Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd and Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd is sold to another purchaser, we could be required to share control of our South African operations with a minority shareholder, which may impact our operational and financial flexibility and could impact profitability, expansion opportunities and our results of operations. The question of whether the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle applies in the mining industry in South Africa is subject to current litigation between the Chamber of Mines and the Department of Mineral Resources. An adverse outcome in connection with such litigation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a draft amendment to the South African Mining Charter was released by the Department of Mineral Resources in April 2016. The proposed revised charter sets forth requirements with regard to continuing ownership of mining rights by BEE entities, the form and percentage of that ownership by BEE partners, procurement from BEE compliant entities, race and gender ownership and employment quotas, and workers\u2019 housing and living conditions. The proposals were opposed by many mining companies and discussions between the government and industry groups commenced. The government has not issued final regulations on these matters and we cannot predict whether any regulations or policies that are ultimately adopted could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nA significant portion of the Alkali business\u2019 international sales of soda ash are to ANSAC, a U.S. export trade association, and therefore adverse developments at ANSAC or its customers, or in any of the markets in which the Alkali Chemicals business makes direct international sales, could adversely affect its ability to compete in certain international markets.\nThe Alkali business, along with two other U.S. trona-based soda ash producers, utilizes ANSAC as its exclusive export vehicle for sales to customers in all countries excluding Canada, the European Community, the European Free Trade Association and the South African Customs Union, which provides us with the benefits of large purchases of soda ash and significant economies of scale in managing international sales and logistics. Because ANSAC makes sales to its end customers directly and then allocates a portion of such sales to each member, we do not have direct access to ANSAC\u2019s customers and we have no direct control over the credit or other terms ANSAC extends to its customers. As a result, we are indirectly vulnerable to ANSAC\u2019s customer relationships and the credit and other terms ANSAC extends to its customers. Any adverse change in ANSAC\u2019s customer relationships could have a direct impact on ANSAC\u2019s ability to make sales and our ability to make sales to ANSAC. In addition, to the extent ANSAC extends credit or other favorable terms to its end customers and those customers subsequently default under sales contracts or otherwise fail to perform, we would have no direct recourse against them.\nIndex\nFurthermore, from time to time international competition authorities have conducted inquiries into ANSAC\u2019s activities. An unfavorable outcome in any such investigation could result in our having to pay fines or penalties, either on our own behalf or as a member of ANSAC, or otherwise adversely affect the ability of ANSAC to continue serving export markets. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in any such investigation, the withdrawal of one of the other two members of ANSAC or the dissolution of ANSAC, we would be forced to use alternative methods to facilitate additional direct export sales of soda ash, resulting in less favorable arrangements in respect of logistics or sales. Any of these developments could lead us to incur significant additional costs and may result in lower pricing for its export sales, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ore resources and reserve estimates are based on a number of assumptions, including mining and recovery factors, future cash costs of production and ore demand and pricing. As a result, ore resources and reserve quantities actually produced may differ from current estimates.\nThe mineral resource and reserve estimates are estimates of the quantity and ore grades in our mines based on the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques, as well as from feasibility studies. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the assumptions and judgments made in interpreting the geological data. The assessment of geographical characteristics, such as location, quantity, quality, continuity of geology and grade, is made with varying degrees of confidence in accordance with established guidelines and standards. We use various exploration techniques, including geophysical surveys and sampling through drilling and trenching, to investigate resources and implement applicable quality assurance and quality control criteria to ensure that data is representative. Our mineral reserves represent the amount of ore that we believe can be economically mined and processed, and are estimated based on a number of factors, which have been stated in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7, the South African Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 2007 version, as amended 2009 (SAMREC) and the Australian code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (2012)(JORC).\nThere is significant uncertainty in any mineral reserve or mineral resource estimate. Factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to secure mineral rights, the sufficiency of mineralization to support mining and beneficiation practices and the suitability of the market may significantly impact mineral resource and reserve estimates. The actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of mining a deposit may differ materially from our estimates. Since these mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on assumptions related to factors discussed above, we may revise these estimates in the future as we become aware of new developments. To maintain TiO2 feedstock production beyond the expected lives of our existing mines or to increase production materially above projected levels, we will need to access additional reserves through exploration or discovery.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or renew leases and permits necessary for our soda ash operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Alkali facilities and operations require us to obtain a number of permits that impose strict regulations on various environmental and operational matters in connection with mining trona ore and producing soda ash products. These include permits issued by various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently and are subject to discretionary interpretations by our regulators, all of which may make compliance difficult or impractical and may impair our existing operations or the development of future facilities. The public, including non-governmental organizations, environmental groups and individuals, have certain statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and environmental impact statements prepared in connection with applicable regulations and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizen\u2019s lawsuits to challenge the issuance or renewal of permits, the validity of environmental impact statements or the performance of mining activities. If permits are not issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all or are conditioned in a manner that restricts our ability to conduct our operations economically, our cash flows may decline, which could limit our ability to pay debt and distribute earnings to shareholders.\nAll of our soda ash reserves are held under leases with the State of Wyoming, the BLM and Anadarko. As of December 31, 2016, leases covering more than 20% of our acreage were scheduled to expire in the next five years. If we are not able to renew our leases, it will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIndex\nIf we are unable to innovate and successfully introduce new products, or new technologies or processes reduce the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell products, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets and on our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets. We must continue to identify, develop and market innovative products or enhance existing products on a timely basis to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. We may be unable to develop new products or technology, either alone or with third parties, or license intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis. If we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, new technologies or processes have the potential to replace or provide lower-cost alternatives to our products, such as new processes that reduce TiO2 in consumer products or the use of chloride slag in the production of TiO2, which could result in TiO2 producers using less chloride slag, or to reduce the need for TiO2 in consumer products, which could depress the demand and pricing for TiO2. With respect to our Alkali business, changing customer requirements could affect demand for our alkali products. Over time, detergent manufacturers have introduced liquid products to replace dry powder detergents that typically include soda ash as a major ingredient. This trend has caused demand for soda ash to fall in this market segment. The growing preference of many food and beverage manufacturers to use plastic containers has reduced the demand for glass containers and the demand for soda ash. Future innovations in glass making, food packaging and detergent manufacture may continue to reduce the demand for soda ash in the future. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, result in a lower demand for our products or affect the competitiveness of our business. We may be required to invest significant resources to adapt to changing technologies, markets and competitive environments.\nWe are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability\nOur operations and production facilities are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions relating to use of natural resources, pollution, protection of the environment, mine site remediation, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products, and storing and disposing of hazardous wastes among other materials. Such laws include, in the U.S., the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Clean Water Act, protecting of air and water resources, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and in the EU, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), for regulation of chemicals in commerce and reporting of potential known adverse effects, and numerous other local, state and federal laws and regulations governing materials transport and packaging. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including Australia and China and there are rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. Additional new laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. For example, TSCA reform was enacted in June 2016, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency will eventually issue new chemical control regulations.\nThe costs of compliance with the extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or the inability to obtain, update or renew permits required for operation or expansion of our business could reduce our profitability or otherwise adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with the conditions of our permits governing the production and management of regulated materials, mineral sands mining licenses or leases or the provisions of the applicable United States, South African or Australian law, these permits, mining licenses or leases and mining rights could be canceled or suspended, and we could be prevented from obtaining new mining and prospecting rights, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws and regulations. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use, or chemicals or mineral products we produce, we could incur material costs as a result of addressing the consequences of such event. In part of the Alkali business that sells specialty products to food and pharmaceutical customers, these risks include potential responsibility for the cost of product recalls, whether ordered by governmental authorities or undertaken voluntarily.\nChanges to existing laws governing operations, especially changes in laws relating to transportation of mineral resources, the treatment of land and infrastructure, contaminated land, the remediation of mines, tax royalties, exchange control restrictions, environmental remediation, mineral rights, ownership of mining assets, or the rights to prospect and mine may have a material adverse effect on our future business operations and financial performance. There is risk that onerous conditions may be attached to authorizations in the form of mining rights, water-use licenses, miscellaneous licenses and environmental approvals, or that the grant of these approvals may be delayed or not granted.\nIndex\nOur current operations involve the production and management of regulated materials that are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and are dependent on obtaining and the periodic renewal of permits from various governmental agencies. The inability to obtain, update or renew permits related to the operation of our businesses, or the costs required in order to comply with permit standards, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMoreover, certain environmental laws impose joint and several, strict liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We are currently addressing certain areas of known contamination on our own properties, none of which we presently anticipate will result in any material costs or adverse impacts on our business or operations. However, we cannot be certain that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party.\nRecent French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (\u201cANSES\u201d) action could result in more stringent regulatory control with respect to TiO2.\nIn May 2016, France\u2019s competent authority under REACH submitted a proposal to the European Chemicals Agency (\"ECHA\") that would classify titanium dioxide as carcinogenic in humans by inhalation. The Company together with other companies and trade associations representing the Titanium Dioxide industry and industries consuming our products, submitted comments opposing the classification, based on evidence from epidemiological and other scientific studies. If the ECHA were to recommend, and the European Commission were to subsequently adopt such a classification, it could require that many products manufactured with titanium dioxide be classified as containing carcinogenic materials, which could negatively impact our business by inhibiting the marketing of products containing titanium dioxide to consumers, and subject our manufacturing operations to new regulations that could significantly increase costs.\nOur dependence on burning coal to generate electrical energy and steam could mean that governmental initiatives to limit the emission of greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) could have an adverse effect in the future on our costs and therefore our results of operations.\nOur U.S.-based operations are also subject to EPA\u2019s regulations regarding GHG emissions and, depending upon the nature and scope of any future regulations, could become subject to additional costs or limitations. Current requirements include an obligation to monitor and report the GHG emissions from our facilities and to comply with the Clean Air Act\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements in connection with any new or modified major sources of GHG emissions. Although we believe our operations are currently in compliance with these obligations, EPA has continued to pursue additional GHG regulations, including the currently proposed Clean Power Plan for existing sources of GHGs in the power generating sector. In addition, several states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, including through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs. Although our facilities are not currently subject to any such program, the expansion or further adoption of such programs in jurisdictions where we operate could impose additional compliance obligations on our facilities. As a result, such programs could result in an increase in fuel or energy costs for our businesses or, if we are directly regulated, an additional cost to acquire necessary allowances. Future costs of compliance with either the existing or future federal or State regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to possible litigation claims, including disputes with competitors, customers, equipment vendors, environmental groups and other non-governmental organizations or NGOs, and providers of shipping services. Some of the lawsuits may seek fines or penalties and damages in large amounts, or seek to restrict our business activities. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or whether insurance claims may mitigate any damages to us. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nExpansion or improvement of our existing facilities may not result in revenue increases and will be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOne of the ways we may grow our business is through the expansion or improvement of our existing facilities. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing facilities involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic uncertainties that are beyond our control. Such expansion or improvement projects may also require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, and financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. As a result, we may not be able to realize our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIndex\nWe compete with other mining and chemical businesses for key human resources in the countries in which we operate, and our business will suffer if we are unable to hire highly skilled employees or if our key officers or employees discontinue employment with us.\nWe compete with other chemical and mining companies, and other companies generally, in the countries in which we operate to attract and retain key human resources at all levels with the appropriate technical skills and operating and managerial experience necessary to continue operating and expanding our businesses. These operations use modern techniques and equipment and accordingly require various types of skilled workers. The success of our business will be materially dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our key officers and skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees is particularly severe in southwestern Wyoming, Western Australia and at Namakwa Sands, which may cost us in terms of higher labor costs or reduced productivity. As a result, we may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees. Should we lose any of our key personnel or fail to attract and retain key qualified personnel or other skilled employees, our business may be harmed and our operational results and financial condition could be affected.\nThere may be difficulty in effecting service of legal process and enforcing judgments against us and our directors and management.\nWe are registered under the laws of Western Australia, Australia, and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, certain members of our board of directors reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon Tronox Limited or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce judgments outside the United States obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States.\nThird parties may develop new intellectual property rights for processes and/or products that we would want to use, but would be unable to do so; or, third parties may claim that the products we make or the processes that we use infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from making, using or selling products we make or require alteration of the processes we use.\nResults of our operations may also be negatively impacted if a competitor develops or has the right to use intellectual property rights for new processes or products and we cannot obtain similar rights on favorable terms or are unable to independently develop non-infringing competitive alternatives.\nAlthough there are currently no known pending or threatened proceedings or claims that are material relating to alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the future in which third parties allege that their patents or other intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by us or our products or processes. In the event that any such infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others is found, we may need to obtain licenses from those parties or substantially re-engineer our products or processes to avoid such infringement, misappropriation or violation. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or be able to re-engineer our products or processes successfully. Moreover, if we are found by a court of law to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from making, using or selling the infringing products or technology. We also could be enjoined from making, using or selling the allegedly infringing products or technology pending the final outcome of the suit. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if competitors were to develop similar intellectual property independently, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, know-how or trade secrets could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share.\nIn addition, we may be unable to determine when third parties are using our intellectual property rights without our authorization. We also have licensed certain of our intellectual property rights to third parties, and we cannot be certain that our licensees are using our intellectual property only as authorized by the applicable license agreement. The undetected or unremedied unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or the legitimate development or acquisition of intellectual property related to our industry by third parties could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have as a result of our intellectual property, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intangible assets or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant noncash charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets and other long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we review our intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in share price and market capitalization, changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nFailure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could result in misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance. We have determined that such attacks could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to at least certain confidential business information. However, to date, we have not experienced any material financial impact, changes in the competitive environment or business operations that we attribute to these attacks. Although management does not believe that we have experienced any material losses to date related to security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. We actively manage the risks within our control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms.\nOur TiO2 and Alkali businesses are capital intensive, and our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to develop and market innovative products and to update our facilities and process technology. We may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing research and development activities and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of, and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects, and the status and timing of these developments, as well as general availability of capital from debt and/or equity markets. Additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. Further, the terms of our debt may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could harm our business.\nIndex", "PERMNO": 91153, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TROX"}
