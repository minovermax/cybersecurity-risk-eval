{"cik": "1500435", "company": "GoPro, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if any of the following risks, or other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial, actually occur. In that event, the trading price of our shares may decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe depend on sales of our capture devices for substantially all of our revenue, and any decrease in the sales of these products would harm our business.\nWe expect to continue to derive the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of cameras, mounts and accessories for the foreseeable future. A decline in the price or unit demand for these products, whether due to macroeconomic conditions, competition or otherwise, or our inability to increase sales of these products, would harm our business and operating results more seriously than it would if we derived significant revenue from a variety of product lines and services.\nFor example, although our annual revenue in 2015 of $1,620.0 million was up 16% from 2014, our fourth quarter revenue of $436.6 million was down 31% year-over-year. Fourth quarter 2015 revenue reflected global sell-through at retailers that was seasonally weaker than the prior year and the lack of a major new product launch in the fourth quarter of 2015. Demand for our new HERO4 Session was less than expected, and our revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by price reductions and corresponding price protection related charges of approximately $40 million. We believed these price reductions were needed to stimulate sell-through for this product. Additionally, we announced an end-of-life for our entry-level HERO line of capture devices in order to simplify our product offerings. As a result, we recorded product realignment charges of approximately $57 million to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015. In future periods, we could again experience a decline in revenue, or revenue could grow more slowly than we expect, which could have a material negative effect on our future gross margins and operating results. Specifically, we anticipate our revenue to decline by over 50% in the first quarter of 2016 on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we anticipate our full year 2016 revenue to decline as compared to 2015. If sales of our capture devices continue to decline in future periods, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows will be materially affected.\nChanges in product mix may harm our financial results. If there is a shift in consumer demand from our higher-priced to lower-priced capture devices in any or all of our market segments without a significant increase in units sold, our revenues and gross profit would decrease. For example, in 2015, the average selling price of units shipped decreased due to a higher mix of our lower-priced cameras, including the price reduced HERO4 Session and entry-level HERO cameras, which adversely impacted our revenue and gross profit.\nWhile we are pursuing additional products and services to add to our offerings, as described in the risk factors that follow, we may not be successful in identifying or executing on such opportunities. For example, the consumer drone market remains relatively new and the launch of our drone product may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. In addition, we do not have significant experience deriving revenue from the distribution of GoPro content, and we cannot be assured that our investments in the development of software and entertainment related initiatives will result in increased revenue. Also, pursuing these new markets requires substantial operating expense investment and even if we do generate significant incremental revenue, we may not be able to do so profitably.\nAs a result, our future growth and financial performance may depend heavily on our ability to develop and sell enhanced versions of our capture devices. If we fail to deliver product enhancements, new releases or new products that appeal to consumers, our future financial condition, operating results and cash flows will be materially affected.\nOur growth depends in part on further penetrating our total addressable market, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nOur growth historically has largely been fueled by the adoption of our products by people looking to self-capture images of themselves participating in exciting physical activities. We believe that our future growth depends not only on continuing to reach and expand this core demographic, but also broadening our user base to include a more diverse group of consumers seeking to capture their daily lives. We believe that in order to expand our market, we\nmust provide both innovative and easy-to-use capture devices as well as intuitive and simple software tools in the future that enable the seamless sharing of content, and we may not be able to do this on a timely basis and we may not be successful in providing tools that are easy to use. Our growth also depends on expanding the market with new capture perspectives, including spherical and aerial. While we are investing resources, including in sales and marketing, to reach these expanded and new consumer markets, we cannot be assured that we will be successful in doing so. If we are not successful in penetrating additional markets, we might not be able to grow our revenue and we may not recognize benefits from our investment in new areas.\nTo remain competitive and stimulate consumer demand, we must manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\nWe believe that we must continually develop and introduce new products, enhance our existing products and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products to maintain or increase our revenue.\nThe success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful research and development, pricing, market and consumer acceptance, the effective forecasting and management of product demand, purchase commitments and inventory levels, the management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. In addition, the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or reduce demand for our current products, thereby offsetting any benefits of successful product introductions and potentially lead to challenges in managing inventory of existing products. Failure to complete product transitions effectively or in a timely manner could harm our brand and lead to, among other things, lower revenue and excess inventory.\nFor example, demand for our new HERO4 Session was less than expected and our revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by price reductions and corresponding price protection related charges of approximately $40 million. We believed these price reductions were needed to stimulate sell-through for this product. Additionally, we announced the end-of-life for our entry-level HERO line of capture devices in order to simplify our product offering. As a result, we recorded product realignment charges of approximately $57 million to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015. If we fail to effectively manage new product introductions and transitions in the future, including our next generation capture devices, drones and content-management software solutions, our revenue and profitability will be materially affected.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop desirable products, we might not be able to maintain or increase our revenue and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to introduce appealing new products or novel technologies in a timely manner, or our new products or technologies are not accepted by consumers, our competitors may increase their market share, which could hurt our competitive position.\nOur research and development efforts are complex and require us to incur substantial expenses to support the development of our next generation capture devices, drones, content-management software solutions, and other new products and services. Our research and development expense was $241.7 million, $151.9 million and $73.7 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in 2016. Unanticipated problems in developing products could also divert substantial resources, which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements of existing products, and could further increase our costs. We may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts, and our business may be adversely effected.\nAs we continually seek to enhance our products, we will incur additional costs to incorporate new or revised features. We might not be able to, or determine that it is not in our interests to, raise prices to compensate for these additional costs.\nOur expected entrance into the consumer drone market is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nWe plan to launch our first drone for recreational use in 2016. We have no experience in the consumer drone market and expect to face significant competition from other companies promoting their own drone and related products.\nThese include established and start up drone manufacturers, such as DJI Technology Co., Parrot SA, Yuneec and 3DR, who currently have or are attempting to gain a substantial share of the emerging international drone market. Failure to timely launch a cost effective drone and/or failure to effectively compete in this new market could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results.\nRegulations and legislation relating to the use of consumer drones in the United States and other countries where we plan to sell our drones are evolving and may be subject to future changes that could negatively impact our sales of such products. Effective December 21, 2015, U.S. consumers who own a drone over a certain weight threshold must register with the Federal Aviation Administration's registry before they fly outdoors. It is possible that further regulations in the United States or other countries could restrict the use of recreational drones and/or require specific certification, qualifications or design modifications, which could have an unfavorable impact on our future business, financial position and operating results.\nIn addition, our drones and related product offerings present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users experience failures or other quality issues. If our drones malfunction or contain errors or defects, collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenue and profitability.\nThe market for capture devices, including cameras and camcorders, is highly competitive. Further, we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors introduce new and more competitive offerings alongside their existing products, and as market entrants introduce new products into our markets. Our products are discretionary items for consumers subject to changing preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased competition and changing consumer preferences may result in pricing pressures and reduced profit margins and may impede our ability to continue to increase the sales of our products or cause us to lose market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Canon Inc., Fujifilm Corporation, Nikon Corporation, Olympus Corporation, Rollei GmbH & Co. KG and Vivitar Corporation, as well as large, diversified electronics companies such as, Panasonic Corporation, Polaroid Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Corporation and VTech Technologies, and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd.\nMany of our current competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do. In addition, many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories; the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products; broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners; access to larger established customer bases; greater resources to make acquisitions; larger intellectual property portfolios; and the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services.\nMoreover, smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional camera sales. It is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of these devices, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung, may design them for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments, or develop products with features similar to ours. In addition to competition or potential competition from large, established companies, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products. Further, we are aware that certain companies have developed cameras designed and packaged to appear similar to our products, which may confuse consumers or distract consumers from purchasing GoPro products.\nAdditionally, we expect to enter the consumer drone market in 2016 and face significant competition from other companies promoting their own drone and related products. These include established and start up drone manufacturers, such as DJI Technology Co., Parrot SA, Yuneec and 3DR, who currently have or are attempting to gain a substantial share of the emerging international drone market. Failure to effectively compete in this new market could negatively affect our operating results and financial position.\nWe do not expect to continue to grow in the future at the same rate as we have in the past and profitability in recent periods might not be indicative of future performance.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, our annual revenue grew rapidly from $986 million to $1,620 million, which represents a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 45%. As our revenue has increased, our annual growth rate has slowed, and our historical growth should not be considered as indicative of our future performance. Although our annual revenue in 2015 was up 16% compared to 2014, our fourth quarter revenue declined 31% on a year-over-year basis. In future periods, we could again experience a decline in revenue, or revenue could grow more slowly than we expect, which could have a material negative effect on our future operating results. Specifically, we anticipate our first quarter and full year 2016 revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis. Lower levels of revenue and higher levels of operating expense investment may result in limited profitability or losses. For example, we expect to record a substantial net loss in the first quarter of 2016, as compared to the net income we recorded in the first quarter of 2015.\nWe may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors.\nIf our sales fall below our forecasts, especially during the holiday season, our overall financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. We have traditionally experienced greater revenues in the fourth quarter of each year due to demand related to the holiday season, and in some years, the launch of new products heading into the holiday season. Fourth quarter revenue comprised 27%, 45% and 37% of our 2015, 2014 and 2013 revenue, respectively. Given the strong seasonal nature of our sales, appropriate forecasting is critical to our operations. We anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales is likely to continue and any shortfalls in expected fourth quarter net sales, due to macroeconomic conditions, product release patterns, a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, supply chain disruptions, or for any other reason, could cause our annual results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015, our revenue declined on a year-over-year basis, which had a material negative impact on our annual operating results for 2015. In addition, we typically experience lower revenue in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 our revenue declined sequentially by 43% and 35%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect our seasonal decline in revenue to be greater than what we have experienced historically. Specifically, we anticipate our revenue to decline by over 50% in the first quarter of 2016 on a year-over-year basis.\nIn contrast, a substantial portion of our expenses are personnel related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and incentive-based compensation plan expenses, which are not seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate a negative impact on operating margins in the short term. To the extent such revenue shortfalls recur in future periods, our operating results would be harmed. For example, we expect to record a substantial net loss in the first quarter of 2016 due to lower levels of revenue and higher levels of operating expense investment.\nAn economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key U.S. and international markets may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products.\nOur products are discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, and other factors such as consumer confidence, the availability and cost of consumer credit, levels of unemployment and tax rates. For example, while much of our revenue is derived from markets outside the U.S., the substantial majority of our sales occur in U.S. dollars and an increase in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies increases the real cost of our products to consumers in those local markets. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or if economic conditions further deteriorate, consumers may delay or reduce purchases of our products. Consumer demand for our products may not reach our sales targets, or may decline, when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face substantial risks related to inventory, purchase commitments and long-lived assets, and we could incur material charges related to these items that adversely affect our operating results.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply and meet the demands of our retailers and distributors, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our contract manufacturers and component suppliers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products as well as accurately track the level of product inventory in the channel to ensure we are not in an over or under supply situation. In addition, as we develop or introduce new products and services, our older products and services will reach the end of their respective lifecycles. To the extent we discontinue the manufacturing and sales of any products and services, we must manage the inventory liquidation, supplier commitments and customer expectations. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded product realignment charges of $57 million to cost of revenue for excess purchase order commitments, excess inventory, and obsolete tooling, relating to the end-of-life of our entry-level HERO products and slower than anticipated overall demand.\nNo assurance can be given that we will not incur additional charges in future periods related to our inventory management or that we will not underestimate or overestimate forecast sales in a future period. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products is affected by many factors, including product introductions by us and our competitors, channel inventory levels, unanticipated changes in general market demand, macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence. If we do not accurately forecast customer demand for our products, we may in future periods be unable to meet customer, retailer or distributor demand for our products, or may be required to incur higher costs to secure the necessary production capacity and components, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our expansion effectively, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe have experienced rapid growth over the last several years which has placed a strain on our operations. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 45% of our employees had been with us for less than one year and approximately 68% for less than two years. Additionally, because of our growth, we have significantly expanded our operating lease commitments. At December 31, 2015, our future non-cancelable operating lease commitments through 2027 were $152.2 million. If our business and headcount do not grow resulting in excess leased facility capacity and we are unable to sublease our facilities, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our expansion effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures, and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems. These additional investments have increased our operating costs, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. Moreover, if we fail to scale our operations or manage our growth successfully, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in response to unfavorable market conditions or consumer demand, we may be required to strategically realign our resources, adjust our product line and/or enact price reductions in order to stimulate demand, and implement workforce reductions. Any such actions may result in the recording of special charges including, inventory-related write-offs, workforce reductions, or other restructuring costs. Additionally, our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our assets, including purchased intangible assets and tooling, could also change and result in impairment charges.\nFor example, in January 2016, we adopted a restructuring plan that provided for a 7% reduction in our global workforce. The implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business, and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount reduction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have completed several acquisitions, and we expect to evaluate additional acquisitions of, or strategic investments in other companies, products or technologies that we believe are complementary to our business. For example, in February 2016, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire two mobile video editing application companies for cash consideration of approximately $105 million to further enhance our future software offerings.\nWe may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users or investors. In addition, if we fail to integrate successfully such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from their primary responsibilities, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, and consequently, we may be required to take impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. In addition, our future operating results may be impacted by performance earnouts or contingent payments. Furthermore, acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expense and the recording and subsequent amortization or impairments of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets, any of which could negatively impact our future results of operations. We may also record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment charges in the future. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected revenue, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.\nOur success depends on the value and reputation of our brand, including our primary trademarks \u201cGOPRO\u201d and \u201cHERO\u201d, as well as the GoPro logo and the GoPro \"Be a Hero\" logo. The GoPro brand is integral to the growth of our business and expansion into new vertical markets. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will largely depend on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high quality products, and our consumers' satisfaction with the technical support and software updates we provide. Failure to grow and maintain our brand or negative publicity related to our products, our consumers\u2019 user-generated content, the athletes we sponsor, the celebrities we are associated with, or the labor policies of any of our suppliers or manufacturers could adversely impact our brand, business and operating results. Maintaining and enhancing our\nbrand will also require us to make substantial investments, although there is no guarantee that these investments will increase sales of our products or positively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide components for our products.\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our cameras and accessories are sourced from third-party suppliers, and some of these components are provided by a single supplier or by a supplier that could potentially become a competitor.\nIf we lose access to components from a particular supplier, or experience a significant disruption in the supply of products and components from a current supplier, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand for our products, our suppliers might not have the capacity or elect to meet our needs as they allocate components to other customers. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the supplier\u2019s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices, and if we seek to source materials from new suppliers there can be no assurance that we could do so in a manner that does not disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Our reliance on single source, or a small number of, suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to: supplier capacity constraints; price increases; timely delivery; component quality; failure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions; delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies; and natural disasters, fire, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events.\nIn particular, we incorporate video compression and image processing semiconductors from one provider, Ambarella, Inc., into all of our cameras, and we do not currently have an alternative supplier for these key components. If Ambarella stopped supplying components on acceptable terms, or at all, or we experienced delays in receipt of components from Ambarella, we would experience a significant disruption in our ability to produce our products, and our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nAny significant disruption of our information systems, and our reliance on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technologies from third parties, could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information systems to operate our e-commerce website, process transactions, respond to consumer inquiries, manage our supply chain and inventory, ship goods on a timely basis, maintain cost-efficient operations, and complete timely and accurate financial reporting.\nOur information systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. We have implemented certain systems and processes to restrict unauthorized access and protect our data and systems. To date, unauthorized users have not had a material impact on our systems; however, there can be no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems, system failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes, could affect our financial systems and operations, and could cause delays in our supply chain or cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during our seasonally strong fourth quarter. Any of these events could reduce demand for our products, impair our ability to complete sales through our e-commerce channels and cause our revenue to decline. If changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers or our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn particular, we are heavily reliant on SaaS enterprise resource planning systems to conduct our order and inventory management, e-commerce and financial transactions and reporting. In addition, we utilize third-party cloud computing services in connection with our business operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party hosting/cloud computing providers, or content delivery network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact our business and operating results, our ability to accurately report our\nfinancial results, as well as the experience of our consumers, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs we expand our operations, we expect to utilize additional systems and service providers that may also be essential to managing our business. Although the systems and services that we require are typically available from a number of providers, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement these relationships. Therefore, our ability to manage our business would suffer if one or more of our providers suffer an interruption in their business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in their operations, or we have to change or add systems and services. We may not be able to control the quality of the systems and services we receive from third-party service providers, which could impair our ability to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting and complete timely and accurate financial reporting, and may impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to adequately protect business and consumer data could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.\nChanging regulations and laws governing the Internet, data privacy, data protection and e-commerce transactions (including taxation, pricing and electronic communications) could impede the growth of our e-commerce business, increase our cost of doing business and limit our ability to collect and use information collected from our users. Further, new regulations limiting our ability to collect, use and disclose consumer data, or imposing additional requirements with respect to the retention and security of consumer data, could limit our marketing activities and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn our e-commerce services, we process, store and transmit consumer data. We also collect user data through certain marketing activities. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors\u2019 technology and systems, could expose us or our customers and consumers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business. Further, we are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce and electronic devices. Existing and future laws and regulations, or new interpretations of these laws, may adversely affect our ability to conduct our e-commerce business.\nWe depend on key personnel to grow and operate our business. If we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our CEO and our executive officers, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced research and development, sales and marketing and other personnel in the United States and abroad.\nAll of our employees, including our executive officers, are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry may be difficult to replace. We recently announced the resignation of our Chief Financial Officer, and while he will be replaced by our existing Vice President of Finance, this change in our executive management team could be disruptive to our operations. In addition, our Senior Vice President of GoPro Entertainment recently resigned from his employment position with us and was appointed to our board of directors. While he has been replaced by a new Vice President of GoPro Entertainment to assume his responsibilities, this change in leadership could be disruptive to our business.\nIf more of our executive officers or other key employees leave, we may not be able to fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and our operations could suffer. Furthermore, in the case of Nick Woodman, our founder and CEO, his departure could affect our ability to continue to attract other top executives and potentially negatively impact the view of our brand. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. While we utilize competitive salary, bonus and long-term incentive packages to recruit new executives, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel also have greater resources than we do. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located. Fluctuations in the price of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. If we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively maintain and further develop our sales channels, including developing and supporting our retail sales channel and distributors, our business could be harmed.\nAs a consumer-facing company, we depend upon effective sales channels to reach the consumers who are the ultimate purchasers of our products. In the United States, we primarily sell our products directly through a mix of retail channels, including big box, mid-market and specialty retailers, and we reach certain U.S. markets through distributors. In international markets, we primarily sell through distributors who in turn sell to local retailers; however we also retain some direct sales relationships with certain customers. We depend on retailers to provide adequate and attractive space for our products and POP displays in their stores. We further depend on our retailers to employ, educate and motivate their sales personnel to effectively sell our products. If our retailers do not adequately display our products, choose to promote competitors\u2019 products over ours or do not effectively explain to customers the advantages of our products, our sales could decrease and our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be adversely affected if any of our large retail customers were to experience financial difficulties, or change the focus of their businesses in a way that deemphasized the sale of our products. We also continue to invest heavily in providing new retailers with POP displays and expanding the footprint of our POP displays in existing stores, and there can be no assurance that this investment will lead to increased sales\nWe currently depend on our distributors to reach certain market segments in the United States and to reach many of our international retailers. Our distributors generally offer products from several different manufacturers. Accordingly, we are at risk that these distributors may give higher priority to selling other companies\u2019 products. We have consolidated our distributor channels in certain regions, and if we were to lose the services of a distributor, we might need to find another distributor in that area and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so in a timely manner or on favorable terms. Further, our distributors build inventory in anticipation of future sales, and if such sales do not occur as rapidly as they anticipate, our distributors will decrease the size of their future product orders. We are also subject to the risks of our distributors encountering financial difficulties, which could impede their effectiveness and also expose us to financial risk if they are unable to pay for the products they purchase from us. Additionally, our international distributors buy from us in U.S. dollars and generally sell to retailers in local currency so significant currency fluctuations could impact their profitability, and in turn, affect their ability to buy future products from us.\nWe have converted portions of our distributors' business into direct sales, and if we were to do this on a larger scale, it could create significant disruptions to our distribution channel and the associated revenue. Any reduction in sales by our current distributors, loss of key distributors or decrease in revenue from our distributors could adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nA small number of retailers and distributors account for a substantial portion of our revenue, and if our relationships with any of these retailers or distributors were to be terminated or the level of business with them significantly reduced, our business could be harmed.\nOur ten largest customers, measured by the revenue we derive from them, accounted for 52%, 50% and 51% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. One retailer accounted for 14%, 20% and 17% of our revenue for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A second retailer accounted for 12% of our revenue in 2015. The loss of a small number of our large customers, or the reduction in business with one or more of these customers, could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. While we have agreements with these large customers, these agreements do not require them to purchase any meaningful amount of our products annually.\nIf we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market and to meet customer expectations could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party distribution facilities for substantially all of our product distribution to distributors and directly to retailers. Our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means their operations may be vulnerable to computer viruses or other security risks, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. Further, because substantially all of our products are distributed from only a few locations and by a small number of companies, our operations could be interrupted by labor difficulties, extreme or severe weather conditions, or floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution centers, or port shutdowns or other transportation-related interruptions along our distribution routes. Additionally, we use one primary supplier for the third party distribution and if this supplier were to incur financial difficulties, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur international business operations account for a significant portion of our revenue and are subject to challenges and risks.\nRevenue from outside the United States comprised 52%, 43% and 49% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and we expect this portion to continue to be significant in the future. Further, our supply chain partners have operations in countries including China, Brazil, Singapore, Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. We intend to expand our relationships in these countries and may establish additional relationships in other countries as we continue to expand our international operations. Operating in foreign countries requires significant resources and considerable management attention, and we may enter new geographic markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. International expansion has required and will continue to require us to invest significant funds and other resources and we cannot be assured our efforts will be successful. International sales and operations may be subject to risks such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations including product labeling;\n\u2022\nadverse tax effects and foreign exchange controls making it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;\n\u2022\nthe impact of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nterrorist activities and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\ndiffering employment practices and laws and labor disruptions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of government controls;\n\u2022\nlesser degrees of intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\ntariffs and customs duties and the classifications of our goods by applicable governmental bodies;\n\u2022\na legal system subject to undue influence or corruption; and\n\u2022\na business culture in which illegal sales practices may be prevalent.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our international business and consequently our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns from retailers than expected, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe generally provide a 12-month warranty on all of our products, except in the European Union, or EU, where we provide a two-year warranty on all of our products. Additionally, we anticipate introducing our drone product in 2016 and we have no historical experience related to warranty claims for this product. The occurrence of any material defects in our products could make us liable for damages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves. In addition, we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims or other problems, including costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality and safety of our products could affect our brand image, decrease retailer, distributor and consumer demand, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Also, while our warranty is limited to repairs and returns, warranty claims may result in litigation, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nConsumers may be injured while engaging in activities with our products, and we may be exposed to claims, or regulations could be imposed, which could adversely affect our brand, operating results and financial condition.\nConsumers use our capture devices, and we anticipate in 2016 our drones, to self-capture their participation in a wide variety of physical activities, including extreme sports, which in many cases carry the risk of significant injury. Consumers may also use our drones for a wide range of flight activity, including aerial data collection, videography,\nand photography. We may be subject to claims that users have been injured or harmed by or while using our products, including false claims or erroneous reports relating to safety, security or privacy issues, or that personal property has been damaged as a result of use of our drone. Although we maintain insurance to help protect us from the risk of such claims, such insurance may not be sufficient or may not apply to all situations. Similarly, proprietors of establishments at which consumers engage in challenging physical activities could seek to ban the use of our products in their facilities to limit their own liability. In addition, if lawmakers or governmental agencies were to determine that the use of our products increased the risk of injury to all or a subset of our users, they may pass laws or adopt regulations that limit the use of our products or increase our liability associated with the use of our products. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand, operating results and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products, and our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology, products, or another aspect of our business infringes third party intellectual property or if third parties infringe our rights.\nWe own patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (collectively \u201cintellectual property\u201d) related to aspects of our products, software, services, and designs. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain these rights in the United States and abroad.\nWe regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design as we deem appropriate. We may fail to apply for patents on important products, services, technologies or designs in a timely fashion, or at all. We may not have intellectual property rights in all countries where unauthorized third party copying or use of our technology occurs and the scope of our intellectual property might be more limited in some countries. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficient to protect our products, services, technologies, or designs and/or may not prevent others from developing competing products, services, technologies, or designs. As a result, we cannot predict the validity and enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property with certainty.\nWe have registered, and applied to register, certain of our trademarks in several jurisdictions worldwide. In some of those jurisdictions, other filings exist for the same, similar or otherwise related products or services, which could block the registration of our marks. Even if we are able to register our marks, competitors may adopt or file similar marks to ours, register domain names that mimic or incorporate our marks, or otherwise infringe upon our trademark rights. Although we police our trademark rights carefully, there can be no assurance that we are aware of or that we will prevail in all such instances. Any of these negative outcomes could impact the strength, value and effectiveness of our brand, as well as our ability to market our products.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Initiating infringement proceedings against third parties can be expensive, take significant time, and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. We may not prevail in litigation to enforce our intellectual property against unauthorized use.\nThird parties have brought intellectual property infringement claims against us. We expect to continue to receive such intellectual property claims in the future and will defend the Company vigorously against any such existing and future legal proceedings. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. For example, patent holding companies and practicing entities, including our competitors, have alleged infringement of patent or other intellectual property infringement. We may not prevail against such allegations. We may seek licenses from third parties where appropriate, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. An adverse ruling in an intellectual property infringement proceedings could force us to suspend or permanently cease the production or sale of products/services, face a temporary or permanent injunction, redesign our products/services, rebrand our products/services, pay significant settlement costs, pay third party license fees or damage awards, or give up our intellectual property.\nIf we encounter issues with our manufacturers or suppliers, our business, brand, and results of operations could be harmed and we could lose sales.\nWe do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and for 2015 relied on various contract manufacturers, including Chicony Electronics Co. Ltd., Jabil Circuit Limited, and Sky Light Digital Limited/Sky Light Industrial Limited to manufacture our products. We cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience disruptions in their manufacturing\noperations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, component or material shortages, cost increases or other similar problems. Further, in order to minimize their inventory risk, our manufacturers might not order components from third-party suppliers with adequate lead time, thereby impacting our ability to meet our demand forecast. Therefore, if we fail to manage our relationship with our manufacturers effectively, or if they experience operational difficulties, our ability to ship products to our retailers and distributors could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed.\nIn the event that we receive shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards, and we are not able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk revenue losses from the inability to sell those products, increased administrative and shipping costs, and lower profitability. Additionally, if defects are not discovered until after consumers purchase our products, they could lose confidence in the technical attributes of our products and our business could be harmed.\nWe do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers, including their labor, environmental or other practices. We require our contract manufacturers and suppliers to comply with our formal supplier code of conduct and relevant standards and have ongoing audit programs in place to assess our suppliers' compliance with our requirements. We periodically conduct audits of our contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 compliance with our code of conduct, applicable laws and good industry practices. However, these audits may not be frequent or thorough enough to detect non-compliance. Deliberate violations of labor, environmental or other laws by our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or a failure of these parties to follow ethical business practices, could lead to negative publicity and harm our reputation or brand.\nWe continue to invest in the further development of a content management platform and the acquisition and distribution of content for GoPro Entertainment, and we might not be successful in doing so.\nWe believe that enabling consumers to easily capture, manage, share and enjoy their GoPro content will increase consumer interest in our products, and we continue to invest in improving our software offerings and the further development of our content management platform to assist consumers with these tasks. The development of these software offerings and other tools needed for these purposes requires different skills from our historical core focus of developing capture devices.\nWe also continue to invest to scale GoPro Entertainment and develop new revenue opportunities by increasing production of GoPro originally produced content while simultaneously increasing the aggregation and redistribution of our consumers\u2019 \u201cbest of\u201d UGC and developing the GoPro content management platform. Additionally, we are investing to develop and distribute the GoPro Channel on more partner platforms. We do not have significant experience deriving revenue from the distribution of GoPro content and the execution of this business strategy requires different skills from our historical core focus of developing capture devices.\nTo achieve our goals, we have continued to hire key personnel who we believe have the requisite skills and experience to manage and execute on these plans. We cannot be assured of our ability to organize, manage and execute these relatively new functions within our business. If we are not successful, we may not achieve our goals of facilitating greater consumer use of their content and scaling GoPro Entertainment, and we might not recover the investments we make in these efforts, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain or acquire rights to include intellectual property owned by others in the content distributed by us, our marketing, sales or future business strategy could be affected or we could be subject to lawsuits relating to our use of this content.\nThe distribution of GoPro content helps to market our brand and our products. If we cannot continue to acquire rights to distribute UGC or acquire rights to use and distribute music, athlete and celebrity names and likenesses or other content for our original productions or our entertainment distribution channels or for our software products, our marketing efforts could be diminished, our sales could be harmed and our future content strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, third-party content providers may allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use of or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims of infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected. As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute. If we are found to be liable for infringement, then our business may suffer.\nFailure to obtain new, and maintain existing, high-quality event, venue, athlete and celebrity sponsorships could harm our business.\nEstablishing relationships with high profile sporting and entertainment events, venues, sports leagues and sports associations, athletes and celebrity personalities to evaluate, promote and establish product credibility with consumers, including entering into sponsorship and licensing agreements, has and will continue to be a key element of our marketing strategy. However, as competition in our markets has increased, the costs of obtaining and retaining event, venue, athlete and celebrity sponsorships and licensing agreements have increased. Additionally, we may be forced to sign longer term sponsorships in order to retain relationships. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with our event, venue, athlete and celebrity partners, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the benefits of these relationships, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. In addition, actions taken by endorsers of our products that harm their reputations could also harm our brand image with consumers. The failure to correctly identify high impact events and venues or build partnerships with those who develop and promote those events and venues, promising athletes or other appealing personalities to use and endorse our products, or poor performance by our endorsers, could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe global nature of our business and the significance of our international revenue create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to another, or securing an advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in areas of the world that experience corruption by government officials to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery and anticorruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our global operations require us to import and export to and from several countries, which geographically expands our compliance obligations. In addition, changes in such laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be assured that our employees or other agents will not engage in prohibited conduct and render us responsible under the FCPA or the U.K. Bribery Act. If we are found to be in violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-bribery or anticorruption laws (either due to acts or inadvertence of our employees, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe U.S. and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies. Our products are subject to U.S. export controls, and exports of our products must be made in compliance with various economic and trade sanctions laws. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions, our products, including our firmware updates, could be provided to those targets or provided by our customers despite such precautions. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.\nIn 2014, we determined that we may have shipped some products to international customers that, prior to shipment, may have required either a one-time product review or application for an encryption registration number in lieu of such product review. We also determined that we provided controlled technology to our offshore manufacturing partners without the required export licenses. We subsequently acquired the appropriate encryption number and obtained an export license for the export of controlled technology to our offshore manufacturing partners. Additionally, in 2014, we discovered our failure to file an annual self-classification report and comply with record keeping requirements of the Export Administration Regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security and believe that we have now become compliant with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements. We also identified possible firmware downloads for cameras to persons in embargoed countries. We self-reported these potential violations to the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security and also submitted a related supplemental disclosure and have taken, and continue to take, remedial measures to prevent similar export control violations from occurring in the future. In October 2015, the Department of Commerce notified us that it had completed its investigation of the potential export violations we had reported and issued a cautionary letter, without imposing any penalties or restrictions.\nIn 2014, we also discovered potential sanctions violations involving transactions with sanctioned parties, the provision of support services to persons in an embargoed country, and firmware updates to persons in several embargoed countries. We have self-reported these potential violations to the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and have also submitted a related supplemental disclosure and have taken and continue to take remedial measures to prevent similar export control violations from occurring in the future. In February 2015, the Treasury Department notified us that it had completed its review of the transactions we had reported and issued a cautionary letter, without imposing any penalties or restrictions.\nWe could be subject to future enforcement action with respect to compliance with governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on export privileges that could have a material effect on our business and operating results.\nOur effective tax rate and the intended tax benefits of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business.\nThe application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on operating our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methods for valuing technology, intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or our current or historical tax positions, including with respect to research and development tax credits. Any such challenge could be costly and time consuming to defend and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate, and consequently adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur corporate structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. Our intercompany arrangements result in income earned by such entities in accordance with arm\u2019s-length principles and commensurate with functions performed, risks assumed and ownership of valuable corporate assets. We believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the U.S. statutory rate will have a long-term beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm\u2019s-length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In particular, there is uncertainty in relation to the U.S. tax legislation in terms of the future corporate tax rate but also in terms of the U.S. tax consequences of income derived from intellectual property held in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe complies with current tax laws. However, our tax liabilities may be adversely affected if such structure and arrangements are challenged by a taxing authority or we are unable to appropriately adapt the manner in which we operate our business or if the United States or other jurisdictions in which we do business change their tax laws in a manner that adversely impacts our tax liabilities.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls in the future, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, which could adversely impact our investors\u2019 confidence and our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, making some activities more time consuming and costly, placing significant demands on our financial and operational resources, as well as our IT systems.\nWhile we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015, we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. Our control environment may not be sufficient to remediate or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies from occurring. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and all instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we identify future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nWe use open source software in our platform that may subject our technology to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may cause harm to our business.\nWe use open source software in connection with our services. From time to time, companies that incorporate open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute or make available open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could nevertheless occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nAny significant disruption to our e-commerce business could result in lost sales.\nOnline sales through gopro.com are subject to a number of risks. System interruptions or delays could cause potential consumers to fail to purchase our products and could harm our reputation and brand. The operation of our direct to consumer e-commerce business through gopro.com depends on the ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of online order-taking and fulfillment operations. Our e-commerce operations subject us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our operating results, including risks related to the computer systems that operate our website and related support systems, such as system failures, viruses, computer hackers and similar\ndisruptions. If we or our designated third party contractors are unable to maintain and upgrade our e-commerce website or if we encounter system interruptions or delays, our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, stock-based compensation expense, warranty reserves, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, and accounting for income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. Examples of these laws and regulations include the EU Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive, or the RoHS Directive, and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or the WEEE Directive, as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, South Korea, Norway and Japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\nThe RoHS Directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. Although we have policies and procedures in place requiring our contract manufacturers and major component suppliers to comply with the RoHS Directive requirements, we cannot assure you that our manufacturers and suppliers consistently comply with these requirements. In addition, if there are changes to these or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to re-engineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.\nThe WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such products. Changes in interpretation of the directive may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows and, although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe SEC\u2019s conflict minerals rule has caused us to incur additional costs, could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain minerals used in manufacturing our products, and could make us less competitive in our target markets.\nThe SEC\u2019s conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of the origin, source and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires companies to obtain sourcing data from suppliers,\nengage in supply chain due diligence, and file annually with the SEC a specialized disclosure report on Form SD covering the prior calendar year. The rule could limit our ability to source at competitive prices and to secure sufficient quantities of certain minerals (or derivatives thereof) used in the manufacture of our products, specifically tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, as the number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. We have and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with the rule, such as costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in our products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. Furthermore, we may encounter challenges in satisfying those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products. We continue to investigate the presence of conflict materials within our supply chain.\nCatastrophic events or political instability could disrupt and cause harm to our business.\nOur headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, an area susceptible to earthquakes. A major earthquake or other natural disaster, fire, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event in California or elsewhere that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be harmed. Our key manufacturing, supply and distribution partners have global operations including in China, Singapore and the Netherlands as well as the United States. Political instability or catastrophic events in any of those countries could adversely affect our business in the future, our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nSince shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our IPO in July 2014 at a price of $24.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $16.89 to $98.47 through December 31, 2015. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results; changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections; the public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; significant transactions, or new features, products or services by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; media coverage of our business and financial performance; the operating and stock price performance of, or other developments involving, other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; trends in our industry; any significant change in our management; and general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. Volatility in our stock price also impacts the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been the target of this type of litigation and may continue to be a target in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. A sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization could lead to impairment charges.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and other directors and their affiliates.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock hold approximately 78% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2015 with Mr. Woodman, our CEO, holding approximately 77% of the outstanding voting power. Mr. Woodman is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of\ndirectors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the following:\n\u2022\nour board of directors is not currently classified, but at such time as all shares of our Class B common stock have been converted into shares of our Class A common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nso long as any shares of our Class B common stock are outstanding, special meetings of our stockholders may be called by the holders of 10% of the outstanding voting power of all then outstanding shares of stock, a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive office or our president,\n\u2022\nwhen no shares of our Class B common stock are outstanding, only the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nour stockholders may only take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nvacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\u2022\ndirectors may be removed from office with or without cause so long as our board of directors is not classified, and thereafter directors may be removed from office only for cause;\n\u2022\nour restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;\n\u2022\nour restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, by our board of directors without stockholder approval and which may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of our Class A and Class B common stock; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of our Class A common stock increases.", "PERMNO": 14694, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "GPRO"}
