You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment. In the opinion of management, the risks discussed below represent the material risks known to the company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition and operating results and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is at an early stage of development and we may not develop therapeutic products that can be commercialized.\nOur business is at an early stage of development. We do not have immune-oncology products in late stage clinical trials. We are still in the early stages of identifying and conducting research on potential therapeutic products. Our potential therapeutic products will require significant research and development and pre-clinical and clinical testing prior to regulatory approval in the United States and other countries. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals, enter clinical trials for any of our product candidates, or commercialize any products. Our product candidates may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting their safety, efficacy or cost effectiveness that could prevent or limit their use. Any product using any of our technology may fail to provide the intended therapeutic benefits or achieve therapeutic benefits equal to or better than the standard of treatment at the time of testing or production.\nWe have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may never generate revenue or achieve profitability.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported a net loss of $28.3 million and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $596 million. We have not generated any significant revenue to date and are not profitable, and have incurred losses in each year since our inception. We do not expect to generate any product sales or royalty revenues for at least four years. We expect to incur significant additional operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expand research and development and clinical trial efforts.\nOur ability to achieve long-term profitability is dependent upon obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully commercializing our products alone or with third parties. However, our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are successfully developed and produced and thereafter commercialized. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our products, and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain.\nWe have used a significant amount of cash since inception to finance the continued development and testing of our product candidates, and we expect to need substantial additional capital resources in order to develop our product candidates going forward and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval.\nWe may not be successful in generating and/or maintaining operating cash flow, and the timing of our capital expenditures and other expenditures may not result in cash sufficient to sustain our operations through the next 12 months. If financing is not sufficient and additional financing is not available or available only on terms that are detrimental to our long-term survival, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to function. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for capital needs in 2021 and beyond;\n\u25cf\nscientific and clinical progress in our research and development programs;\n\u25cf\nthe magnitude and scope of our research and development programs and our ability to establish, enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing;\n\u25cf\nour progress with pre-clinical development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims; and\n\u25cf\nthe number and type of product candidates that we pursue.\nAdditional financing through strategic collaborations, public or private equity or debt financings or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Additional equity financing could result in significant dilution to our stockholders, and any debt financings will likely involve covenants restricting our business activities. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, if we obtain additional funds through arrangements with collaborative partners, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize on our own.\nIf sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or product development initiatives, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or business prospects.\nResearch and Development Investment\nOur currently projected expenditures for 2021 include approximately $12 million to $15 million for research and development. The actual cost of our programs could differ significantly from our current projections if we change our planned development process. In the event that actual costs of our clinical program, or any of our other ongoing research activities, are significantly higher than our current estimates, we may be required to significantly modify our planned level of operations.\nThe successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain. It is difficult to reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any product candidate, due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs. Any failure to complete any stage of the development of products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and liquidity.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and have not yet remedied these weaknesses. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal control could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as a company. As defined in Regulation 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented, or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we determined that we had the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: (i) inadequate segregation of duties; (ii) risks of executive override; and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, guidelines.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not remediated these material weaknesses. The company intends to take measures to mitigate the issues identified and implement a functional system of internal controls over financial reporting. Such measures will include, but not be limited to hiring of additional employees in its finance and accounting department, although the timing of such hires is largely dependent on our securing additional financing to cover such costs; preparation of risk-control matrices to identify key risks and develop and document policies to mitigate those risks; and identification and documentation of standard operating procedures for key financial activities. The implementation of these initiatives may not fully address any material weakness or other deficiencies that we may have in our internal control over financial reporting.\nEven if we develop effective internal control over financial reporting, such controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with such policies or procedures may deteriorate, which could result in the discovery of additional material weaknesses and deficiencies. In any event, the process of determining whether our existing internal control over financial reporting is compliant with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, and sufficiently effective requires the investment of substantial time and resources, including by certain members of our senior management. As a result, this process may divert internal resources and take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of this process and whether we will need to implement remedial actions in order to establish effective controls over financial reporting. The determination of whether or not our internal controls are sufficient and any remedial actions required could result in us incurring additional costs that we did not anticipate, including the hiring of outside consultants. We may also fail to timely complete our evaluation, testing and any remediation required to comply with Section 404.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. While we could be a smaller reporting company for an indefinite amount of time, and thus relieved of the above-mentioned attestation requirement, an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that our management's assessment might not. Such undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nOur intellectual property may be compromised.\nPart of our value going forward depends on the intellectual property rights that we have been and are acquiring. There may have been many persons involved in the development of our intellectual property, and we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary rights from all of them. It is possible that in the future, third parties may challenge our intellectual property rights. We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights. In either event, we may lose the value of our intellectual property, and if so, our business prospects may suffer.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market and our business would be harmed.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our trade secret or other confidential information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding any competitive advantage we may derive from this information.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any issued patents we own or license or any applications that may issue as patents in the future, which may result in those patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from developing similar products that do not fall within the scope of our patents. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we hold or pursue is threatened, our ability to commercialize any product candidates with technology protected by those patents could be threatened. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we would have patent protection for any covered product candidates that obtain regulatory approval would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain at the time of filing that we are the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our discovery platform and drug development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents or not amenable to patent protection. Although we require all of our employees and certain consultants and advisors to assign inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be disclosed or competitors may otherwise gain access to such information or independently develop substantially equivalent information. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant difficulty in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the trade secret intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain the competitive advantage that we believe is provided by such intellectual property, which could materially adversely affect our market position and business and operational results.\nClaims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from those activities, may infringe or be accused of infringing a patent or other form of intellectual property under which we do not hold a license or other rights. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware, with claims that cover the use or manufacture of our product candidates or the practice of our related methods. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes one or more claims of these patents. If our activities or product candidates infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, the holders of such intellectual property rights may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidates or practice our methods unless we obtain a license under the intellectual property rights or until any applicable patents expire or are determined to be invalid or unenforceable.\nDefense of any intellectual property infringement claims against us, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a significant diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, limit our business to avoid the infringing activities, pay royalties and/or redesign our infringing product candidates or methods, any or all of which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Further, if we were to seek a license from the third party holder of any applicable intellectual property rights, we may not be able to obtain the applicable license rights when needed or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The occurrence of any of the above events could prevent us from continuing to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates and our business could materially suffer.\nWe may desire, or be forced, to seek additional licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, and such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates, in which case we would need to obtain a license from that third party or develop a different formulation of the product that does not infringe upon the applicable intellectual property, which may not be possible. Additionally, we may identify product candidates that we believe are promising and whose development and other intellectual property rights are held by third parties. In such a case, we may desire to seek a license to pursue the development of those product candidates. Any license that we may desire to obtain or that we may be forced to pursue may not be available when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to secure a license that we need or desire could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nThe patent protection covering some of our product candidates may be dependent on third parties, who may not effectively maintain that protection.\nWhile we expect that we will generally seek to gain the right to fully prosecute any patents covering product candidates we may in-license from third-party owners, there may be instances when platform technology patents that cover our product candidates remain controlled by our licensors. If any of our current or future licensing partners that retain the right to prosecute patents covering the product candidates we license from them fail to appropriately maintain that patent protection, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and selling competing products or practicing competing methods and our ability to generate revenue from any commercialization of the affected product candidates may suffer.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time- consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our current or potential licensors. To attempt to stop infringement or unauthorized use, we may need to enforce one or more of our patents, which can be expensive and time-consuming and distract management. If we pursue any litigation, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensor\u2019s is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the relevant technology on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. Further, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, which could reduce the likelihood of success of any infringement proceeding we pursue in any such jurisdiction. An adverse result in any infringement litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, which could limit our ability to exclude competitors from directly competing with us in the applicable jurisdictions.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. PTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to use it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nIf we are unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining patent protection for intellectual property in development, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe are seeking patent protection for some of our technology and product candidates. Patent prosecution is a challenging process and is not assured of success. If we are unable to secure patent protection for our technology and product candidates, our business may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, issued patents and pending international applications require regular maintenance. Failure to maintain our portfolio may result in loss of rights that may adversely impact our intellectual property rights, for example by rendering issued patents unenforceable or by prematurely terminating pending international applications.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know- how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We currently, and expect in the future to continue to, seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such disclosure. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time- consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they disclose the trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under our license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nOur business depends in part on licenses from third parties. These third-party license agreements impose obligations on us, such as payment obligations and obligations to diligently pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation, our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology platform could be severely adversely affected.\nWe will have to hire additional executive officers and employees to operate our business. If we are unable to hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nWe currently have only two fulltime employees. The loss of the services of any of our employees could delay our product development programs and our research and development efforts. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers, employees or consultants. In order to develop our business in accordance with our business strategy, we will have to hire additional qualified personnel, including in the areas of manufacturing, clinical trials management, regulatory affairs, finance, and business development. We will need to raise sufficient funds to hire the necessary employees and have commenced our search for additional key employees.\nMoreover, there is intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies against which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, longer histories in the industry and greater ability to provide valuable cash or stock incentives to potential recruits than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we are able to offer as an early- stage company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.\nWe depend on key personnel for our continued operations and future success, and a loss of certain key personnel could significantly hinder our ability to move forward with our business plan.\nBecause of the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified scientific and technical personnel for the research and development activities we conduct or sponsor. The loss of one or more key executive officers, or scientific officers, would be significantly detrimental to us. In addition, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work is critical to our success. Our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise, such as clinical testing, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and marketing, will require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our present and planned activities. Accordingly, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel, which would adversely affect the development of our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, with contractual provisions and other procedures, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact contributes to the development of intellectual property that we regard as our own. Further, the terms of such assignment agreements may be breached and we may not be able to successfully enforce their terms, which may force us to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of intellectual property rights we may regard and treat as our own.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with regulations of governmental authorities, such as the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to provide accurate information to the FDA or EMA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal, state and international healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations as they may become applicable to our operations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we currently take and the procedures we may establish in the future as our operations and employee base expand to detect and prevent this type of activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure by our employees to comply with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur reliance on the activities of our non-employee consultants, research institutions and scientific contractors, whose activities are not wholly within our control, may lead to delays in development of our proposed products.\nWe rely extensively upon and have relationships with scientific consultants at academic and other institutions, some of whom conduct research at our request, and other consultants with expertise in clinical development strategy or other matters. These consultants are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. We have limited control over the activities of these consultants and, except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements to the extent they exist, can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities. These research facilities may have commitments to other commercial and non-commercial entities. We have limited control over the operations of these laboratories and can expect only limited amounts of time to be dedicated to our research goals.\nIt may take longer to complete our clinical trials than we project, or we may not be able to complete them at all.\nFor budgeting and planning purposes, we have projected the date for the commencement, continuation and completion of our various clinical trials. However, a number of factors, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, and difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, may cause significant delays. We may not commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our products as projected or may not conduct them successfully.\nWe expect to rely on medical institutions, academic institutions or clinical research organizations to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our products. We will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own. If we fail to commence or complete, or experience delays in, any of our planned clinical trials, our stock price and our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could be harmed.\nClinical drug development is costly, time-consuming and uncertain, and we may suffer setbacks in our clinical development program that could harm our business.\nClinical drug development for our product candidates is costly, time-consuming and uncertain. Our product candidates are in various stages of development and while we expect that clinical trials for these product candidates will continue for several years, such trials may take significantly longer than expected to complete. In addition, we, the FDA, an institutional review board, or IRB, or other regulatory authorities, including state and local agencies and counterpart agencies in foreign countries, may suspend, delay, require modifications to or terminate our clinical trials at any time, for various reasons, including:\n\u25cf\ndiscovery of safety or tolerability concerns, such as serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects or exposure to otherwise unacceptable health risks, with respect to study participants;\n\u25cf\nlack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials or the failure of our product candidates to meet specified endpoints;\n\u25cf\ndelays in subject recruitment and enrollment in clinical trials or inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical ability to detect statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in retaining subjects and volunteers in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in obtaining IRB approval for studies to be conducted at each clinical trial site;\n\u25cf\ndelays in manufacturing or obtaining, or inability to manufacture or obtain, sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ninadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or the product formulation or method of delivery;\n\u25cf\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical trial sites and other third-party contractors;\n\u25cf\ninability to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty regarding proper formulation and dosing;\n\u25cf\nfailure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees or other third-party contractors to comply with contractual and applicable regulatory requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u25cf\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n\u25cf\nfailure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data; or\n\u25cf\nchanges in applicable laws, regulations and regulatory policies.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, those clinical trials could take longer than expected to complete and our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In particular, because we are focused on patients with molecularly defined cancers, our pool of suitable patients may be smaller and more selective and our ability to enroll a sufficient number of suitable patients may be limited or take longer than anticipated. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nPatient enrollment for any of our clinical trials may also be affected by other factors, including without limitation:\n\u25cf\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf\nthe frequency of the molecular alteration we are seeking to target in the applicable trial;\n\u25cf\nthe eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u25cf\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u25cf\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient cash to fund such increased costs when needed, which could result in the further delay or termination of the trial.\nConsistent with our general product development strategy, we intend to design future trials for our product candidates to include some patients with the applicable clinical characteristics, stage of therapy, molecular alterations, biomarkers, and/or cell surface antigens that determine therapeutic options, or are indicators of the disease, with a view to assessing possible early evidence of potential therapeutic effect. If we are unable to locate and include such patients in those trials, then our ability to make those early assessments and to seek participation in FDA expedited review and approval programs, including breakthrough therapy and fast track designation, or otherwise to seek to accelerate clinical development and regulatory timelines, could be compromised.\nWe have limited clinical testing and regulatory capabilities, and human clinical trials are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. Our products may fail to achieve necessary safety and efficacy endpoints during clinical trials, which may limit our ability to generate revenues from therapeutic products.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to invest or develop resources for clinical trials successfully or as expediently as necessary. In particular, human clinical trials can be very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be affected by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf\ndetermination of dosing issues;\n\u25cf\ninability to demonstrate effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u25cf\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u25cf\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we or the FDA, may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our investigational new drug application, or IND, submissions or the conduct of these trials.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time consuming and can subject us to unanticipated delays. even if we obtain regulatory approval for some of our products, those products may still face regulatory difficulties.\nAll of our potential products, processing and manufacturing activities, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. The process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals, including foreign approvals, is expensive and often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition, regulatory agencies may lack experience with our technologies and products, which may lengthen the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent their commercialization.\nIf we violate regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after we obtain marketing approval, the FDA may take enforcement action(s) against us, which could include issuing a warning or untitled letter, placing a clinical hold on an ongoing clinical trial, product seizure, enjoining our operations, refusal to consider our applications for pre-market approval, refusal of an investigational new drug application, fines, or even civil or criminal liability, any of which could materially harm our reputation and financial results. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our products. We may also be required to undertake post marketing trials to provide additional evidence of safety and effectiveness. In addition, if we or others identify side effects after any of our adoptive therapies are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulators may withdraw their approval and reformulations, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products, and additional marketing applications may be required.\nAny of the following factors, among others, could cause regulatory approval for our product candidates to be delayed, limited or denied:\n\u25cf\nthe product candidates require significant clinical testing to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before applications for marketing approval can be filed with the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\ndata obtained from pre-clinical and nonclinical animal testing and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways, and regulatory authorities may not agree with our respective interpretations or may require us to conduct additional testing;\n\u25cf\nnegative or inconclusive results or the occurrence of serious or unexpected adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate development efforts for a product candidate; and/or\n\u25cf\nFDA and other regulatory authorities may require expansion of the size and scope of the clinical trials.\nAny difficulties or failures that we encounter in securing regulatory approval for our product candidates would likely have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to generate product sales, and could make any search for a collaborative partner more difficult.\nObtaining regulatory approval even after clinical trials that are believed to be successful is an uncertain process.\nEven if we complete our planned clinical trials and believe the results were successful, obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the FDA or other regulatory agencies may delay, limit or deny approval of any of our applications for pre-market approval for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our product candidates are safe and effective for any indication;\n\u25cf\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical significance required by the FDA for approval;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, or may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf\nthe data collected from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of applications for regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner, or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling, or distribution and use restrictions;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may require development of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy as a condition of approval;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations that adversely affect our applications for pre-market approval; and\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may require simultaneous approval for both adults and for children and adolescents delaying needed approvals, or we may have successful clinical trial results for adults but not children and adolescents, or vice versa.\nBefore we can submit an application for regulatory approval in the United States, we must conduct a pivotal, Phase 3 trial. We will also need to agree on a protocol with the FDA for a clinical trial before commencing the trial. Phase 3 clinical trials frequently produce unsatisfactory results even though prior clinical trials were successful. Therefore, even if the results of our Phase 2 trials are successful, the results of the additional trials that we conduct may or may not be successful. Further, our product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their primary endpoints in Phase 3 clinical trials. The FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a clinical trial. The FDA or other regulatory agencies may require that we conduct additional clinical, nonclinical, manufacturing validation or drug product quality studies and submit those data before considering or reconsidering the application. Depending on the extent of these or any other studies, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA or other regulatory agencies.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may also approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may impose significant limitations related to use restrictions for certain age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or risk mitigation requirements.\nWe will continue to be subject to extensive FDA regulation following any product approvals, and if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may suffer a significant setback in our business.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to the requirements of and review by, the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in the areas of manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, adverse event reporting, labeling, advertising and promotional activities, among other things. In addition, any marketing approval we receive may be limited in terms of the approved product indication or require costly post-marketing testing and surveillance. Discovery after approval of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or manufacturing process, or a failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in enforcement actions such as:\n\u25cf\nwarning letters or other actions requiring changes in product manufacturing processes or restrictions on product marketing or distribution;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls or seizures or the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product from the market;\n\u25cf\nsuspending any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ntemporary or permanent injunctions against our production operations;\n\u25cf\nrefusal of our applications for pre-market approval or an investigational new drug application; and\n\u25cf\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue, the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\nThe occurrence of any of these actions would likely cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our business practices are subject to scrutiny and potential investigation by regulatory and government enforcement authorities, as well as to lawsuits brought by private citizens under federal and state laws. We could become subject to investigations, and our failure to comply with applicable law or an adverse decision in lawsuits may result in adverse consequences to us. If we fail to comply with U.S. healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWhile payment is not yet available from third-party payors (government or commercial) for our product, our goal is to obtain such coverage as soon as possible after product approval and commercial launch in the U.S. If this occurs, the availability of such payment would mean that many healthcare laws would place limitations and requirements on the manner in which we conduct our business (including our sales and promotional activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities) and could result in liability and exposure to us. In some instances, our interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities that occurred prior to commercialization could have implications at a later date. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others: (i) the federal healthcare programs Anti- Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid; (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us under theories of \u201cimplied certification\u201d where the government and qui tam relators may allege that device companies are liable where a product that was paid for by the government in whole or in part was promoted \u201coff-label,\u201d lacked necessary approval, or failed to comply with good manufacturing practices or other laws; (iii) transparency laws and related reporting and/or disclosures such as the Sunshine Act; and/or (iv) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. There are numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare pharmaceutical companies and others in the healthcare space, as well as their executives and managers. In addition, amendments to the Federal False Claims Act, have made it easier for private parties to bring quitam (whistleblower) lawsuits against companies under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended the federal civil False Claims Act to provide that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Penalties include substantial fines for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person or entity and/or exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, a majority of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false-claims provision. There can be no assurance that our activities will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen \"relators\" under federal or state false claims laws. Any future investigations of our business or executives, or enforcement action or prosecution, could cause us to incur substantial costs, and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.\nLaws impacting the U.S. healthcare system are subject to a great deal of uncertainty, which may result in adverse consequences to our business.\nThere have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding coverage from government or commercial payors. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely. Among other things, Congress has in the past proposed changes to and the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), and lawsuits have been brought challenging aspects of the law at various points. There have been repeated recent attempts by Congress to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to or any repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act, with respect to certain of its provisions or in its entirety. We are unable to predict what legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future at the state or federal level, or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us. Denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products, or the revocation or changes to coverage and reimbursement policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to build a pipeline of product candidates.\nA key element of our strategy is to use and expand our product platform to build a pipeline of product candidates, and progress those product candidates through clinical development for the treatment of a variety of different types of cancer. Even if we are successful in building a product pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development for a number of reasons, including causing harmful side effects or demonstrating other characteristics that indicate a low likelihood of receiving marketing approval or achieving market acceptance. If our methods of identifying potential product candidates fail to produce a pipeline of potentially viable product candidates, then our success as a business will be dependent on the success of fewer potential product candidates, which introduces risks to our business model and potential limitations to any success we may achieve.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the product\u2019s label;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to create a medication guide for distribution to patients that outlines the risks of such side effects;\n\u25cf\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication that does not produce any commercially viable products and may fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we must focus our efforts on particular research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Further, our resource allocation decisions may result in our use of funds for research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications that may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Any such failure to improperly assess potential product candidates could result in missed opportunities and/or our focus on product candidates with low market potential, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nOur products may be expensive to manufacture, and they may not be profitable if we are unable to control the costs to manufacture them.\nOur products may be significantly more expensive to manufacture than we expect or than other therapeutic products currently on the market today. We hope to substantially reduce manufacturing costs through process improvements, development of new methods, increases in manufacturing scale and outsourcing to experienced manufacturers. If we are not able to make these, or other improvements, and depending on the pricing of the product, our profit margins may be significantly less than that of other therapeutic products on the market today. In addition, we may not be able to charge a high enough price for any product we develop, even if they are safe and effective, to make a profit. If we are unable to realize significant profits from our potential product candidates, our business would be materially harmed.\nWe currently lack manufacturing capabilities to produce our therapeutic product candidates at commercial-scale quantities and do not have an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the product.\nWe expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential demand for our therapeutic product candidates, if approved. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. Even if we increase our manufacturing capabilities, it is possible that we may still lack sufficient capacity to meet demand.\nWe do not currently have any alternate supply for our products. If the facilities where our products are currently being manufactured or equipment were significantly damaged or destroyed, or if there were other disruptions, delays or difficulties affecting manufacturing capacity or availability of drug supply, including, but not limited to, if such facilities are deemed not in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements, future clinical studies and commercial production for our products would likely be significantly disrupted and delayed. It would be both time- consuming and expensive to replace this capacity with third parties, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the regulatory requirements.\nUltimately, if we are unable to supply our products to meet commercial demand, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, our production costs could dramatically increase and sales of our products and their long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\nTo be successful, our proposed products must be accepted by the healthcare community, which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products.\nOur proposed products and those developed by our collaborative partners, if approved for marketing, may not achieve market acceptance since hospitals, physicians, patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and use these products. The products that we are attempting to develop represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of more conventional therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies. The degree of market acceptance of any of our developed products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our proposed products;\n\u25cf\nour ability to create products that are superior to alternatives currently on the market;\n\u25cf\nour ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantage of our treatments over alternative treatment methods; and\n\u25cf\nreimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.\nIf the healthcare community does not accept our products for any of these reasons, or for any other reason, our business would be materially harmed.\nOur business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive and risky and may not be understood by or accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our future value.\nThe clinical development, commercialization and marketing of immuno-oncology therapies are at an early-stage, substantially research- oriented, and financially speculative. To date, very few companies have been successful in their efforts to develop and commercialize an immuno-oncology therapeutic product. In general, such products may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy, or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. Furthermore, the number of people who may use such therapies is difficult to forecast with accuracy. Our future success is dependent on the establishment of a significant market for such therapies and our ability to capture a share of this market with our product candidates.\nOur development efforts with our therapeutic product candidates are susceptible to the same risks of failure inherent in the development and commercialization of therapeutic products based on new technologies. The novel nature of immuno-oncology therapeutics creates significant challenges in the areas of product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance. For example, the FDA has relatively limited experience regulating such therapies, and there are few approved treatments using such therapy.\nOur competition includes fully integrated biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have significant advantages over us.\nThe market for therapeutic immuno-oncology products is highly competitive. We expect that our most significant competitors will be fully integrated and more established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or institutions, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. These companies are developing similar products, and they have significantly greater capital resources and research and development, manufacturing, testing, regulatory compliance, and marketing capabilities. Many of these potential competitors may be further along in the process of product development and also operate large, company-funded research and development programs. As a result, our competitors may develop more competitive or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we are able to achieve. Competitive products may render any products or product candidates that we develop obsolete.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in certain of our competitors. As a result, these companies may be able to obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we can and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing drug products that are more effective or less costly to produce or purchase on the market than any product candidate we are currently developing or that we may seek to develop in the future. If approved, our product candidates will face competition from commercially available drugs as well as drugs that are in the development pipelines of our competitors.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of or in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval, or discovering, developing and commercializing medicines before we do, which would have a material adverse impact on our business and ability to achieve profitability from future sales of our approved product candidates, if any.\nIf competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our product candidates or offer other advantages, our commercial prospects will be limited.\nOur therapeutic immuno-oncology development programs face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding, both in the United States and abroad. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of drugs and other therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting with our product candidates. According to a recent analysis by InVentiv Health there are over 800 companies developing approximately 1500 cancer immunotherapies via 4000 development projects across 535 targets. According to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Research Association Medicines in Development for Cancer 2018 Report, there were 135 drugs in development for the treatment of lymphoma, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which accounts for nearly five percent of all new cancer diagnoses.\nAs a general matter, we also face competition from many companies that are researching and developing cell therapies. Many of these companies have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience in testing pharmaceutical and other therapeutic products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and marketing and selling. If we ultimately obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we also will be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no commercial-scale experience. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources\u2019 being concentrated by our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of our technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields.\nIf we are unable to keep up with rapid technological changes in our field or compete effectively, we will be unable to operate profitably.\nWe are engaged in activities in the biotechnology field, which is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments, our ability to operate profitably could suffer. Research and discoveries by other biotechnology, agricultural, pharmaceutical or other companies may render our technologies or potential products or services uneconomical or result in products superior to those we develop. Similarly, any technologies, products or services we develop may not be preferred to any existing or newly developed technologies, products or services.\nWe may not be able to obtain third-party patient reimbursement or favorable product pricing, which would reduce our ability to operate profitably.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize certain of our proposed products in the human therapeutic field may depend to a significant degree on patient reimbursement of the costs of such products and related treatments at acceptable levels from government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations. Reimbursement in the United States or foreign countries may not be available for any products we may develop, and, if available, may be decreased in the future. Also, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products with a consequent harm to our business. We cannot predict what additional regulation or legislation relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such regulation or legislation may have on our business. If additional regulations are overly onerous or expensive, or if healthcare-related legislation makes our business more expensive or burdensome than originally anticipated, we may be forced to significantly downsize our business plans or completely abandon our business model.\nWe may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships, or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us. That litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, at the expense of other aspects of our business. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities, or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of liability claims, for which we may not have adequate insurance.\nSince we participate in the pharmaceutical industry, we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, end users and third parties. We intend to obtain proper insurance, however, there can be no assurance that any liability insurance we purchase will be adequate to cover claims asserted against us or that we will be able to maintain such insurance in the future. We intend to adopt prudent risk-management programs to reduce these risks and potential liabilities, however, we have not taken any steps to create these programs and have no estimate as to the cost or time required to do so and there can be no assurance that such programs, if and when adopted, will fully protect us. We may not be able to put risk management programs in place, or obtain insurance, if we are unable to retain the necessary expertise and/or are unsuccessful in raising necessary capital in the future. Our failure to obtain appropriate insurance, or to adopt and implement effective risk-management programs, as well as any adverse rulings in any legal matters, proceedings and other matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPreclinical and clinical trials are conducted during the development of potential products and other treatments to determine their safety and efficacy for use by humans. Notwithstanding these efforts, when our treatments are introduced into the marketplace, unanticipated side effects may become evident. Manufacturing, marketing, selling and testing our product candidates under development or to be acquired or licensed, entails a risk of product liability claims. We could be subject to product liability claims in the event that our product candidates, processes, or products under development fail to perform as intended. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources, and could damage our reputation and impair the marketability of our product candidates and processes. While we plan to maintain liability insurance for product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain or maintain such insurance at a commercially reasonable cost. If a successful claim were made against us, and we lacked insurance or the amount of insurance were inadequate to cover the costs of defending against or paying such a claim or the damages payable by us, we would experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to product liability lawsuits based on the use of our product candidates in clinical testing or, if obtained, following marketing approval and commercialization. If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to cease clinical testing or limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe could be subject to product liability lawsuits if any product candidate we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable for human use during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf\nloss of revenues from product sales; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur inability to retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the clinical testing and commercialization of products we develop. We may wish to obtain additional such insurance covering studies or trials in other countries should we seek to expand those clinical trials or commence new clinical trials in other jurisdictions or increase the number of patients in any clinical trials we may pursue. We also may determine that additional types and amounts of coverage would be desirable at later stages of clinical development of our product candidates or upon commencing commercialization of any product candidate that obtains required approvals. However, we may not be able to obtain any such additional insurance coverage when needed on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not obtain or retain sufficient product liability insurance, we could be responsible for some or all of the financial costs associated with a product liability claim relating to our preclinical and clinical development activities, in the event that any such claim results in a court judgment or settlement in an amount or of a type that is not covered, in whole or in part, by any insurance policies we may have or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay any such amounts that may not be covered by our insurance policies.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, upon third-party CROs to execute our preclinical and clinical trials and to monitor and manage data produced by and relating to those trials. However, we may not be able to establish arrangements with CROs when needed or on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could negatively affect our development efforts with respect to our drug product candidates and materially harm our business, operations and prospects.\nWe will have only limited control over the activities of the CRO we will engage to conduct our clinical trials including the University of Minnesota for our phase 1/2 clinical trial for GTB-3550. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on any CRO does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. Based on our present expectations, we, our CROs and our clinical trial sites are required to comply with good clinical practices, or GCPs, for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in the applicable trial may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving a product candidate for marketing, which we may not have sufficient cash or other resources to support and which would delay our ability to generate revenue from any sales of such product candidate. In addition, our clinical trials are required to be conducted with product produced in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMPs. Our or our CROs\u2019 failure to comply with those regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would also require significant cash expenditures and delay the regulatory approval process.\nAgreements governing relationships with CROs generally provide those CROs with certain rights to terminate a clinical trial under specified circumstances. If a CRO that we have engaged terminates its relationship with us during the performance of a clinical trial, we would be forced to seek an engagement with a substitute CRO, which we may not be able to do on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and the applicable trial would experience delays or may not be completed. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under any agreements we enter with them, we are unable to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to a failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, the affected product candidates. As a result, our operations and the commercial prospects for the effected product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe contract with third parties for the supply of product candidates for clinical testing and expect to contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for large-scale testing and commercial supply. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe anticipate continuing our engagement of third parties to provide our clinical supply as we advance our product candidates into and through clinical development, and we depend on third parties to produce and maintain sufficient quantities of material to supply our clinical trials. If these third parties do not produce and maintain adequate supplies of clinical material, our development efforts could be significantly delayed, or could incur substantially higher costs. We expect in the future to use third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture. We plan to enter into long-term supply agreements with several manufacturers for commercial supplies. We may be unable to reach agreement on satisfactory terms with contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates. Additionally, the facilities to manufacture our product candidates must be the subject of a satisfactory inspection before the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve a marketing authorization for the product candidate manufactured at that facility. We will depend on these third-party manufacturers for compliance with the FDA\u2019s and international regulatory authority requirements for the manufacture of our finished products. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs. If our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the FDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 cGMP requirements, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved, and may subject us to recalls or enforcement action for products already on the market.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved and contract manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and could lose potential revenue. It may take several years to establish an alternative source of supply for our product candidates and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any other relevant regulatory authorities.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales force. If we are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to effectively market and sell our product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenues.\nWe currently do not have a marketing or sales team for the marketing, sales and distribution of any of our product candidates that are able to obtain regulatory approval. In order to commercialize any product candidates, we must build on a territory-by-territory basis marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we intend to establish an internal sales and marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of any of our products that we obtain approval to market. With respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and we may incur substantial costs to attempt to recover or reproduce the data. If any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and/or the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, power loss, terrorist activity and other events beyond our control, the occurrence of which could materially harm our business.\nBusinesses located in California have, in the past, been subject to electrical blackouts as a result of a shortage of available electrical power, and any future blackouts could disrupt our operations. We are vulnerable to a major earthquake, wildfire and other natural disasters, and we have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business as a result of any such natural disaster and do not have an applicable recovery plan in place. We do not carry any business interruption insurance that would compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could cause our business to materially suffer.\nEpidemic or pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19 (coronavirus), natural disasters, whether or not caused by climate change, unusual weather conditions, terrorist acts and political events, could disrupt business and result in halting our clinical trials and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist attacks or disruptive political events in certain regions where our operations are located could adversely affect our business. Epidemic or pandemic outbreaks, such as COVID-19 (coronavirus) could impact our management and our ability to conduct clinical trials. This also may affect the market conditions that would limit our ability to raise additional capital. This could have a sustained material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have not held regular annual meetings in the past, and if we are required by the Delaware Court of Chancery to hold an annual meeting pursuant to Section 211(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, it could result in the unanticipated expenditure of funds, time and other Company resources.\nSection 2.2 of our bylaws provides that an annual meeting shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by our board of directors, and Section 211(b) of the DGCL provides for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held for the election of directors. Section 211(c) of the DGCL provides that if there is a failure to hold the annual meeting for a period of 13 months after the latest to occur of the organization of the corporation, its last annual meeting or last action by written consent to elect directors in lieu of an annual meeting, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a meeting to be held upon the application of any stockholder or director. Section 211(c) also provides that the failure to hold an annual meeting shall not affect otherwise valid corporate acts or result in a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation.\nWe have not held regular annual meetings in the past because a substantial majority of our stock is owned by a small number of stockholders, making it easy to obtain written consent in lieu of a meeting when necessary. In light of our historical liquidity constraints, handling matters by written consent has allowed our Company to save on the financial and administrative resources required to prepare for and hold such annual meetings. To our knowledge, no stockholder or director has requested our Company\u2019s management to hold such an annual meeting and no stockholder or director has applied to the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking an order directing our company to hold a meeting. However, if one or more stockholders or directors were to apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking such an order, and if the Delaware Court of Chancery were to order an annual meeting before we are prepared to hold one, the preparation for the annual meeting and the meeting itself could result in the unanticipated expenditure of funds, time, and other Company resources.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere has been a limited public market for our common stock, and we do not know whether one will develop to provide you adequate liquidity. Furthermore, the trading price for our common stock, should an active trading market develop, may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in per-share price.\nOur common stock is now listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol \u201cGTBP\u201d; historically, however, there has been a limited public market for our common stock. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. The liquidity of any market for the shares of our common stock will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe number of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nour operating performance and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of coverage of us by securities or industry analysts; and\n\u25cf\nthe interest of securities dealers in making a market in the shares of our common stock.\nEven if an active trading market develops, the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the price of shares of our common stock could decline significantly if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors and actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect our share price.\nOther factors may also contribute to volatility of the price of our common stock and could subject our common stock to wide fluctuations. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u25cf\nsignificant sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf\nvariations in interest rates;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of other comparable companies; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting principles.\nOur outstanding warrants may affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of April 12, 2021, we had approximately 28.4 million shares of common stock outstanding and issued or issuable and had outstanding warrants for the purchase of up to approximately 78,400 additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.40 per share, warrants for the purchase of up to approximately 4,268,280 additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share and warrants for the purchase of up to approximately 247,250 additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.875 per share, all of which are exercisable as of the date of this prospectus (subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations). The amount of common stock reserved for issuance may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of our common stock in the public market. In addition, the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current stockholders\u2019 ownership.\nBecause our common stock may be deemed a low-priced \u201cpenny\u201d stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high- risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nHistorically, the trading price of our common stock has been $5.00 per share or lower, and deemed a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, and subject to the penny stock rules of the Exchange Act specified in rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u25cf\ndeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u25cf\ndisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u25cf\ndisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\nsend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u25cf\nin some circumstances, approve the purchaser\u2019s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell the common stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer before recommending an investment to a customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares of common stock, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares of common stock, and thereby depress our price per share of common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have research coverage by only one securities analyst, and we may never obtain research coverage by additional analysts. If no or few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock may be negatively affected. In the event that we receive additional securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nDelaware law and our charter, bylaws, and other governing documents contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe do not currently or for the foreseeable future intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result, any return on your investment in our common stock will be limited to the appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any.", "PERMNO": 29744, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "GTBP"}
