{"cik": "1015780", "company": "E TRADE FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion sets forth the risk factors which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and should be carefully considered in addition to the other information set forth in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem to be material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Nature and Operation of Our Business\nChanges in business, economic, or political conditions could impact trading volumes, margin lending and sweep deposits, resulting in lower revenues.\nServices provided to retail customers, including trading, margin lending and sweep deposits, account for a significant portion of our revenues. Changes in business, economic or political conditions could cause a downturn in the global financial markets. Such a downturn could decrease the volume of customer transactions which may, in turn, result in lower trading-based revenue, fees and service charges, and a decrease in margin lending, which would reduce our interest income earned on margin receivables. Changes in business, economic or political conditions could also result in our customers reducing their cash allocations or transferring cash away from us, either of which could negatively impact the amount of sweep deposits our customers maintain with the Company and reduce net revenue.\nWe may be unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates on our business.\nNet interest income is our most significant source of revenue and our ability to manage interest rate risk could impact our financial condition. Our results of operations depend, in part, on our level of net interest income and our effective management of the impact of changing interest rates and varying asset and liability maturities. We use derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations. However, the derivatives we utilize may not be effective at managing this risk and changes in market interest rates and the yield curve could reduce the value of our financial assets and reduce our net interest income.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 12\nNet interest margin may fluctuate based on the size and mix of the balance sheet, as well as the impact of the interest rate environment. Rising interest rates and other market factors may cause the Company's funding costs to increase and the value of our debt securities to decrease. Increases in funding costs without offsetting increases in asset yields, especially when a flattened or inverted yield curve persists over a sustained period of time, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact net interest income. For example, recent reforms, when effective after 2021, may cause the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to perform differently than in the past, or be replaced as a benchmark. Although it is not possible to predict the effects of the reform, it could result in, among other things, a reduction in the interest payments we receive, reductions in the value of securities with floating interest rates that we hold, and an increase in the dividend payments on our preferred stock and in the interest payments on certain of our borrowings.\nWe rely heavily on technology, which can be subject to interruption and instability due to operational and technological failures, both internal and external.\nWe rely on technology, particularly the internet and mobile services, to conduct much of our business activity and allow our customers to conduct financial transactions. Our systems and operations, including our primary and disaster recovery data center operations, as well as those of the third parties on whom we rely to conduct certain key functions, are vulnerable to disruptions from natural disasters, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, software bugs, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial of service attacks, spam attacks, phishing or other social engineering, ransomware, security breaches, credential stuffing, technological failure, human error, terrorism and other similar events. In addition, extraordinary trading volumes or site usage could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Disruptions to, destruction of, instability of or other failure to effectively maintain our information technology systems or external technology that allows our customers to use our products and services could harm our business and our reputation.\nShould our technology operations be disrupted, we may have to make significant investments to upgrade, repair or replace our technology infrastructure and may not be able to make such investments on a timely basis. While we have made significant investments designed to enhance the reliability and scalability of our operations, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain, expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to meet future requirements and mitigate future risks on a timely basis. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could interrupt our business and result in substantial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction, customer attrition, fines, litigation, and harm to our reputation. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from operational and technological failures and we cannot be certain that such insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to perform certain key functions, and their failure to perform those functions could result in the interruption of our operations and systems and could result in significant costs and reputational damage to us.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for certain technology, security, processing, servicing and support functions. These providers are susceptible to operational, technological and security vulnerabilities, including security breaches, which may impact our business. In addition, these third-party service providers may rely on other parties (sub-contractors) to provide services to us that face similar risks. For example, third-party service providers provide us with certain transaction processing and customer-facing support services, as well as financial information, market news, quotes, research reports and other fundamental data that we offer to customers.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 13\nWe have third party oversight capabilities, including processes to evaluate third-party providers, designed to verify that the third-party service providers can support the functionality, security and stability of our operations and systems. However, these processes may be insufficient and we cannot assure that we will not experience an operational, technological or security failure as a result of a third-party service provider. Any significant failure by or of our third-party service providers or their sub-contractors that result in an interruption in service, unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data or other similar occurrences, including failures as a result of natural disasters, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, software bugs, acts of vandalism, actual or perceived cyber attacks, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial of service attacks, spam attacks, phishing or other social engineering, or ransomware could interrupt our business, cause us to incur losses, result in decreased customer service and satisfaction and increased customer attrition, subject us to fines or litigation and harm our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any third-party service provider and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could have a material impact on our ability to offer certain products and services and cause us to incur losses and could lead to a general loss of customer confidence. We cannot assure that any of these third-party service providers or their sub-contractors will be able to continue to provide their products and services in an efficient, reliable, secure, legally compliant or cost effective manner, if at all, or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and those of our customers, if necessary. Although we may have contractual protections with our third-party service providers, any actual or perceived security breach could harm our reputation and brand, expose us to potential liability or require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to any such actual or perceived breach. Any contractual protections we may have from our third-party service providers may not be sufficient to adequately protect us from any such liabilities and losses, and we may be unable to enforce any such contractual protections.\nWe expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for any deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and for the performance of such third parties. If there were deficiencies in the oversight and control of our third-party relationships, and if our regulators held us responsible for those deficiencies, our business, reputation, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnauthorized disclosure, use, modification or misappropriation of our data may subject us to significant liability and reputational harm as well as reduced revenues and increased costs.\nAs part of our business, we are required to collect, transmit, store and otherwise process sensitive and confidential customer and employee data, including personally identifiable information and similar information as defined by applicable federal, state, and international laws and regulations (collectively \"Personal Information\"), third-party data, and our proprietary and confidential information, including intellectual property and trade secrets. We maintain, and we contractually require our third-party service providers who have access to Personal Information to maintain, systems and procedures designed to securely collect, transmit, store and otherwise process sensitive and confidential information (including Personal Information) and to protect against unauthorized access to and disclosure of such information. However, risks associated with the collection, transmission, storage and other processing of sensitive and confidential data have grown in recent years due to increasing use of the internet and mobile technologies, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, and other external parties. Like other financial services firms, we experience malicious cyber activity directed at our computer systems, software, networks, and users, including phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering and credential stuffing, attempted unauthorized access, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, security breaches, spam attacks, and other cyber attacks. Furthermore, parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, clients, third parties or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Security and privacy threats could derive from third parties, malicious employees or insiders, human error, or technological failures. In 2013, we, and other financial institutions, experienced a cyber incident that resulted in certain customer contact information being compromised and potentially accessed by unauthorized third parties. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are unaware of any financial fraud or\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 14\nother misuse of customer data resulting from this incident. We are cooperating with government agencies in connection with their investigation.\nWe have continued to invest in security measures, but, despite these investments, we, our customers and our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventative measures against cyber attacks or security or privacy breaches, which could result in theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of systems or data, interruptions in service, impacts on financial data reporting, theft of intellectual property, or other similar events. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against any potential security breaches or failures and their consequences.\nAn actual or perceived breach of the security of our technology or media (whether social or traditional media), the reporting or announcement of such an event, or reports of perceived security vulnerabilities of our systems or the systems of our third-party service providers, whether accurate or not, or our failure or perceived failure to respond or remediate an event or make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, result in regulatory actions from state or federal governmental authorities and significant fines, orders and sanctions, disrupt our operations, increase our costs with respect to investigations and remediations, reduce our revenues as a result of the theft of intellectual property, distract our management and otherwise have a materially adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if securities analysts or investor perceive these announcements to be negative, it could, among other things, have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Further, any actual or perceived security breach or cyber attack directed at other financial institutions or financial services companies, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in the use of technology to conduct financial transactions, which could negatively impact us, including the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and technology infrastructure. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nA security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a security breach could take a substantial amount of time, and during such time we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of such a breach. Further, detecting and remediating such incidents may require specialized expertise and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or hire individuals who possess, or otherwise internally develop, such expertise. Our remediation efforts therefore may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain, and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there could be public announcements regarding any data security-related incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents. Consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet, and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses or those of third parties with whom we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business may discourage consumers from doing business with us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any person, including any of our employees, contractors or other agents, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client, employee or third-party data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.\nAs our business model relies heavily on our customers\u2019 use of their own personal computers, mobile devices and the internet, our business and reputation could be harmed by security breaches of our customers and third parties. Computer viruses and other attacks on our customers\u2019 personal computer systems, home networks and mobile devices or against the third-party networks and systems of internet and mobile service providers could create losses for our customers even without any breach in the security of our systems, and could thereby harm our business and our reputation. As part of our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee, we reimburse our customers for certain losses caused by a breach of security of our\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 15\ncustomers\u2019 own personal systems. Such reimbursements may not be covered by applicable insurance and could have a material impact on our financial performance and results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable, prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business, it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from security breaches, cyber attacks and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions from such events. We cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct all of our operations through subsidiaries and rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for a substantial amount of our cash flows.\nWe depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including our debt obligations, payments of cash dividends to holders of our preferred stock, as well as capital returns to holders of our common stock. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds to or from certain subsidiaries, including E*TRADE Securities, E*TRADE Bank, and E*TRADE Savings Bank. In addition, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to us, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations, including our debt obligations, and otherwise conduct our business by, among other things, reducing our liquidity in the form of corporate cash. In addition to negatively affecting our business, a significant decrease in our liquidity could also reduce client confidence in E*TRADE.\nUnder applicable rules, a dividend in excess of 10% of a member firm\u2019s excess net capital may not be paid without FINRA\u2019s prior written approval. Compliance with these rules may impede our ability to receive dividends from E*TRADE Securities. Additionally, a savings bank that is part of a savings and loan holding company structure, such as E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank, must file a notice of a declaration of a dividend with the Federal Reserve at least 30 days before the proposed dividend declaration by the bank\u2019s board of directors. OCC regulations set forth the circumstances under which a federal savings bank is required to submit an application or notice before it may make a dividend or capital distribution. See Business-Regulation for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2019, much of our capital was invested in our banking subsidiary, E*TRADE Bank. The Federal Reserve and/or OCC may object to a proposed dividend or capital distribution if, among other things, E*TRADE Bank is, or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be, undercapitalized or it has safety and soundness concerns. We cannot be certain, however, that we will receive regulatory approval for such contemplated dividends at the requested levels or at all.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry where many of our competitors have greater resources and may have product suites that may appeal to our current or potential customers.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, with multiple industry participants competing for the same customers. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than we have and offer a wider range of financial products and services. The impact of competitors with superior name recognition, greater market acceptance, larger customer bases or stronger capital positions could adversely affect our revenue growth and customer retention. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand changing market conditions better than we can, especially larger competitors that may benefit from more diversified product and\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 16\ncustomer bases. Competitors may conduct extensive promotional activities, offering better terms, lower prices, pay higher interest rates on deposits, or offer different products and services that could attract current and prospective E*TRADE customers and potentially result in intensified price competition within the industry. We continue to experience aggressive price competition in the industry, including the elimination of retail commissions for online US listed stock, ETFs, and options trades, reduced options contract charges and various free trade offers. We may not be able to match the marketing efforts or prices of our competitors. Some of our competitors may also benefit from established relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their products and services and from consolidation with other competitors.\nIn addition, we compete in a technology-intensive industry characterized by rapid innovation. Some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or scrutiny to which we are subject, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, in particular in the development of new technology platforms or the ability to rapidly innovate. We may be unable to effectively use new technologies, adapt our services to emerging industry standards or develop, introduce and market enhanced or new products and services. If we are not able to update or adapt our products and services to take advantage of the latest technologies and standards, or are otherwise unable to tailor the delivery of our services to the latest personal and mobile computing devices preferred by our retail customers, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the financial services industry depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nMaintaining and expanding our market position\n\u2022\nAttracting and retaining customers\n\u2022\nProviding easy to use and innovative financial products and services\n\u2022\nOur reputation and the market perception of our brand and overall value\n\u2022\nMaintaining competitive pricing\n\u2022\nCompeting in a concentrated competitive landscape\n\u2022\nThe effectiveness of our technology (including cyber security defenses), products and services\n\u2022\nDeploying a secure and scalable technology and back office platform\n\u2022\nInnovating effectively in launching new or enhanced products\n\u2022\nThe differences in regulatory oversight regimes to which we and our competitors are subject\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and industry trends, including customer demand for financial products and services\nOur competitive position within the industry could be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately address these factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected due to risks related to our mergers and acquisitions and the subsequent business integrations.\nWe consider opportunistic acquisitions to grow our existing business, add new technologies, or expand distribution. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate businesses or acquired assets, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. Transactions that we consummate would involve risks and uncertainties to us, including mispricing the inherent value of an acquired entity, as well as potential difficulties integrating people, systems and customers and realizing synergies.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 17\nWe completed the acquisition of Gradifi in the fourth quarter of 2019, the acquisition of retail brokerage accounts from Capital One Financial Corporation (Capital One) in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the acquisition of Trust Company of America (TCA) in the second quarter of 2018. The acquisitions subject us to a number of risks, uncertainties, and potential costs. The risks associated with these transactions and any future transactions include:\n\u2022\nWe may experience significant attrition in the acquired customers, accounts and assets under custody, and our retention of the accounts and assets may be impacted by our ability to successfully integrate the acquired operations, products and personnel\n\u2022\nWe could be subject to undisclosed liabilities that could be material or become subject to litigation or regulatory risks as a result of the acquisition\n\u2022\nManagement\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business initiatives\n\u2022\nUnanticipated restructuring and other integration costs may be incurred\n\u2022\nWe will have less cash available for other purposes, including for use in acquisitions or the development of other technologies or products\nAny future transactions could involve these and additional risks. Our ability to pursue additional strategic transactions may also be limited by our corporate debt, including our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock. Future acquisitions may also be funded through the issuance of additional debt or preferred stock.\nAny of these risks, whether with respect to the current or any future transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur risk management practices may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.\nAs a financial services company, our business exposes us to certain risks. We seek to monitor and manage our significant risk exposures through a set of board-approved limits as well as Key Risk Indicators or metrics. We have adopted a governance framework which includes reporting of these metrics and other significant risks and exposures to management and the board of directors. See MD&A-Risk Management for additional information. However, our risk management methods may not identify future risk exposures and may not be effective in mitigating our key risks. Furthermore, our risk management methods may not properly identify and mitigate the aggregation of risks across our organization or the interdependency of our risk mitigation efforts. In addition, some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets, customers and other matters that are based on assumptions that may not be accurate. A failure to manage our risk effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 18\nProviding investment advice and recommendations subjects us to additional risks.\nWe provide investment advice and recommendations to investors to aid them in their decision making. We also provide a variety of investment education and tools to our clients that we do not consider investment advice or an investment recommendation, including web-based educational seminars for new customers, introductions to the equities and options markets, and retirement planning tools. Investment recommendations and suggestions are based on publicly available documents and communications with investors regarding investment preferences and risk tolerances. Publicly available documents may be inaccurate and misleading, resulting in recommendations or transactions that are inconsistent with investors\u2019 intended results. In addition, our Financial Consultants\u2019 recommendations may not fulfill regulatory requirements as a result of their failing to collect sufficient information about a customer or failing to understand the customer\u2019s needs or risk tolerances. Risks associated with providing investment advice and recommendations also include those arising from how we disclose and address possible conflicts of interest, inadequate due diligence, inadequate disclosure, human error and fraud. New regulations, such as the SEC's Regulation Best Interest, will impose heightened conduct standards and requirements when we provide recommendations to retail investors. In addition, various states are considering potential regulations that could impose additional standards of conduct or other obligations on us when we provide investment advice or recommendations to retail investors and possibly to all of our clients. To the extent that we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements, fail to know our customers, improperly advise our customers, or risks associated with advisory services otherwise materialize, we could be found liable for losses suffered by such customers, or could be subject to regulatory fines, and civil penalties, any of which could harm our reputation and business.\nWe may suffer losses due to credit risk associated with margin lending, securities lending transactions, our investment and mortgage loan portfolios or other financial transactions.\nWe permit certain customers to purchase securities on margin and borrow against their securities holdings. A downturn in securities markets may impact the value of collateral held in connection with margin receivables and assets pledged for securities-based lending and may reduce its value below the amount borrowed, potentially creating collections issues if deficiencies are not remediated timely. In addition, we frequently borrow securities from and lend securities to other broker-dealers. Under regulatory guidelines, when we borrow or lend securities, we must simultaneously disburse or receive cash deposits. A sharp change in security market values may result in losses if counterparties to the borrowing and lending transactions default on their obligations. Even without defaults, the value of debt securities may be negatively affected by the credit deterioration of a security's issuer. We also engage in financial transactions with counterparties, including repurchase agreements and hedging transactions, that expose us to credit losses in the event counterparties cannot meet their obligations.\nOur mortgage loan portfolio represents our most significant credit risk exposure. At December 31, 2019, the principal balance of our one-to four-family loan portfolio was $803 million with an allowance for loan losses of $6 million. The principal balance of our home equity loan portfolio was $635 million with an allowance for loan losses of $11 million. Certain characteristics of our mortgage loan portfolio indicate an additional risk of loss, including lien position and geographical concentration. Actual loan defaults and delinquencies that exceed our current expectations could negatively impact our financial performance. In the normal course of conducting examinations, our banking regulators, the OCC and Federal Reserve, continue to review our policies and procedures. This process is dynamic and ongoing and we cannot be certain that additional changes or actions to our policies and procedures will not result from their continuing review. Due to the complexity and judgment required by management regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, there can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate. See MD&A-Risk Management for additional information.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 19\nWe face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nThe market for qualified personnel in the financial services industry, particularly skilled information technology personnel, is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.\nOur corporate debt may restrict how we conduct our business and failure to comply with the terms of our corporate debt could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have $1.4 billion of corporate debt and have the capacity to incur $300 million in additional indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, subject to certain covenant requirements. Our expected annual debt service interest payment is approximately $52 million. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nA portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate needs may be limited\n\u2022\nOur ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or our business\nOur senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our corporate debt place limitations on our ability, and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nCreate liens\n\u2022\nMerge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets\n\u2022\nWith respect to our subsidiaries only, incur additional indebtedness\nThe senior unsecured revolving credit facility also contains certain financial covenants, including that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum total leverage ratio and certain capitalization requirements for the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries.\nWe could be forced to repay immediately any outstanding borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and outstanding debt securities at their full principal amount if we were to breach their respective covenants and not cure such breach, even if we otherwise meet our debt service obligations. If we experience a change in control, as defined in the senior unsecured revolving credit facility, we could be required to repay all loans outstanding under the credit facility at their full principal amount plus any accrued interest or fees.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition, operating performance and our ability to receive dividend payments from our subsidiaries, which are subject to certain business, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory approval or notification, and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 20\nAny failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness could be at a higher interest rate or include covenants that are more restrictive than our current covenants.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Business\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation. Our brokerage and investment adviser subsidiaries must comply with many laws and rules, including rules relating to the provision of investment advice, sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to customers, possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending, execution and settlement of transactions and AML. E*TRADE Financial Corporation, as a savings and loan holding company, and E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank, as federally chartered savings banks, are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the CFPB, and, in the case of E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank, the FDIC. Such regulation and supervision covers all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, recordkeeping, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel.\nIn addition, our results of operations could be affected by regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, customer privacy and security of customer data. If we fail to establish and enforce procedures to comply with applicable regulations, our failure could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we have implemented policies and procedures designed to provide for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, regulators have broad discretion with respect to the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that violations will not occur. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and our policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, litigation, civil penalties and harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or non-objection, our regulators may make their approval or non-objection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew or amended legislation or regulations, rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations and new or amended guidance and supervisory practices could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, LIBOR is used in many of our systems and significant work may be required to transition to new benchmark rates following the expected phase-out of LIBOR. This may impact our existing financial models, transaction data, products, systems, operations and pricing processes. For further information on how ongoing regulatory reform could affect us, see Business-Regulation.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable securities and banking laws, rules and regulations, either domestically or internationally, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, litigation, investigations, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business.\nThe financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to arbitration claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business, as well as class actions and other significant litigation. We also are the subject of inquiries, investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. Actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties and other results adverse to us. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult,\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 21\nparticularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants or by a large number of claimants, when claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows, or could cause us significant reputational harm, which could harm our business prospects. In market downturns, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. We are also subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant resources, regardless of whether the claims have merit. If we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using the relevant technology or providing related products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe SEC, FINRA and other SROs and state securities commissions, among other things, can censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. Clearing securities firms, such as E*TRADE Securities, are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than introducing brokers that rely on others to perform clearing functions. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state could bring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws. Regulatory agencies in countries outside of the US have similar authority. The ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is dependent in part on the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable compliance function. The failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions.\nThe Federal Reserve has primary jurisdiction for the supervision and regulation of savings and loan holding companies, including the Company; and the OCC has primary supervision and regulation of federal savings banks, such as the Company\u2019s two federal savings bank subsidiaries. Although the Dodd-Frank Act maintained the federal thrift charter, it eliminated certain preemption, branching and other benefits of the charter and imposed new penalties for failure to comply with the QTL test.\nWe are required to file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and are subject to examination and supervision by it. The Federal Reserve also has certain types of enforcement powers over us, including the ability to issue cease-and-desist orders, force divestiture of our savings bank subsidiaries and impose civil and monetary penalties for violations of federal banking laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve has issued regulation and guidance that generally aligns the supervisory and regulatory standards of savings and loan holding companies more closely with the standards applicable to bank holding companies. Our savings bank subsidiaries are also subject to reporting, examination, supervision and enforcement oversight by the OCC. For all insured depository institutions, including savings banks with total consolidated assets over $10 billion, such as E*TRADE Bank, as well as their affiliates, the CFPB has exclusive rulemaking and examination, and primary enforcement authority, under federal consumer financial laws and regulations. In addition, states may adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB.\nThe EGRRCPA, enacted in 2018, relieved the Company of certain regulatory burdens to which it had become subject as a result of surpassing $50 billion in total consolidated assets on a four-quarter average basis in 2017. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board finalized a rulemaking in November 2019 that applies certain requirements to savings and loan holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. While the Company currently does not surpass that threshold, it could in the future. We anticipate that regulators will continue to intensify their supervision through the exam process and increase their enforcement of regulations across the industry. The regulators' heightened expectations and intense supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 22\nIf we do not maintain the capital and liquidity levels required by regulators, we may be fined or subject to other disciplinary or corrective actions.\nThe SEC, FINRA, the OCC, the CFTC, the Federal Reserve and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers and regulatory capital by banks.\nFailure to maintain the required net capital by our securities broker-dealer or FCM could result in suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC or suspension or expulsion by FINRA, the CFTC or the NFA, as applicable, and could ultimately lead to these entities' liquidation. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require an intensive use of capital could be limited. Such operations may include investing activities, marketing and the financing of customer account balances. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from brokerage subsidiaries could be restricted.\nE*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC, and the Company is subject to specific capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could affect the operations and financial performance of these entities. The capital amounts and classifications of the Company, E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators of these entities, including about the strength of components of their capital, risk weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions and other factors. Any significant reduction in the Company\u2019s, E*TRADE Bank\u2019s or E*TRADE Savings Bank's regulatory capital could result in them being less than \"well capitalized\" or \"adequately capitalized\" under applicable capital standards. A failure to be \"adequately capitalized\" that is not cured within time periods specified in the credit agreement for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility would constitute a default under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and likely result in any outstanding balance on the senior unsecured revolving credit facility becoming immediately due and payable. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits the acceptance, renewal or roll-over of \u201cbrokered deposits\u201d by depository institutions that are not \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d unless a depository institution is \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d and receives a waiver from the FDIC. Sweep deposits that qualify as \u201cbrokered deposits\u201d are a significant source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank, and if they were terminated by the FDIC, that could have a material negative effect on our business. If we fail to meet certain capital requirements, the Federal Reserve and the OCC may request we raise equity or otherwise increase the regulatory capital of the Company, E*TRADE Bank or E*TRADE Savings Bank. If we were unable to raise equity or otherwise increase capital, we could face negative regulatory consequences, including under the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d framework, such as restrictions on our activities and requirements that we dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. Any such actions could have a material negative effect on our business.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 23\nAs a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to activity limitations and requirements that could restrict our ability to engage in certain activities and take advantage of certain business opportunities.\nUnder applicable law, our banking activities are restricted to those that are financial in nature or specifically authorized by law, such as certain real estate-related activities. Although we believe all of our existing activities and investments are permissible, we are unable to pursue future activities that are not financial in nature or otherwise authorized. We are also limited in our ability to invest in other savings and loan holding companies. Various other laws and regulations require savings and loan holding companies such as the Company, as well as our savings bank subsidiaries, to be both \"well capitalized\" and \"well managed\" in order for us to conduct certain financial activities, such as securities underwriting. We believe that we will be able to continue to engage in all of our current financial activities. However, if we and our savings bank subsidiaries are unable to satisfy the \"well capitalized\" and \"well managed\" requirements, we could be subject to activity restrictions that could prevent us from engaging in certain activities as well as other negative regulatory actions.\nIn addition, E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank are currently subject to extensive regulation of their activities and investments, capitalization, community reinvestment, risk management policies and procedures and relationships with affiliated companies. Acquisitions of, and mergers with, other financial institutions, purchases of deposits and loan portfolios, the establishment of new depository institution subsidiaries and the commencement of certain new activities by these subsidiaries require the prior approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve, and in some cases the FDIC, any of which may deny approval or condition their approval on the imposition of limitations on the scope of our planned activity. Also, these regulations and conditions could affect our ability to realize synergies from future acquisitions, negatively affect us following an acquisition and also delay or prevent the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services.\nOur collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information could give rise to significant costs and liabilities, including as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights, which may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn providing services to customers, we manage, use, store, disclose, transfer and otherwise process a large volume of consumer and customer data, including Personal Information and other sensitive information. We are subject to numerous data protection laws and regulations, such as US federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of Personal Information and other consumer and customer data, including, but not limited to, the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the CCPA. These laws and regulations have increased in complexity and number, change frequently and can conflict with one another. In certain cases, they provide a private right of action, which may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. As we seek to expand our business, we are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws, regulations and standards, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our affiliates and other parties with whom we conduct business. These laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the interpretation and application of the extraterritorial application of certain foreign regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation, is unclear at this time. The regulatory framework for data privacy and security worldwide is continuously evolving and developing and, as a result, interpretation and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nMany statutory requirements, both in the United States and abroad, include obligations for companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving certain personal information, which could result from\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 24\nbreaches experienced by us or our third-party service providers. For example, laws in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. These laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. We also may be contractually required to notify consumers or other counterparties of a security breach.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning data privacy and security, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. New laws, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. Because the interpretation and application of laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to data privacy and security are still uncertain, it is possible that the scope and requirements of these laws may be interpreted and applied broadly by various jurisdictions, and in a manner that is inconsistent with our understanding and practices and with other legal requirements. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, public censure, other claims and penalties, and significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be materially and adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our data processing practices and policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner, or at all. Any inability to adequately address data privacy or security-related concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could result in additional cost and liability to us, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with consumers and have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe make public statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policies, information provided on our website and press statements. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Moreover, from time to time, concerns may be expressed about whether our products and services compromise the privacy of consumers and others. Any concerns about our data privacy and security practices, even if unfounded, could damage the reputation of our businesses, discourage potential users from our products and services and have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws, regulations, standards, certifications or orders relating to data privacy, security or consumer protection, or any compromise of security that results in the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of personal information or other user data, could result in fines or proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or consumers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant awards, penalties or judgments, one or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if our practices are not consistent, or viewed as not consistent, with legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in laws, regulations and standards or new interpretations or applications of existing laws, regulations and standards, we may also become subject to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, all of which may affect our financial condition, operating results and our reputation.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 25\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Stock\nThe value of our common stock may be diluted if we need additional funds in the future and is subject to the liquidation preference of our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional funds via the issuance and sale of our debt or equity instruments, which we may not be able to conduct on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital needs and our plans for the growth of our business.\nIn addition, if funds are available, the issuance of equity securities could significantly dilute the value of our shares of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to fall. We have the ability to issue a significant number of shares of stock in future transactions, which would substantially dilute existing stockholders, without seeking further stockholder approval. We have issued $700 million aggregate liquidation preference of preferred stock in two series, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Future issuances and sales of preferred stock or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may also cause prevailing market prices for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us.\nOur future ability to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018 we announced the declaration of a quarterly dividend on shares of our common stock and have continued to declare such dividends quarterly during 2019. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors that the board of directors deems relevant, including future earnings, the success of our business activities, capital requirements, the general financial condition and future prospects of our business and general business conditions. If we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock; however, even with sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, our board of directors may exercise its discretion by not declaring a dividend on our common stock. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to statutory and regulatory limitations. As noted above, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries to fund payments of cash dividends to holders of our common stock and such subsidiaries may not pay dividends without the non-objection, or in certain cases the approval, of their regulators.\nThe failure to declare or pay a quarterly dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our capital stock, including our common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock, unless we have declared and paid full dividends on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 26\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Among the factors that may affect our stock price are the following:\n\u2022\nSpeculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, ability to maximize shareholder returns or plans to engage in strategic transactions by us or others in the financial services industry\n\u2022\nThe announcement of mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or new products or services by us or others in the financial services industry\n\u2022\nIncreases or decreases in revenues or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results\n\u2022\nThe pricing structure for products and services offered to customers by us or our competitors\nGeneral stock market volatility or volatility related to our industry may also affect our stock price. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. We have been a party to litigation related to the decline in the market price of our stock in the past and such litigation could occur again in the future. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key employees, reduce our access to capital and otherwise harm our business.\nWe have provisions in our organizational documents that may discourage takeover attempts.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a stockholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include:\n\u2022\nAuthorization for the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock\n\u2022\nThe prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors\n\u2022\nA super-majority voting requirement to effect business combinations and certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws\n\u2022\nLimits on the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders\n\u2022\nThe prohibition of stockholder action by written consent\n\u2022\nAdvance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings\nIn addition, certain provisions of our stock incentive plans, management retention and employment agreements, including severance payments and stock option acceleration, our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, certain provisions of Delaware law and certain provisions of the indentures governing certain series of our debt securities that would require us to offer to purchase such securities at a premium in the event of certain changes in our ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nE*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 27", "PERMNO": 83862, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "ETFC"}
