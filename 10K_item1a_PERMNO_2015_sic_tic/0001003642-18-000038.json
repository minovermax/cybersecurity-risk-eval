{"cik": "1003642", "company": "IMPAX LABORATORIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur operating results and financial condition could fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding year or quarter of the preceding year, as the case may be, for a number of reasons, including all the risks described in this section. We also cannot predict with any certainty the timing or level of sales of our products in the future. Our operating results and profitability are also dependent upon the costs for us to purchase products from third parties and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner. If we are unable to reduce our operating expenses to offset a decline in revenue of our products for a particular fiscal period due to existing or new competition, product supply or any other reasons, we could experience a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in such periods.\nDue to the fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance and any full-year financial forecast should not be relied upon as a guarantee of future performance for that year or for any given quarter within that year. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the value of our securities could decline substantially and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, as further described below under the risk factor, \u201cThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and the value of any investment in our common stock could decline significantly.\u201d\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and the value of any investment in our common stock could decline significantly.\nThe market price for our shares of common stock listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market has fluctuated significantly from time to time, for example, varying between a high of $25.70 on September 21, 2017 to a low of $7.75 on March 7, 2017 during the year ended December 31, 2017. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market, industry and other factors, including the risks described in this section. Further, the stock market for pharmaceutical companies has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, recent negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the market for pharmaceutical companies. These broad market and industry factors have negatively impacted, and in the future may seriously negatively impact, the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nOur stock market price may also be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business. If our results do not meet these analysts\u2019 forecasts, the expectations of our investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, the market price of our common stock could decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market or significant price decline, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies and we have in the past been subject to such suits. Such suits could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur continued growth is dependent on our ability to continue to successfully develop and commercialize new products in a timely manner.\nOur financial results depend upon our ability to introduce and commercialize additional generic and branded products in a timely manner. As of December 31, 2017, we had 17 product applications pending at the FDA and 20 product candidates under development for generic versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals. In our branded products division, we have a few product candidates in various stages of development, including IPX203, a new extended-release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa and levodopa, as a potential treatment for symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nThe future profitability of our Impax Generics Division depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to introduce, on a timely basis, new generic products that are either the first-to-market (or among the first-to-market) or that otherwise can gain significant share during the 180-day marketing period as permitted by the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide for a period of 180 days of marketing exclusivity for a generic version of a previously approved drug for any applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to the corresponding brand-name drug (commonly referred to as a \u201cParagraph IV certification\u201d). ANDAs that contain Paragraph IV certifications challenging patents, however, generally become the subject of patent litigation that can be both lengthy and costly. We cannot assure that we will prevail in any such patent litigation, that we will be the first-to-file and be granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, or, if we are granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, that we will not forfeit such period. Even in the event where our ANDA is awarded marketing exclusivity, we may be required to share our exclusivity period with other ANDA applicants who submit Paragraph IV certifications. Further, branded pharmaceutical companies often authorize a generic version of the corresponding brand name drug to be sold during any period of marketing exclusivity that is awarded. Furthermore, timely commencement of the litigation by the patent owner imposes an automatic stay of ANDA approval by the FDA for 30 months, unless the case is decided in the ANDA applicant\u2019s favor during that period. Finally, if the court decision is adverse to the ANDA applicant, the ANDA approval will be delayed until the challenged patent expires, and the applicant will not be granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity. Our ability to timely bring our products to market is thus dependent upon, among other things, the timing of regulatory approval of our products, which to a large extent is outside of our control, as well as the timing of competing products. Our revenues and future profitability are also dependent, in large part, upon our ability or the ability of our development partners to file, timely and effectively, ANDAs with the FDA or to enter into collaboration agreements or other contractual relationships with third parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity.\nThe development and commercialization process for our branded products in the Impax Specialty Pharma Division is time-consuming, costly and involves processes and expertise that are different from those used in the development of our generic products, thus creating a higher degree of risk of failure. For example, the time from discovery to commercial launch of a branded specialty product can be 15 years or even longer, and involves multiple stages from intensive preclinical and clinical testing to a highly complex, lengthy and expensive approval process with the FDA. The longer it takes to develop a product, the less time there will be for us to recover our development costs and generate profits. The FDA and the regulatory authorities may not approve our products submitted to them or our other products under development. Additionally, we may not successfully complete our development efforts. Even if the FDA approves our products, we may not be able to market them successfully or profitably or our future results of operations will depend significantly upon our ability to timely develop, receive FDA approval for, and market new pharmaceutical products or otherwise acquire new products.\nNo assurances can be given that we will be able to develop and introduce commercially successful products in the future within the time constraints necessary to be successful. If we or our development partners are unable to continue to timely and effectively file ANDAs with the FDA or to partner with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity or if we are unable to timely develop and receive approval of our branded pipeline products, our revenues and operating results may decline significantly and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition from both brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing, and other resources than we have. Further, the pharmaceutical industry has in recent years seen increased consolidation, resulting in larger competitors and placing further pressure on prices, development activities and customer retention. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 customer base consists of an increasingly limited number of large pharmaceutical wholesalers, chain drug stores that warehouse products, mass merchandisers and mail order pharmacies. Our competitors may be able to develop products competitive with or more effective or less expensive than our own for many reasons, including that they may have:\n\u2022\nproprietary processes or delivery systems;\n\u2022\ngreater resources in the area of research and development and marketing;\n\u2022\nlarger or more efficient production capabilities;\n\u2022\nmore expertise in a particular therapeutic area;\n\u2022\nmore expertise in preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u2022\nmore experience in obtaining required regulatory approvals, including FDA approval;\n\u2022\nmore breadth of products; or\n\u2022\nmore experience in developing new drugs and financial resources, particularly with regard to brand manufacturers.\nIn the generic products market, we face competition from other generic pharmaceutical companies, which may impact our selling price and revenues from such products. The FDA approval process often results in the FDA granting final approval to a number of ANDAs for a given product at the time a patent for a corresponding brand product or other market exclusivity expires. This often forces us to face immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into the market. As competition from other generic pharmaceutical companies intensifies, selling prices and gross profit margins often decline, which has been our experience with our existing products. Moreover, with respect to products for which we file a Paragraph IV certification, if we are not the first ANDA filer challenging a listed patent for a product, we are at a significant disadvantage to the competitor that first filed an ANDA for that product containing such a challenge, which is awarded 180 days of market exclusivity for the product. Conversely, in some cases when we are the first ANDA filer to challenge a listed patent, we may forfeit our 180 days of market exclusivity under certain circumstances. In that case, a competitor may obtain ANDA approval earlier than we obtain ANDA approval, in which case we will be at a disadvantage to such competitor. Accordingly, the level of market share, revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product that we develop is generally related to the number of competitors in that product\u2019s market and the timing of that product\u2019s regulatory approval and launch, in relation to competing approvals and launches. Although we cannot assure, we strive to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to be competitive in our industry (see \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d). Additionally, ANDA approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the initial launch of the generic product. These circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices and reduced margins for generic products compared to brand products. New generic market entrants generally cause continued price and margin erosion over the generic product life cycle.\nIn addition to the competition we face from other generic pharmaceutical companies related to our generic products, we also face competition from brand-name pharmaceutical companies that may try to prevent, discourage or delay the use of generic versions through various measures, including introduction of new branded products, legislative initiatives, changing dosage forms or dosing regimens, regulatory processes, filing new patents or patent extensions, lawsuits, citizens\u2019 petitions, and negative publicity prior to introduction of a generic product. In addition, brand-name competitors may lower their prices to compete with generic products, increase advertising, or launch, either through an affiliate or licensing arrangements with another company, an authorized generic at or near the time the first generic product is launched, reducing the generic product market exclusivity provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act.\nOur principal competitors in the generic pharmaceutical products market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mylan N.V., Cipla, Inc, Lannett Company, Inc., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Sandoz.\nIn the brand-name pharmaceutical market, our principal competitors are pharmaceutical companies that are focused on Parkinson\u2019s disease and other CNS disorders, many of whom have substantially greater resources and longer operating histories and experience with the development, marketing and/or acquisition of branded products. Such companies have greater resources to devote to the marketing of new products and as such, we face increased pressure to demonstrate to our physicians, patients and third party payors the benefits of our branded products compared to competing or comparable products, whose benefits may be more familiar or better established. Further, our branded products also face competition from generic companies who may develop and receive approval on generic versions of our products, resulting in decreased selling price and reduced revenue from the sale of such products. For instance, we have filed suits against Actavis Laboratories, Inc., Sandoz Inc. and Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA relating to their respective ANDAs for carbidopa and levodopa extended release capsules, generic to Rytary\u00ae (see \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Legal and Regulatory Matters\u201d for a description of the suits). If such litigation is resolved unfavorably for us such that we are unable to rely on our patent protection for Rytary\u00ae as a barrier to entry of potential generic versions of the product, we may experience significant decreased revenue from sales of Rytary\u00ae which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nManufacturing or quality control problems may damage our reputation for quality production, demand costly remedial activities and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a pharmaceutical company, we are subject to substantial regulation by various governmental authorities. For instance, we must comply with requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and other healthcare regulators with respect to the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, promotion and development of pharmaceutical products. We must register our facilities, whether located in the United States or elsewhere, with the FDA as well as regulators outside the United States, and our products must be made in a manner consistent with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d), or similar standards in each territory in which we manufacture. The failure of one of our facilities, or a facility of one of our third party suppliers, to comply with applicable laws and regulations may lead to breach of representations made to our customers or to regulatory or government action against us related to products made in that facility.\nIn addition, the FDA and other agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities. Following an inspection, an agency may issue a notice listing conditions that are believed to violate cGMP or other regulations, or a warning letter for violations of \u201cregulatory significance\u201d that may result in enforcement action if not promptly and adequately corrected. We have in the past received a warning letter from the FDA regarding certain operations within our manufacturing network at our Hayward manufacturing facility, which we subsequently resolved in 2015. We remain committed to continuing to improve our quality control and manufacturing practices; however, we cannot be assured that the FDA will continue to be satisfied with our corrective actions and with our quality control and manufacturing systems and standards. Failure to comply strictly with these regulations and requirements may damage our reputation and lead to financial penalties, compliance expenditures, the recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, withdrawal or suspension of the applicable regulator\u2019s review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Further, other federal agencies, our customers and partners in our alliance, development, collaboration and other partnership agreements with respect to our products and services may take any such FDA observations or warning letters into account when considering the award of contracts or the continuation or extension of such partnership agreements. Because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific, the delay and cost of remedial actions, or obtaining approval to manufacture at a different facility, could negatively impact our business. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and/or any actions by the FDA and other agencies as described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our business will suffer.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in the past several years, including through acquisitions such as the Teva Transaction in 2016, and we anticipate continued rapid expansion in the future, including through our proposed business combination with Amneal as described above under \u201cItem 1. Business - Business Combination with Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC\u201d. This growth has required us to expand, upgrade, and improve our administrative, operational, and management systems, internal controls and resources. Although we cannot assure you that we will, in fact, grow as we expect, if we fail to manage growth effectively or to develop a successful marketing approach, our business and financial results will be materially harmed. We may also seek to expand our business through complementary or strategic acquisitions of other businesses, products or assets, or through joint ventures, strategic agreements or other arrangements. Any such acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations may involve significant integration challenges, operational complexities and time consumption and require substantial resources and effort. It may also disrupt our ongoing businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with customers, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. Further, if we are unable to realize synergies or other benefits expected to result from any acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations, or to generate additional revenue to offset any unanticipated inability to realize these expected synergies or benefits, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired, which would require us to focus additional resources on the integration of operations rather than other profitable areas of our business, and may otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may make acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary technologies, businesses or products, which may be on terms that are not commercially advantageous, may require additional debt or equity financing, and may involve numerous risks, including the risks that we may be unable to integrate the acquired business successfully and that we may assume liabilities that adversely affect us.\nWe regularly review the potential acquisition of technologies, products, product rights and complementary businesses. We may choose to enter into such transactions at any time. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates. To the extent that we do identify candidates that we believe to be suitable, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially advantageous terms or at all. Further, there are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to closing such transactions. If such transactions are not completed for any reason, we will be subject to several risks, including the following: (i) the market price of shares of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a failure to complete such transactions could result in a negative perception by the market of us generally and a decline in the market price of our common stock; and (ii) many costs relating to the such transactions may be payable by us whether or not such transactions are completed.\nIf we make any acquisitions or investments, we may finance such acquisitions or investments through our cash reserves, debt financing, or by issuing additional equity securities, which could dilute the holdings of our then-existing stockholders. If we require financing, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain required financing when needed on acceptable terms or at all. Any such acquisitions or investments could also result in an increase in goodwill, intangible assets and amortization expenses that could ultimately negatively impact our profitability. As further described below under the risk factor \u201cOur significant balances of intangible assets, including product rights and goodwill acquired, are subject to impairment testing,\u201d if the fair value of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined at some future date to be less than its recorded value, a charge to earnings may be required. Further, our consolidated financial statements may also be impacted in future periods based on the accuracy of our valuations of any businesses or assets we acquire. Such a charge to earnings or impact on our consolidated financial statements could be in amounts that are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in assimilating the personnel, operations and products of the acquired companies, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. There may be overlap between our products or customers and those of an acquired entity that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of acquired companies with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of acquiring businesses, we may incur significant transaction costs, including substantial fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and financial printing. Any acquisition could result in our assumption of unknown and/or unexpected, perhaps material liabilities. Additionally, in any acquisition agreement, the negotiated representations, warranties and agreements of the selling parties may not entirely protect us, and liabilities resulting from any breaches could exceed negotiated indemnity limitations.\nOur significant balances of intangible assets, including product rights and goodwill acquired, are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges. Impairment charges, and the factors contributing to the incurrence of such impairment charges, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nA significant amount of our total assets is related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our goodwill, which includes goodwill generated as a result of the Tower Acquisition, in addition to goodwill generated as a result of the December 1999 merger of Global Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was $207.3 million, or approximately 15% of our total assets. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, composed of currently marketed product rights, in-process research and development product rights, and future royalties was $262.5 million, or approximately 19% of our total assets.\nWe have in recent years seen significant balances of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. For instance, the carrying value of our intangible assets was $262.5 million and $620.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We regularly evaluate and will continue to regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred to indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of intangible assets or goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary. As part of our regular evaluation, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\nWe may never fully realize the value of our intangibles assets and goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet, and we have in recent years incurred a significant amount of intangible asset impairment charges as a result of our recent acquisitions, such as the Teva Transaction. For instance, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a total of $289.7 million of intangible asset impairment charges, with a significant portion of such charges attributable to products acquired in the Teva Transaction as a result of manufacturing issues, product launch delays, increased competition or significant price or volume erosion without an offsetting increase in customer demand.\nThere was no impairment charge related to goodwill as a result of our annual testing in 2017.\nAny future acquisitions or investments in businesses could also result in an increase in goodwill, intangible assets and amortization expenses that could have a negative impact on our profitability. If the fair value of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined at some future date to be less than its recorded value, a charge to earnings may be required. Any such charge or future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets, and the factors leading to the incurrence of such charges or write-off, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our total revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a limited number of customers. In 2017, our three major customers, Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation, and Amerisource-Bergen, accounted for 33%, 30%, and 25%, respectively, or an aggregate of 88%, of our gross revenue.\nOur net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of our customers, whether resulting from pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. Since such a significant portion of our revenues is derived from relatively few customers, any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer, any delay in receiving payments from a single customer, or any reduction or loss of business with one of these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our total revenues is derived from sales of a limited number of products.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of a limited number of products. In 2017, our significant products accounted for 15%, 12%, 9%, 7% and 7%, or an aggregate of 50%, of our product sales, net. The sale of our products can be significantly influenced by market conditions, as well as regulatory actions. We may experience decreases in the sale of our products in the future as a result of actions taken by our competitors, such as price reductions, or as a result of regulatory actions related to our products or to competing products, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. Actions which could be taken by our competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, may include, without limitation, pricing changes and entering or exiting the market for specific products.\nSales volume and prices of our products may be adversely affected by the continuing trend of consolidation of certain customer groups, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant proportion of our sales is made to relatively few retail drug chains, wholesalers, and managed care organizations. These customers are continuing to undergo significant consolidation. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products. For example, there has been a recent trend of large wholesalers and retailer customers forming partnerships, such as the alliance between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, the alliance between Rite Aid and McKesson Drug Company, and the alliance between CVS Caremark and Cardinal Health. Increased pricing pressure and other adverse effects from the continued consolidation of our customers and the creation of partnerships between wholesalers and retailer customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in the past, and our future profitability is uncertain.\nWe experienced net losses during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and cannot assure that our business will return to profitability or generate positive cash flow in the future. To remain operational and profitable, we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nobtain FDA approval of our products;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully launch and market new products;\n\u2022\nprevail in patent infringement litigation in which we are involved;\n\u2022\ncontinue to generate or obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms to fund our operations; and\n\u2022\ncomply with the many complex governmental regulations that deal with virtually every aspect of our business activities.\nWe have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could reduce our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to realize deferred tax assets may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Deferred tax assets are recorded for net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities expected to produce tax deductions in future periods. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred tax assets would be deductible. We assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset. For instance, when we experienced an operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets we subsequently recorded a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 for the reasons outlined below. We incurred operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 largely due in part to impairment charges we incurred during each of the years. As part of our evaluations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, we weighed both the positive and negative evidence available, such as scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, prior earnings history, projected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence may be objectively verified. As such, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences and carryforwards to outweigh objective negative evidence of financial reporting losses. In addition, due to the elimination of the net operating loss carryback pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Reform Act\"), we excluded 2016 taxable income as a source of taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset. Based on an evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence available we determined that it was necessary to continue to record a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets that we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well. The valuation allowance reduces earnings and our shareholders\u2019 equity and increases the balance sheet leverage as measured by debt-to-total capitalization. The valuation allowance will remain until such time, if ever, that we can determine that the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, and the indenture governing our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due June 2022 impose financial and operating restrictions on us.\nWe have a $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $400.0 million term loan (the \"Term Loan Facility\", and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the \"RBC Credit Facilities\") pursuant to an amended credit agreement, dated as of August 3, 2016, by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent and collateral agent. We are also party to an indenture dated June 30, 2015 between us and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) governing our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). Refer to \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 10. Debt\u201d for a detailed description of our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur RBC Credit Facilities and Indenture contain a number of negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities. These covenants limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt, guarantee other obligations or grant liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans or investments;\n\u2022\nundertake certain acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake optional payments or modify certain debt instruments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or other payments on our capital stock, enter into arrangements that restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or grant liens; or\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with our affiliates.\nThe terms of our RBC Credit Facilities also include a financial covenant which requires us to maintain a certain total net leverage ratio. These limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests. If we breach any of the covenants in our RBC Credit Facilities or Indenture, we may be in default and our borrowings under the facilities and the Notes could be declared due and payable, including accrued interest and other fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur level of indebtedness and liabilities could limit cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our convertible notes and other debt instruments.\nAt December 31, 2017, our total consolidated liabilities were $1.2 billion, including $600.0 million of outstanding convertible notes and a $325.0 million term loan. Refer to \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 10. Debt\u201d for a detailed description of our outstanding indebtedness. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\ndilution experienced by our existing stockholders as a result of the conversion of the convertible notes into shares of common stock; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain sufficient cash reserves or continue to generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or that our cash needs will not increase. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness then outstanding, we would be in default, which would permit the holders of the affected indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness. Any default under any indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. If we issue equity, convertible preferred equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses and potentially lowering our credit ratings. We may not be able to market such issuances on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.\nAny delays or unanticipated expenses in connection with the operation of our facility or at one of our third party suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we closed our Middlesex, New Jersey manufacturing facility and announced that we have entered into a stock and purchase agreement with a third party pursuant to which we subsequently sold Impax Laboratories (Taiwan) Inc. (\"Impax Taiwan\"), our wholly owned subsidiary which owns our manufacturing facility in Taiwan, R.O.C.; the sale subsequently closed in February 2018. Refer to \"Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 15. Restructurings.\" As such, we are increasingly dependent on our manufacturing facility located in Hayward, California and on our third party suppliers to manufacture our products. A significant disruption at our Hayward facility or at any of our third party suppliers, even on a short-term basis, whether due to an adverse quality or compliance observation, including a total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution by regulatory authorities, an act of God, terrorism, civil or political unrest, or other events could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis and could, among other consequences, subject us to exposure to claims from customers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the economic, political, legal and other risks of maintaining facilities and conducting clinical trials in foreign countries.\nWe conduct certain operations in foreign countries, primarily related to clinical trials for our product candidates at various sites in Europe. These foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in maintaining operations and doing business abroad, such as economic and political destabilization, international conflicts, restrictive actions by foreign governments, expropriation or nationalization of property, changes in laws and regulations, changes in regulatory requirements, the difficulty of effectively managing diverse global operations, adverse foreign tax or tariff laws, more limited intellectual property protection in certain foreign jurisdictions, and the threat posed by potential international disease pandemics in countries that do not have the resources necessary to deal with such outbreaks. Further, as our global operations require compliance with a complex set of foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and local laws which also prohibit payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. These foreign economic, political, legal and other risks could impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation that can delay or prevent our commercialization of generic products or accelerate generic competition for our branded products, all of which are uncertain, force us to incur substantial expense to defend and/or expose us to substantial liability.\nPatent infringement litigation involves many complex technical and legal issues and its outcome is often difficult to predict, and the risk involved in doing so can be substantial. For generic product manufacturers, the potential consequences to such generic companies in the event of an unfavorable outcome include delaying generic launch until patent expiration and potential damages measured by the profits lost by the branded product manufacturer rather than the profits earned by the generic pharmaceutical company. For brand drug manufacturers, an unfavorable outcome may significantly accelerate generic competition ahead of patent expiration. Such litigation usually involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our products. Our generic products division is routinely subject to patent infringement litigation brought by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers seeking to delay FDA approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products. Likewise, our branded products division is currently involved in patent infringement litigation against generic drug manufacturers seeking FDA approval to market their generic drugs prior to expiration of patents covering our branded products.\nWe and/or our third party partners are routinely subject to patent infringement suits related to our Generics Division products, including as of December 31, 2017, suits related to our oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, apixaban tablets and dimethyl furarate capsules. If this or any of our future patent litigation matters involving generic products are resolved unfavorably, we or our alliance or collaboration partners may be enjoined from manufacturing, developing or selling the generic product that is the subject of such litigation without a license from the other party. In addition, if we decide to market and sell generic products prior to the resolution of patent infringement suits, we could be held liable for lost profits if we are found to have infringed a valid patent, or liable for treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a valid patent. In our branded products division, as of December 31, 2017, we were involved in two patent infringement suits related to Zomig\u00ae nasal spray and three patent infringement suits related to Rytary\u00ae. If these patent litigation matters involving our branded products are resolved unfavorably, our Zomig\u00ae nasal spray product and/or Rytary\u00ae may face generic competition significantly earlier than the date of patent expirations for the products. We have incurred substantial expense to defend the foregoing patent litigation suits; during fiscal year 2017, we incurred costs of $5.1 million in connection with our participation in the patent litigation matters described above, as well as for other matters that were resolved in 2017. Although it is not currently possible to quantify the liability we could incur if any of the above referenced patent litigation suits are decided against us, any unfavorable outcome on such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to patent infringement litigation claims, we are or may become a party to other litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, other intellectual property rights infringement, violations of securities laws, employment discrimination or breach of commercial contract. A detailed description of our significant legal proceedings are described in \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Legal and Regulatory Matters.\u201d In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur agreements to settle patent litigations, which are important to our business, are facing increased government scrutiny in the United States, which may result in increased government actions and private litigation suits.\nWe are involved in numerous patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies\u2019 listed patents and/or their applicability to our generic pharmaceutical products, as well as patent infringement litigation in which generic companies challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and/or their applicability to their generic pharmaceutical products, and therefore settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be an important part of our business. Parties to such settlement agreements in the United States, including us, are required by law to file them with the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, some of the brand - generic settlement agreements violate the antitrust laws and has brought actions against some brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court in its decision in FTC v. Actavis determined that \u201creverse payment\u201d settlement agreements between brand and generic companies could violate antitrust laws. The Supreme Court held that such settlement agreements are neither immune from antitrust attack nor presumptively illegal but rather should be analyzed under the \u201cRule of Reason.\u201d It is currently uncertain the effect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will have on our existing settlement agreements or its impact on our ability to enter into such settlement agreements in the future or the terms thereof. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision may result in heightened scrutiny from the FTC of such settlement agreements and we may become subject to increased FTC investigations or enforcement actions arising from such settlement agreements. Further, private plaintiffs, including direct and indirect purchasers of our products, may also become more active in bringing private litigation claims against us and other brand and generic pharmaceutical companies alleging that such settlement agreements violate antitrust laws.\nOur approved products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new products, the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative products from our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe prices of our products relative to those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our market entry;\n\u2022\nthe ability to market our products effectively at the retail level;\n\u2022\nthe perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payors, regarding the safety, efficacy and benefits of our drug products compared to those of competing products; and\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of our products by government and private formularies.\nSome of these factors are not within our control, and our products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance. Additionally, continuing and increasingly sophisticated studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others which can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of product marketing or other risk management programs such as the need for a patient registry.\nOur business is highly dependent on market perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. Our business, products or product pricing could be subject to negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket perceptions of our business are very important to us, especially market perceptions of the safety and quality of our products. If any of our products or similar products that other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, because our business is dependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality, illness or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe generic pharmaceutical industry has also in recent years been the subject of significant publicity regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products more generally, including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by competitors and peer companies for new products as well as price increases by competitors and peer companies on older products that the public has deemed excessive. Any downward pricing pressure on the price of certain of our products arising from social or political pressure to lower the cost of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAccompanying the press and media coverage of pharmaceutical pricing practices and public complaints about the same, there has been increasing U.S. federal and state legislative and enforcement interest with respect to drug pricing. For instance, the United States Department of Justice issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies, including us, seeking information about the sales, marketing and pricing of certain generic drugs. A detailed description of the United States Department of Justice\u2019s investigation is described in \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Legal and Regulatory Matters\u201d. In addition to the effects of any investigations or claims brought against us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected if any such inquiries, of us or of other pharmaceutical companies or the industry more generally, were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.\nWe may discontinue the manufacture and distribution of certain existing products, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually evaluate the performance of our products, and may determine that it is in our best interest to discontinue the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. We cannot guarantee that we have correctly forecasted, or will correctly forecast in the future, the appropriate products to discontinue or that our decision to discontinue various products is prudent if market conditions change. In addition, we cannot assure you that the discontinuance of products will reduce our operating expenses or will not cause us to incur material charges associated with such a decision. Furthermore, the discontinuance of existing products entails various risks, including, in the event that we decide to sell the discontinued product, the risk that we will not be able to find a purchaser for such products or that the purchase price obtained will not be equal to at least the book value of the net assets for such products. Other risks include managing the expectations of, and maintaining good relations with, our customers who previously purchased products from our discontinued products, which could prevent us from selling other products to them in the future. Moreover, we may incur other significant liabilities and costs associated with our discontinuance of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts that may not lead to successful product introductions or the recovery of our research and development expenditures.\nWe conduct research and development primarily to enable us to manufacture and market pharmaceuticals in accordance with FDA regulations. We spent $80.8 million, $80.5 million and $70.6 million on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We are required to obtain FDA approval before marketing our drug products. The FDA approval process is costly and time consuming. Typically, research expenses related to the development of innovative products and the filing of NDAs are significantly greater than those expenses associated with ANDAs. As we continue to develop new products, our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in our industry, our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.\nOur bioequivalence studies, other clinical studies and/or other data may not result in FDA approval to market our new drug products. While we believe that the FDA\u2019s ANDA procedures will apply to our bioequivalent versions of branded drugs, these drugs may not be suitable for, or approved as part of, these abbreviated applications. In addition, even if our drug products are suitable for FDA approval by filing an ANDA, the abbreviated applications are costly and time consuming to complete. After we submit a NDA or ANDA, the FDA may require that we conduct additional studies, and as a result, we may be unable to reasonably determine the total research and development costs to develop a particular product. Also, for products pending approval, we may obtain raw materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in anticipation of the product\u2019s launch. In the event that FDA approval is denied or delayed, we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete. Finally, we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products or product-delivery technologies will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on research and development efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new products or new delivery technologies as a result of those efforts, we will be unable to recover those expenditures.\nThe time necessary to develop generic drugs may adversely affect whether, and the extent to which, we receive a return on our capital.\nWe generally begin our development activities for a new generic drug product several years in advance of the patent expiration date of the brand-name drug equivalent. The development process, including drug formulation, testing, and FDA review and approval, often takes three or more years. This process requires that we expend considerable capital to pursue activities that do not yield an immediate or near-term return. Also, because of the significant time necessary to develop a product, the actual market for a product at the time it is available for sale may be significantly less than the originally projected market for the product. If this were to occur, our potential return on our investment in developing the product, if approved for marketing by the FDA, would be adversely affected and we may never receive a return on our investment in the product. It is also possible for the manufacturer of the brand-name product for which we are developing a generic drug to obtain approvals from the FDA to switch the brand-name drug from the prescription market to the OTC market. If this were to occur, we would be prohibited from marketing our product other than as an OTC drug, in which case revenues could be substantially less than we anticipated.\nResearch and development efforts invested in our branded pharmaceutical products may not achieve expected results.\nWe invest increasingly significant resources to develop our branded products, both through our own efforts and through collaborations, in-licensing and acquisition of products from or with third parties. The development of proprietary branded drugs involves processes and expertise different from those used in the development of generic products, which increases the risks of failure that we face. For example, the time from discovery to commercial launch of a branded product can be 15 years or even longer, and involves multiple stages: not only intensive preclinical and clinical testing, but also highly complex, lengthy and expensive approval processes which can vary from country to country. The longer it takes to develop a product, the longer time it may take for us to recover our development costs and generate profits, if at all.\nDuring each development stage, we may encounter obstacles that delay the process or approval and increase expenses, leading to significant risks that we will not achieve our goals and may be forced to abandon a potential product in which we have invested substantial amounts of time and money. These obstacles may include: preclinical failures; difficulty enrolling patients in clinical trials; delays in completing formulation and other work needed to support an application for approval; adverse reactions or other safety concerns arising during clinical testing; insufficient clinical trial data to support the safety or efficacy of the product candidate; and failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the facilities in which it is manufactured. As a result of the obstacles noted above, our investment in research and development of branded products can involve significant costs with no assurances of future revenues or profits.\nApprovals for our new generic drug products may be delayed or become more difficult to obtain if the FDA institutes changes to its approval requirements.\nThe FDA may institute changes to its ANDA approval requirements, such as implementing new or additional fees similar to the fees imposed by the Generic Drug Fee User Amendments of 2012 (\u201cGDUFA\u201d) and its second iteration (GDUFA II), which may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain approval for our new generic products. The FDA may also implement other changes that may directly affect some of our ANDA filings pending approval from the FDA, such as changes to guidance from the FDA regarding bioequivalency requirements for particular drugs. Such changes may cause our development of such generic drugs to be significantly more difficult or result in delays in FDA approval or result in our decision to abandon or terminate certain projects. Any changes in FDA requirements may make it more difficult for us to file ANDAs or obtain approval of our ANDAs and generate revenues and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting clinical trials could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our own branded products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to our branded products which do not qualify for the FDA\u2019s abbreviated application procedures, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that these products are safe and effective for use. We have only limited experience in conducting and supervising clinical trials. The process of completing clinical trials and preparing a NDA may take several years and requires substantial resources. Our studies and filings may not result in FDA approval to market our new drug products and, if the FDA grants approval, we cannot predict the timing of any approval. There are substantial filing fees for NDAs that are not refundable if FDA approval is not obtained.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with clinical trials. The results of clinical trials may not be indicative of results that would be obtained from large scale testing. Clinical trials are often conducted with patients having advanced stages of disease and, as a result, during the course of treatment these patients can die or suffer adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agents being tested, but which nevertheless affect the clinical trial results. In addition, side effects experienced by the patients may cause delay of approval or limit the profile of an approved product. Moreover, our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve certain products developed by us, there is no assurance that such regulatory authorities will not subject marketing of such products to certain limits on indicated use.\nFailure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process and, in addition, the results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later and larger clinical trials, and product candidates in later clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety or efficacy despite having progressed successfully through earlier clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even in advanced clinical trials after showing positive results in earlier clinical trials. The completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed or halted for the reasons noted above in addition to many other reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in patient enrollment, and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not allow us to commence or continue a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nour inability, or the inability of our partners, to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient to complete our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with trial design, which may result in a failure of the trial to show statistically significant results even if the product candidate is effective;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment commences, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u2022\npoor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsafety issues, including adverse events associated with product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe failure of patients to complete clinical trials due to adverse side effects, dissatisfaction with the product candidate, or other reasons;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory delays or changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines; and\n\u2022\nvarying interpretation of data by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, our product candidates could be subject to competition for clinical study sites and patients from other therapies under development which may delay the enrollment in or initiation of our clinical trials.\nThe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct unanticipated additional clinical trials, which could result in additional expense and delays in bringing our product candidates to market. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates would prevent or delay the commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot assure that our expenses related to clinical trials will lead to the development of brand-name drugs that will generate revenues in the near future. Delays or failure in the development and commercialization of our own branded products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials and testing for our product candidates, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their legal and regulatory obligations, as well as their contractual obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe design the clinical trials for our product candidates, but rely on contract research organizations and other third parties to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out these trials, including with respect to site selection, contract negotiation, analytical testing and data management. We do not control these third parties and, as a result, they may not treat our clinical studies as their highest priority, or in the manner in which we would prefer, which could result in delays.\nAlthough we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and related activities, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices and good laboratory practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. The FDA enforces good clinical practices and good laboratory practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we, our contract research organizations or our study sites fail to comply with applicable good clinical practices and good laboratory practices, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with good clinical practices and good laboratory practices. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product manufactured under the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers if any are involved in the process, to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements with us, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements. If our clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently do not have a license partner for commercialization of Numient\u00ae outside of the United States and Taiwan.\nIn November 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Numient\u00ae (IPX066) (referred to as Rytary\u00ae in the United States). The review of the Numient\u00ae application was conducted under the centralized licensing procedure as a therapeutic innovation, and the authorization is applicable in all 28 member states of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. We have no experience marketing or selling our pharmaceutical products outside of the United States and Puerto Rico and to date, we have not launched commercialization activities for Numient\u00ae outside of the United States. In connection with our sale of Impax Taiwan in February 2018, we entered into a license agreement for the third party buyer to manufacture and commercialize Numient\u00ae in Taiwan, R.O.C., for a period of up to ten years. If we are unsuccessful in entering into third party collaboration arrangements for commercialization activities of Numient\u00ae outside of the United States or Taiwan , R.O.C., such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties could illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or no active pharmaceutical ingredients at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nReports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nPublic loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials that we use to manufacture our products and interruptions in our supply chain could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe raw materials we use in the production of our products consist of pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms that are generally available from several sources in the United States and throughout the world. In some cases, however, the raw materials, such as the active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d) used to manufacture our products, are available only from a single supplier. Further, even if more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and have done so in the case of our API suppliers for a majority of our products, to list only one supplier in our product applications submitted to the FDA. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier or the supplier was not in compliance with FDA or other applicable requirements, the FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved. As a result, there is no guarantee we will always have timely and sufficient access to a required raw material or other product. Generally, we would need as long as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year\u2019s termination notice from a sole-source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. We currently do not have long-term supply agreements with the majority of our API suppliers and although to date we have only experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive uninterrupted or adequate supplies of such raw materials.\nA significant portion of our raw materials may also be available only from foreign sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\ngreater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems;\n\u2022\nthe relative instability of some foreign governments and economies;\n\u2022\ninterim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights.\nMany third-party suppliers are subject to governmental regulation and, accordingly, we are dependent on the regulatory compliance of these third parties. We also depend on the strength, enforceability and terms of our various contracts with these third-party suppliers. We also rely on complex shipping arrangements throughout the various facilities of our supply chain spectrum. Customs clearance and shipping by land, air or sea routes rely on and may be affected by factors that are not in our full control or are hard to predict.\nAny inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, or any significant price increases which cannot be passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur policies regarding returns, rebates, allowances and chargebacks, and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods.\nBased on industry practice, many generic drug manufacturers\u2019 policies give customers post-sale inventory allowances on returns. Under these arrangements, from time to time, we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing. Therefore, if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products, we would likely reduce the price of our product. As a result, we would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products, which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided. Like our competitors, we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies or other customers. A chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler\u2019s end-customer, who is covered under a contract with the manufacturer allowing it to purchase at a lower price, pays for a product. Although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods, we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns, rebates, allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates. Any failure to establish adequate reserves with respect to returns, rebates, allowances and chargebacks may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our products use controlled substances, the availability of which may be limited by the DEA and other regulatory agencies.\nWe utilize controlled substances in certain of our current products and products in development and therefore must meet the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the related regulations administered by the DEA in the United States. These laws relate to the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of controlled substances. The DEA and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the active ingredients used in certain of our current products and products in development and, as a result, our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. We must annually apply to the DEA for procurement quota in order to obtain these substances. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our procurement quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough global economic conditions have been fairly stable as a whole in recent years, continued concerns regarding the systemic impact of potential geopolitical issues and economic policy uncertainty could potentially cause economic and market instability in the future and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including our partners under our alliance and collaboration agreements, suppliers of raw chemical materials, drug wholesalers and other customers that may be affected by an unstable economic environment. Any economic instability or challenging economic conditions could result in tighter credit conditions and thus affect these parties\u2019 ability to fulfill their respective contractual obligations to us, cause them to limit or place burdensome conditions upon future transactions with us or drive us and our competitors to decrease prices, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures, including through cyber-attacks or other third party breaches, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information.\nFurther, data maintained in digital form is subject to risk of cyber-attacks, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Despite our efforts to monitor and safeguard our systems to prevent data compromise, the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering, and theft remain. In addition, we do not have insurance coverage with respect to system failures or cyber-attacks.\nWhile we have implemented a number of protective measures, including firewalls, antivirus, patches, data encryption, log monitors, routine back-ups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning, routine password modifications and disaster recovery procedures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events. If our systems were to fail or we are unable to successfully expand the capacity of these systems, or we are unable to integrate new technologies into our existing systems, our operations and financial results could suffer.\nWe have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we depend on third parties who are responsible for maintaining significant elements of our information technology systems and infrastructure and who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of our third party vendors, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by its employees, partners or vendors. These systems are also vulnerable to attacks by malicious third parties, and may be susceptible to intentional or accidental physical damage to the infrastructure maintained by us or by third parties. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology or information, and/or adversely affect our business. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by alliance, collaboration, supply, or license and distribution agreements we enter into with other companies.\nWe have entered into several alliance, collaboration, supply or license and distribution agreements with respect to certain of our products and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future. These arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us. Relationships with alliance partners may also include risks due to regulatory requirements, incomplete marketplace information, inventories, and commercial strategies of our partners, and our agreements may be the subject of contractual disputes. If we or our partners are not successful in commercializing the products covered by the agreements, such commercial failure could adversely affect our business.\nPursuant to license and distribution agreements with unrelated third party pharmaceutical companies, we are dependent on such companies to supply us with product that we market and sell, and we may enter into similar agreements in the future. Any delay or interruption in the supply of product under such agreements could curtail or delay our product shipment and adversely affect our revenues, as well as jeopardize our relationships with our customers.\nFrom time to time we may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market our products may be inhibited or prevented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on qualified scientific and technical employees and are increasingly dependent on our direct sales force, and our limited resources may make it more difficult to attract and retain these personnel.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel. We are not aware of any pending, significant losses of scientific or technical personnel. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key scientific and technical personnel, however, would be significantly detrimental to our product-development programs. As a result of our small size and limited financial and other resources, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and qualified scientific and technical personnel.\nIn addition, marketing of our branded products, such as the Zomig\u00ae products pursuant to our AZ Agreement with AstraZeneca and Rytary\u00ae, requires much greater use of a direct sales force compared to marketing of our generic products. Our ability to realize significant revenues from marketing and sales activities depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense. Any failure to attract or retain qualified sales personnel could negatively impact our sales revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees that provide that the executive officer may terminate his or her employment upon 60 days prior written notice to us. All of our other key personnel are employed on an at-will basis with no formal employment agreements. We do not maintain \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on any executives.\nWe are subject to significant costs and uncertainties related to compliance with the extensive regulations that govern the manufacturing, labeling, distribution, promotion and sale of pharmaceutical products as well as environmental, safety and health regulations.\nThe manufacturing, distribution, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, promotion and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by federal agencies, including the FDA, DEA, FTC, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Environmental Protection Agency, among others. We are also subject to state and local laws, regulations and agencies in California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Such regulations are also subject to change by the relevant federal, state and international agencies. For instance, beginning from January 1, 2015, we have been required to comply with certain requirements under the Drug Quality and Security Act (\u201cDQSA\u201d), specifically Title II of the DQSA, referred to as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, which requires companies in certain prescription drugs\u2019 chain of distribution to build electronic, interoperable systems to identify and trace the products as they are distributed in the United States. Compliance with the Drug Supply Chain Security Act has resulted in increased expenses for us and has imposed greater administrative burdens on our organization. Compliance with further requirements of the DQSA or any future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may result in further expenditures.\nAs further described above under the risk factor, \u201cManufacturing or quality control problems may damage our reputation for quality production, demand costly remedial activities and negatively impact our business, results of operations and consolidated financial condition,\u201d we are required to comply with the requirements of the FDA and our products are required to be manufactured in a manner consistent with cGMP and other similar standards. If we, or one of our third party suppliers, fail to comply with the FDA requirements and other applicable laws and regulations, we may breach our representations made to our customers or the FDA or other governmental may take action against us or our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FDA may also require labeling revisions, formulation or manufacturing changes and/or product modifications or additional safety data for our new or existing products. If the FDA imposes more stringent requirements or requires any additional safety, testing or remedial measures on our products or product candidates, we could incur increased costs for, or delays in, obtaining approval of such products or be required to remove such products from the market. For instance, we have derived a portion of our revenue from the sale of generic oxymorphone hydrochloride ER, a pharmaceutical product in the opioid class of drugs. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has declared the wide spread addiction to and abuse of opioid products a public health emergency in the United States. Changing public and clinical perceptions of opioid products and the risks relating to their use may result in the imposition of even stricter regulation, or even the removal of, such products by the FDA or other governmental agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to environmental, safety and health laws and regulations, we cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that we may be required to make in order to comply with such laws as they apply to our operations and facilities. We are also subject to potential liability for the remediation of contamination associated with both present and past hazardous waste generation, handling, and disposal activities. We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by environmental, safety, and health regulatory agencies. Environmental laws are subject to change and we may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and face larger capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws.\nCompliance with federal and state and local law regulations, including compliance with any newly enacted regulations, requires substantial expenditures of time, money and effort to ensure full technical compliance. Failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations can result in fines, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, exposure to product liability claims, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, suspension of the FDA\u2019s review of NDAs or ANDAs, enforcement actions, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience reductions in the levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products by governmental authorities, HMOs or other third-party payors. Any such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious governmental authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs, provide reimbursement to consumers for the cost of certain pharmaceutical products. Demand for our products depends in part on the extent to which such reimbursement is available. In addition, third-party payors are attempting to control costs by limiting the level of reimbursement for medical products, including pharmaceuticals, and increasingly challenge the pricing of these products which may adversely affect the pricing of our products. Moreover, health care reform has been, and is expected to continue to be, an area of national and state focus, which could result in the adoption of measures that could adversely affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals or the amount of reimbursement available from third-party payors for our products.\nReporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other government programs are complex, and failure to comply could result in sanctions and penalties or we could be required to reimburse the government for underpayments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMedicaid and other government reporting and payment obligations are highly complex and somewhat ambiguous. State attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice have brought suits or instituted investigations against a number of other pharmaceutical companies for failure to comply with Medicaid and other government reporting obligations. Our methodologies for making these calculations are complex and the judgments involved require us to make subjective decisions, such that these calculations are subject to the risk of errors. Government agencies may impose civil or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. Any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative or regulatory programs that may influence prices of prescription drugs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCurrent or future federal or state laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. Programs in existence in certain states seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular, state Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the price we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, as described in detail above under the risk factor \u201cOur business is highly dependent on market perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. Our business, products or pricing could be subject to negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d pharmaceutical product prices have been the focus of increased scrutiny by the government, including certain state attorneys general, members of congress and the United States Department of Justice. Decreases in health care reimbursements or prices of our prescription drugs could limit our ability to sell our products or decrease our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements governing sales, marketing and pricing of our products may result in substantial fines, sanctions and restrictions on our business activities.\nOur practices and activities related to the sales and marketing of our products, as well as the pricing of our products, are subject to extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state healthcare statutes and regulations intended to combat fraud and abuse to federal and state healthcare payment programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, Tri-Care, CHAMPUS, and Department of Defense programs. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and similar state laws and implementing regulations. For example, the payment of any incentive to a healthcare provider to induce the recommendation of our product or the purchase of our products reimbursable under a federal or state program is prohibited under these laws. Likewise, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to a federal or state health care program would expose a company to sanctions and penalties. Similarly, the inaccurate reporting of prices leading to inflated reimbursement rates would also be considered a violation of these laws. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act enacted in 2010 imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on drug manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. Failure to submit this required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties. These laws and regulations are enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, state Medicaid Fraud Units and other state enforcement agencies.\nViolations of the laws and regulations described above are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including substantial fines and penal sanctions, such as imprisonment. It is common for enforcement agencies to initiate investigations into sales and marketing practices, as well as pricing practices, regardless of merit. These types of investigations and any related litigation can result in: (i) large expenditures of cash for legal fees, payment for penalties, and compliance activities; (ii) limitations on operations; (iii) diversion of management resources; (iv) injury to our reputation; and (v) decreased demand for our products.\nWhile we have developed corporate compliance programs based on what we believe to be current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees or agents are or will be in compliance with all applicable federal or state regulations and laws. Further, the criteria for determining compliance are often complex and subject to change and interpretation. If we are in violation of any of these requirements or any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could include the imposition of significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs or other sanctions, any which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into, and anticipate entering into, contracts with various U.S. government agencies. Unfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which may be customary, may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment contracts customarily contain provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to:\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar the contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency;\n\u2022\nterminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022\nreduce the scope and value of contracts;\n\u2022\nchange certain terms and conditions in contracts;\n\u2022\nclaim rights to products, including intellectual property, developed under the contract;\n\u2022\ntake actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected;\n\u2022\ndirect the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor;\n\u2022\naudit and object to the contractor\u2019s contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and\n\u2022\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of the contractor\u2019s products.\nGenerally, government contracts contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the government\u2019s convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination.\nIf the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Some government contracts grant the government the right to use, for or on behalf of the U.S. government, any technologies developed by the contractor under the government contract. If we were to develop technology under a contract with such a provision, we might not be able to prohibit third parties, including our competitors, from using that technology in providing products and services to the government.\nAs a government contractor, we may also become subject to periodic audits and reviews. As part of any such audit or review, the government may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our purchasing, property, compensation and/or management information systems. In addition, if an audit or review uncovers any improper or illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in the United States may harm our future business.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for, healthcare services in the United States, and it is likely that Congress and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on healthcare reform in the future. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively commonly referred to as the \u201cHealthcare Reform Act\u201d became effective on January 1, 2010 and amongst other changes, increased the minimum Medicaid drug rebates for pharmaceutical companies and revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which affected the amount of our Medicaid drug rebates to states and imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation. If significant additional reforms are made to the United States healthcare system, those reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our intellectual property, and our future success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property and not infringe on the rights of others.\nWe believe intellectual property protection is important to our business and that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the rights of others. We cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\nany of our future processes or products will be patentable;\n\u2022\nour processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties; or\n\u2022\nwe will have the resources to defend against charges of patent infringement by third parties or to protect our own rights against infringement by third parties.\nWe rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge related to our products and technology which we generally seek to protect by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, licensees and pharmaceutical companies. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known by our competitors.\nWe are subject to potential product liability claims that can result in substantial litigation costs and liability.\nThe design, development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult to obtain, and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Although we currently carry $50.0 million of such insurance, we believe that no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all such risks because of the potential liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceutical products for human consumption.\nChanges in tax regulations, including the U.S. federal tax reform, and varying application and interpretations of these regulations could result in an increase in our existing and future tax liabilities.\nWe have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations, including exposures with respect to manufacturing, research and development, marketing, sales and distribution functions. For instance, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the \u201c2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d). The 2017 Tax Reform Act contains significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate does not currently materially impact the value of our net deferred tax assets, because we are currently in a full valuation allowance. However, the limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation under the terms of the 2017 Tax Reform Act may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks under the 2017 Tax Reform Act may also have a material effect on our cash flows.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any future changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used or necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement of our results.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. This involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement. Any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.\nOur management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses may result in current and potential stockholders and alliance and collaboration agreements\u2019 partners losing confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to retain our current, or obtain new, alliance and collaboration agreements\u2019 partners.\nIn addition, the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. Although we remedied any past accounting issues and do not believe similar accounting problems are likely to recur, an internal control material weakness may develop in the future and affect our ability to timely file our periodic reports. The inability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act could result in the SEC revoking the registration of our common stock, which would prohibit us from listing or having our stock quoted on any public market. This would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price by limiting the publicly available information regarding us and greatly reducing the ability of our stockholders to sell or trade our common stock.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect our business.\nTerrorist attacks at or nearby our facility in Hayward, California may negatively affect our operations. While we do not believe that we are more susceptible to such attacks than other companies, such attacks could directly affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could make the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our sales.\nWe carry insurance coverage on our facilities of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general and the scope and cost of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. Currently, we carry terrorism insurance as part of our property and casualty and business interruption coverage. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged facilities, as well as the anticipated future net sales from those facilities.\nWe are party to various agreements as part of our normal course of business which periodically incorporate provisions whereby we indemnify the other party to the agreement.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into commercial, employment, legal settlement and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions. In some but not all cases, we maintain insurance coverage which we believe will effectively mitigate our obligations under certain of these indemnification provisions. However, should our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed any applicable coverage or should coverage be denied, we could experience a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the location of our manufacturing and research and development facilities, our operations could be interrupted by an earthquake or be susceptible to climate changes.\nOur corporate headquarters, manufacturing operations, and research and development activities related to process technologies located in California are located near major earthquake fault lines. Although we use third party manufacturers to produce a number of our products, we produce a substantial portion of our products at our California facility. A disruption at these California facilities due to an earthquake, other natural disaster, or due to climate changes, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis. In addition, we could experience a destruction of facilities which would be costly to rebuild, or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe presently carry $100.0 million and $25.0 million of earthquake coverage related to our facilities and property (including inventory) located in Hayward, California and Memphis, TN, respectively. For all other worldwide locations where we have facilities and/or property, we presently carry $100.0 million of earthquake coverage. We believe the aggregate amount of earthquake coverage we currently carry is appropriate in light of the risks; however, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. We may discontinue some or all of this insurance coverage in the future if the cost of premiums exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged facilities, as well as the anticipated future net sales from those facilities.\nThe expansion of social media platforms present new risks and challenges, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could seriously damage our reputation. Further, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss as there might not be structured processes in place to secure and protect information. If our non-public sensitive information is disclosed or if our reputation is seriously damaged through social media, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Business Combination with Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC\nThe transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement with Amneal may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all, and failure to complete the transactions may result in material adverse consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs discussed under \u201cItem 1. Business - \u201cBusiness Combination with Amneal Pharmaceuticals\u201d, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement whereby we have agreed with Amneal to combine our generics and specialty pharmaceutical businesses with the generic drug development and manufacturing business of Amneal.\nThe Combination is subject to several closing conditions, including the adoption of the Business Combination Agreement by our stockholders, the approval of the listing of the Class A Common Stock to be issued in connection with the issuance of shares by Holdco, and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under (\u201cHSR Act\u201d). If any one of these conditions is not satisfied or waived, the Combination may not be completed. We cannot assure that we will complete the Combination on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nThe parties have not yet obtained all regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the Combination. Governmental or regulatory agencies could still seek to block or challenge the Combination or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the Combination. These restrictions could include a requirement that we sell certain specified assets to obtain such regulatory approvals, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If these approvals are not received, then we will not be obligated to complete the Combination.\nIf our stockholders do not approve and adopt the Business Combination Agreement and thereby approve the Combination or if the Combination is not completed for any other reason, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe and are our stockholders would not realize the anticipated benefits of the Combination, including any anticipated synergies from combining the two companies;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay a termination fee of $45.0 million if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with the specified terms thereof;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to reimburse Amneal for all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Amneal in connection with the Business Combination Agreement and the Combination up to a maximum of $15.0 million in the event that we fail to receive the required approval from our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe trading price of our shares may experience increased volatility to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Combination will be completed.\nWe are also exposed to general competitive pressures and risks, which may be increased if the Combination is not completed. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nGovernmental entities or private parties could take actions under antitrust laws to enjoin the completion of the Combination or to seek the divestiture of substantial assets of Impax.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Combination, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC or other state governmental entity could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Combination or seeking divestiture of a substantial amount of our assets. A divestiture of a substantial amount of our assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or prospects before and after Closing, diminish the anticipated benefits of the Combination in full or in part, or cause the benefits to take longer to be realized than expected. Further, private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Combination is pending that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Combination on our employees and customers may have a material and adverse effect on our business, regardless of whether the Combination is eventually completed. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Combination is completed, or the Business Combination Agreement is terminated, and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change our existing business relationships.\nEmployee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging for us during the pendency of the Combination, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us or with New Amneal. The departure of existing key employees or the failure of potential key employees to accept or maintain employment with us despite our retention and recruiting efforts, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition, regardless of whether the Combination is eventually completed.\nThe pursuit of the Combination and the preparation for the integration of the two companies have placed, and will continue to place, a significant burden on our management and internal resources. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of closing the Combination and planning for the integration of the two companies, which could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our existing businesses, regardless of whether the Combination is eventually completed. Before and immediately following Closing, our management team will be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration planning process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage their respective existing businesses, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products, services or strategies. One potential consequence of such distractions could be the failure of management to realize other opportunities that could be beneficial to us. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the process leading up to and immediately following Closing, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration planning process, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Business Combination Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of Amneal until the Combination is consummated or the Business Combination Agreement is terminated. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our businesses before completion of the Combination or termination of the Business Combination Agreement, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe integration of Impax and Amneal following the Closing will present challenges that may result in a decline in the anticipated benefits of the Combination.\nThe Combination involves the integration of two businesses that currently operate as independent businesses. We and Amneal will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations following the Closing, and prior to the Combination, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. Potential difficulties we, Amneal or New Amneal may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate the two businesses, including operations, technologies, products and services, in a manner that permits us, Amneal or New Amneal to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the Combination, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the Combination not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nthe loss of sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two businesses deciding not to continue to do business with us or Amneal, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Combination;\n\u2022\nthe integration of personnel with diverse business backgrounds and business cultures, while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;\n\u2022\nthe consolidation and rationalization of information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures as well as accounting systems and related financial reporting activities;\n\u2022\nthe potential weakening of established relationships with regulators; and\n\u2022\nthe challenge of preserving important relationships of both us and Amneal and resolving potential conflicts that may arise.\nFurthermore, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of our talented employees or skilled workers. The loss of talented employees and skilled workers could adversely affect our, Amneal\u2019s or New Amneal\u2019s ability to successfully conduct their respective businesses because of such employees\u2019 experience and knowledge of our business and Amneal\u2019s business. In addition, we, Amneal or New Amneal could be adversely affected by the diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two businesses. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our or Amneal\u2019s segments. If we, Amneal or New Amneal experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Combination may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. These integration matters could have a material and adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of us, Amneal or New Amneal during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Combination.\nOwnership interests will not be adjusted if there is a change in the value of our company or Amneal and their respective assets before the Combination is completed.\nThe interests of Class A Common Stock received by our stockholders in connection with the Combination will not be adjusted if there is a change in the value or assets of Amneal, Impax or New Amneal prior to the consummation of the Combination. No termination rights will arise in connection with an adverse change at Amneal or our company unless there has been an Amneal Material Adverse Effect or an Impax Material Adverse Effect as applicable (in each case as defined in the Business Combination Agreement).\nThe Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us.\nThe Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that may discourage third parties from submitting business combination proposals to us that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the Combination. The Business Combination Agreement generally prohibits us from soliciting any competing acquisition proposal. In addition, if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated by us or Amneal in circumstances that obligate us to pay a termination fee of $45.0 million or to reimburse transaction expenses of up to $15.0 million incurred by Amneal, our financial condition may be adversely affected as a result of the payment of the termination fee and transaction expenses, which might deter third parties from proposing alternative business combination proposals.\nAfter the Combination is complete, our stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in New Amneal than the Existing Amneal Members and will exercise less influence over New Amneal than they do over our company.\nUpon the completion of the Combination, each holder of Impax shares of common stock will have a percentage ownership of New Amneal that is smaller than such holder\u2019s percentage ownership of our company immediately prior to the Combination. At the Closing, approximately 75% of the total New Amneal Shares will not be held by our stockholders. Following the Closing, Existing Amneal Members are expected to hold approximately 60% of the voting power of the outstanding New Amneal Shares and following the PIPE Investment, the PIPE investors will hold approximately 15% of the voting power of the outstanding New Amneal Shares.\nIn addition, the Class A Common Stock to be received by our stockholders as consideration if the Combination is completed will have different rights than shares in Impax common stock.\nWe will incur transaction-related costs in connection with the Combination and the integration of our business with Amneal\u2019s business.\nWe will incur transaction-related costs in connection with the Combination and in connection with the integration of our business with Amneal\u2019s business following the Closing. There are many systems that must be integrated, including information management, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, and regulatory compliance. We and Amneal are in the early stages of assessing the magnitude of these costs and are therefore unable to provide estimates of these costs. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Such expenses could, particularly in the near term, reduce the cost synergies that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost synergies related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the Combination. Accordingly, any net synergies may not be achieved in the near term or at all. These integration expenses may result in us, Amneal or New Amneal taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Combination. Some of these costs and expenses will be incurred even if the Combination is not consummated, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPending litigation against us or Amneal could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Combination or a judgment resulting in the payment of damages.\nWe, Amneal and members of our respective boards are currently and may in the future be parties, among others, to various claims and litigation related to the Business Combination Agreement and the Combination, including putative shareholder class actions - see \u201cNote 19. Legal and Regulatory Matters.\u201d for additional details regarding the shareholder class actions. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs in such matters are seeking to enjoin the Combination. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the Combination from becoming effective in a timely manner. The existence of litigation relating to the Combination could impact the likelihood of obtaining the required approval from our stockholders in order to complete the Combination. Moreover, the pending litigation is, and any future additional litigation could be, time consuming and expensive, could divert the attention of our management away from our regular business, and, if any one of these lawsuits is adversely resolved against either us or Amneal, could have a material adverse effect on our respective businesses, results of operation and financial condition.\nOne of the conditions to the Closing is that no governmental entity will have issued an order or injunction or taken any other action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Combination, and that no law will have been enacted or promulgated by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction which prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Combination. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the litigation referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our and/or Amneal\u2019s ability to complete the Combination on the terms contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Combination from being completed in a timely manner or at all.", "PERMNO": 82702, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "IPXL"}
