{"cik": "802724", "company": "INSITE VISION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur cash on hand, anticipated cash flow from operations and the net proceeds from our existing debt financing arrangements will only fund our business until approximately May 2015. We need to enter into a strategic transaction or raise additional funds in the near future, which funding could be difficult to obtain or could significantly dilute the value and rights of our common stock, and if not obtained in satisfactory amounts, may prevent us from developing our products, conducting clinical trials or otherwise taking advantage of future opportunities or growing our business, any of which could harm our business\nOur independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, included in this report, referring to our recurring losses from operations, available cash balance and accumulated deficit and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe expect that our cash on hand, anticipated cash flow from operations and the net proceeds from our existing debt financing arrangements will only enable us to continue operations until approximately May 2015. At that point, or earlier if circumstances change from our current expectations, we will either have to enter into a strategic transaction or we will require substantial additional funding from the issuance of debt or equity securities, payments under existing or future collaboration agreements, asset sales or other sources. We cannot assure you that any strategic transaction or additional funding will be available on a timely basis, or on reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe current worldwide financing environment is challenging, particularly for smaller capitalized businesses such as ours, which combined with the negative results of our AzaSite Plus/DexaSite Phase 3 trial, challenges in our past relationship with Merck, uncertainties regarding our current and future relationship with Akorn and uncertainties regarding our ability to commercialize additional products could make it more difficult for us to raise funds on reasonable terms, or at all. If we issue additional equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution, which could be substantial, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we raise funds through debt, we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants, which would restrict operating flexibility and could harm our business. In addition, the existence of the explanatory paragraph in the audit report may make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing, may adversely affect the terms of such financing and could prevent investors from purchasing our shares in the open market as certain investors may be restricted or precluded from investing in companies that have received this explanatory paragraph in an audit report. Further, the factors leading to the explanatory paragraph in the audit report may harm our ability to obtain additional funding and could make the terms of any such funding, if available, less favorable than might otherwise be the case. We sometimes receive inquiries related to strategic transactions and have and will continue to actively consider potential strategic transactions. If we are unable to secure additional financing or consummate a strategic transaction, we would have to cease operations and liquidate our assets.\nIt is difficult to evaluate our business because we are in an early stage of commercializing our products, our product candidates are still in clinical trials and successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain and requires significant expenditures, risk and time\nWe are still in an early stage of commercializing our products. AzaSite received regulatory approval in the U.S. in April 2007 and commercial sales of AzaSite began in the third quarter of 2007. Besivance received regulatory approval in May 2009 and commercial sales of Besivance began in the second half of 2009. We must receive approval in other countries prior to marketing AzaSite in such countries. Before regulatory authorities grant us marketing approval for additional products, we need to conduct significant additional research and development and preclinical and clinical testing and submit New Drug Applications, or NDAs. Successful\ndevelopment of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain. Products that appear promising in research or development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development or the market for several reasons, including:\n\u2022\npreclinical tests may show the product to be toxic or lack efficacy in animal models;\n\u2022\nfailure to receive the necessary U.S. or international regulatory approvals or a delay in receiving such approvals due to, among other things, slow enrollment in clinical studies, failure to achieve study endpoints within the time period prescribed by the study, or at all, additional time requirements for data analysis or BLA or NDA preparation, discussions with the FDA, FDA requests for additional preclinical or clinical data, analyses or changes to study design; or safety, efficacy or manufacturing issues;\n\u2022\nclinical trial results may show the product to be less effective than desired or to have harmful or problematic side effects;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in formulating the product, scaling the manufacturing process, or getting necessary manufacturing approvals;\n\u2022\neven if safe and effective, manufacturing costs, pricing, reimbursement issues or other factors may make the product uneconomical;\n\u2022\nproprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies may prevent the product from being developed or commercialized; or\n\u2022\ninability to compete with superior, equivalent, more cost-effective or more effectively promoted products offered by competitors.\nTherefore, our research and development activities may not result in any commercially viable products.\nWe have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to have losses in the future\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 1986 and have pursued numerous drug development candidates that failed to achieve clinical end points or did not prove to have commercial potential. We expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future or until we are able to achieve significant royalties or other revenues from sales of our products. Attaining significant revenue or profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with third parties, to develop our potential products successfully, conduct clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and market our products successfully. We may not ever achieve or be able to maintain significant revenue or profitability, including with respect to AzaSite, our lead product which has experienced declining sales in the United States, and has continued to decline further following Akorn\u2019s acquisition of Inspire from Merck in November 2013. In addition, our right to receive minimum royalties from Merck terminated in September 2013. AzaSite has not been commercially launched outside the United States.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design, enroll and implement and there can never be any assurance that the results of such clinical trials will be favorable\nHuman clinical trials for our product candidates are very expensive and difficult to design, enroll and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. A significant portion of our operating expenses in the past three years were incurred on our AzaSite Plus/DexaSite Phase 3 clinical trial and BromSite Phase 3 clinical trial. Despite the significant time, expense and resources devoted to the trial, the AzaSite Plus/DexaSite Phase 3 clinical trial did not meet its clinical endpoints as required by the FDA and the future development of these product candidates is uncertain. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. We may experience difficulties or delays in enrolling our clinical trials, which can delay the trials and our ability to obtain ultimate approval of our product candidates. In addition, we require various clinical materials to conduct our clinical trials and any unavailability or delay in our ability to obtain these materials may delay our\ntrials, cause them to be more expensive or preclude us from completing these trials, which would harm our ability to obtain approval for our product candidates and therefore harm our business. We estimate that any particular clinical trial may take over a year to complete and will be very expensive. Furthermore, we could encounter problems that might cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials resulting in additional expense, further delays and potentially preventing the completion of such trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to several factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials, including failure to meet required clinical endpoints;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in determining dosing and trial protocols;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining clinical materials or participants necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of clinical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our submissions or the conduct of these trials. In any such case, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, in which case we would not obtain any benefit from our substantial investment in developing the product and conducting clinical trials for such products.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that the results will support our product candidate claims. Even if pre-clinical testing and clinical trials for a product candidate are successful, this does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing, meet our expectations or defined clinical endpoints, or satisfy the FDA or other regulatory bodies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans or effective for indicated uses. In addition, our clinical trials involve relatively small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results. Any such failure would likely cause us to abandon the product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay or preclude the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.\nFor example, results from our 2008 Phase 3 clinical trial of AzaSite Plus for the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis showed improved clinical outcomes as compared to treatment with a corticosteroid or antibiotic alone in the reduction of inflammatory signs and symptoms and bacterial eradication, respectively. However, the trial did not achieve its primary clinical endpoint as defined by the protocol. In 2013, our AzaSite Plus/DexaSite Phase 3 clinical trial also failed to meet its primary endpoint. The future development of these product candidates is unclear and we may not receive any return on our significant investments in AzaSite Plus or DexaSite. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to file an NDA for BromSite, in a timely manner or at all, or that we will ever achieve FDA approval for the commercialization of AzaSite Plus, DexaSite, or BromSite. Our lack of cash resources may cause us to have to delay filing NDAs for BromSite or DexaSite, delaying any FDA approvals and commercialization of either product.\nOur strategy for commercialization of our products requires us to enter into successful arrangements with corporate collaborators\nWe generally intend to enter into partnering and collaborative arrangements with respect to the commercialization of our product candidates. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into such arrangements or that they will be beneficial to us. The success of our partnering and collaboration arrangements will depend upon many factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our preclinical and clinical testing and research and development programs;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe market, or perceived market, for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour financial condition, and ability to perform our obligations to our potential partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to negotiate favorable terms with potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nthe efforts and success of our collaborators in further developing or marketing the product;\n\u2022\nour ability to prosecute, defend and enforce patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of possible future legal actions; and\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments.\nWe may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to support the commercialization of our products on acceptable terms, or at all, and may not be able to maintain any arrangement that we do enter into. If we pursue a partnership for BromSite or our other product candidates prior to successfully filing an NDA or completing Phase 3 trials, we will likely receive less favorable economic terms than if we successfully filed an NDA or completed Phase 3 trials.\nThe commercial success of our products is dependent on the diligent efforts of our corporate collaborators\nBecause we generally rely on third parties for the marketing and sale of our products, revenues that we receive will be highly dependent on the efforts and success of these third parties. In November 2013, Akorn acquired Inspire from Merck and Akorn became responsible for the commercialization of AzaSite in the United States. Prior to Akorn\u2019s acquisition of Inspire, the monthly prescriptions and our earned royalty revenues on net sales of AzaSite by Merck had decreased significantly, a trend that has continued subsequent to Akorn\u2019s acquisition of Inspire in November 2013. In June 2014, we amended the Akorn License to, among other things, reduce the royalty rate we receive to a tiered royalty percentage ranging from 8.0% to 15.0% of AzaSite net sales, depending on the level of such sales. We believe that our AzaSite royalties will likely decline further in future periods due to the reduced royalty rate and declining prescriptions for AzaSite. In addition, our partners, including Akorn, may terminate their relationships with us and/or may not diligently or successfully market or sell our products. Akorn can terminate the Akorn License at any time at its discretion. Akorn or other partners may also emphasize sales and marketing of their own or other products or pursue alternative or competing technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors. In addition, marketing consultants and contract sales organizations that we use for our products may market products that compete with our products and we must rely on their efforts and ability to market and sell our products effectively.\nIf we fail to enter into future collaborations or our current collaborations are terminated, we will need to enter into new collaborations or establish our own sales and marketing organization; our royalties under the Akorn license are subject to reduction, termination and suspension\nWe may not be able to enter into or maintain collaborative arrangements with third parties, including Akorn. If we are not successful in entering into future collaborations or maintaining our existing collaborations, we may be required to find new corporate collaborators or establish our own sales and marketing organization.\nWe do not have a long-standing relationship with Akorn, which acquired Inspire from Merck in November 2013. Prior to Akorn\u2019s acquisition of Inspire, and continuing since Akorn\u2019s acquisition, the number of monthly prescriptions and sales of AzaSite have significantly declined. While the minimum royalty payments from Merck had previously made up for this decline, Merck\u2019s minimum royalty payment obligations terminated in September 2013 and Akorn has no such obligations. Royalties under the Akorn License are subject to a cumulative reduction or offset in the event of patent invalidity, generic competition, uncured material breaches by us or in the event that Akorn is required to pay royalties, milestone payments or license fees to third parties for the continued use of AzaSite. In addition, the applicable royalty rate under the Akorn License is subject to reduction by up to 50% in any country during any period in which AzaSite does not have patent protection and Akorn\u2019s obligation to pay royalties may be suspended entirely upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a requirement by the FDA or other governmental agency to suspend the marketing of AzaSite or withdraw it from the market in the United States or if we are unable to obtain commercial quantities of AzaSite for Akorn to market and sell. Despite Akorn\u2019s acquisition of Inspire from Merck, we believe that our AzaSite royalties will likely decline further in future periods due to the reduced royalty rate and declining prescriptions for AzaSite.\nIf the Akorn License is terminated, we will have to find a new marketing partner or market AzaSite ourselves. There can be no assurance that any new partnership would be possible or on similar terms as the Akorn License or that it would be successful. If the Akorn License is terminated, our efforts to find a new third-party collaborator or pursue direct commercialization efforts ourselves will divert the attention of senior management from our current business operations, which could delay the development or licensing of our other product candidates. If we elect to commercialize AzaSite ourselves, we would have to expend significant resources as we currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities or experience, and have no current plans to establish any such resources. Our limited cash resources would likely preclude us from establishing any marketing or sales capabilities. Accordingly, our efforts to commercialize AzaSite ourselves, if undertaken, may not be successful and could harm our financial condition and results of operation. If we are unable to maintain existing collaborations, enter into additional collaborations or successfully market our products ourselves, our revenues and financial results would be significantly harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to engage third parties to assist us with the development of new products, new indications for existing products and the conduct of our clinical trials to achieve regulatory approval for commercialization and any failure or delay by those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans\nFor our business model to succeed, we must continually develop new products or discover new indications for our existing products. As part of that process, we rely on third parties such as clinical research organizations, clinical investigators and outside testing labs for development activities, such as Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical testing, and to assist us in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of their responsibilities but have no control over how these parties manage their businesses and cannot assure you that such parties will diligently or effectively perform their activities. For example, the clinical investigators that conducted our clinical trials, including our second BromSite Phase 3 clinical trial, were not our employees and we anticipate that any future clinical trials for any of our product candidates will also be conducted by third parties. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with applicable protocols, rules and regulations or in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial as well as the various rules and regulations governing clinical trials in the United States and abroad. Any failure by those parties to perform their duties effectively, in compliance with clinical trial protocols, or on a timely basis, could delay or cause cancellation of our clinical trials, cause us to have to repeat the clinical trials, thereby increasing our expenses, harm our ability to develop and commercialize new products, subject us to potential liabilities and harm our business.\nPhysicians and patients may not accept or use our products\nEven if the FDA approves our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept or use them. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nperceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products or treatments;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived benefits of competing products or treatments;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 comfort level and prior experience with and use of competing products or treatments; and\n\u2022\navailability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payers.\nWe may require additional licenses or be subject to expensive and uncertain patent litigation in order to sell our products\nA number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies, filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to our business. Some of these technologies, applications or patents may conflict with our technologies or patent applications. As is common in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging various challenges to our patent rights. Such conflicts, if proven, could invalidate our issued patents, limit the scope of the patents, if any, that we may be able to obtain, result in the denial of our patent applications or block our rights to exploit our technology. If the USPTO or foreign patent agencies have issued or in the future issue patents to other companies that cover our activities, we may not be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, or at all, or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in or be precluded altogether from introducing products to the market. If we are required to obtain additional licenses from third parties for the sale of AzaSite in the United States and Canada, we will be required to pay for such additional licenses from our existing cash or royalties received from Akorn.\nIn addition, we may need to litigate in order to defend against claims of infringement by others, to enforce patents issued to us or to protect trade secrets or know-how owned or licensed by us. Litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, particularly given our limited and declining cash resources. We have also agreed to indemnify our licensees against infringement claims by third parties related to our technology, which could result in additional litigation costs and liability for us. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us, thereby utilizing our very limited resources for purposes other than product development and commercialization.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u2022\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022\nstop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others, which could preclude us from commercializing our products;\n\u2022\npay damages; or\n\u2022\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings, which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our valuable management resources.\nOur business depends upon our proprietary rights and we may not be able to protect, enforce, or secure our intellectual property rights adequately\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain patents, protect trade secrets, obtain and maintain rights to technology developed by others, and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. A substantial number of patents in the field of ophthalmology and genetics have been issued to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. Moreover, competitors may have filed patent applications, may have been issued patents or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes competitive with ours. We cannot assure you that patents will be granted on a timely basis, or at all, on any of our patent applications or that the scope of any of our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. We may not be able to develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. Even if we receive patent issuances, those issued patents may not provide us with adequate protection for our inventions or may be challenged by others.\nIn April 2011, we received a letter (Notice Letter) from Sandoz, Inc. (Sandoz) providing notice that Sandoz has filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA seeking marketing approval for a 1% azithromycin ophthalmic solution (Sandoz Product) prior to the expiration of the five U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book for AzaSite which include four of our patents and one patent licensed to us by Pfizer. In the paragraph IV Certification accompanying the Sandoz ANDA filing, Sandoz alleges that the claims of the Orange Book listed patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the Sandoz Product. On May 26, 2011, we, Merck and Pfizer filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Sandoz and related entities. The plaintiff companies agreed that Merck will take the lead in prosecuting this lawsuit. On November 15, 2013, Akorn acquired Inspire from Merck and, as such, acquired the rights to AzaSite in North America. Akorn has taken the lead in prosecuting this lawsuit. Before the trial, the patents involved in the litigation were limited to the one Pfizer patent and three of our patents. On October 4, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a Final Judgment in favor of us and the other plaintiffs finding all the asserted claims of the patents in the litigation valid and infringed by Sandoz and related entities. The Court Order specified that the effective date of any FDA approval of a Sandoz ANDA for generic 1% azithromycin ophthalmic solution products would be no earlier than the expiration date of the patents in the litigation. On November 4, 2013, Sandoz filed an appeal of this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We and the other plaintiffs intend to vigorously contest any Sandoz assertions that these patents should have been found not infringed, invalid and/or unenforceable. An adverse decision on the issues of validity or enforceability on any such appeal would significantly harm our royalty revenue stream from AzaSite.\nIn May 2013, we received a Notice Letter that Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or Mylan, has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking marketing approval for a 1% azithromycin ophthalmic solution, or the Mylan Product, prior to the expiration of the U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book for AzaSite, which include three of our patents and one patent licensed to us by Pfizer. In the paragraph IV Certification accompanying the Mylan ANDA filing, Mylan alleges that the claims of the Orange Book listed patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed upon by the Mylan Product. On June 14, 2013, we, Merck and Pfizer filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Mylan and a related entity. On November 15, 2013, Akorn acquired Inspire from Merck and, as such, acquired the rights to AzaSite in North America. The plaintiff companies have agreed that Akorn will take the lead in prosecuting this lawsuit. The filing of this lawsuit triggered an automatic stay, or bar, of the FDA\u2019s approval of the ANDA for up to 30 months or until a final district court decision of the infringement lawsuit, whichever comes first. We and the other plaintiffs intend to vigorously enforce our patent rights relating to AzaSite and vigorously contest any Mylan assertions that these patents are invalid and/or unenforceable.\nFurthermore, the patents of others may impair our ability to commercialize our products. The patent positions of firms in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions, and have recently been the subject of significant litigation. The USPTO and the courts have not developed, formulated, or presented a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims\nallowed or the degree of protection afforded under pharmaceutical and genetic patents. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products or design around any of our patents. In addition, third parties from whom we have licensed or otherwise obtained technology may attempt to terminate or scale back our rights.\nWe also depend upon unpatented trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Our trade secrets may also be disclosed, and we may not be able to protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets effectively. To the extent that we, our consultants or our research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others, disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nThe failure to successfully market and commercialize AzaSite has continued to harm sales of AzaSite, which has made it unlikely that we will receive significant future revenue from sales of AzaSite\nThe success of the commercialization of AzaSite and our receipt of royalties under the Akorn License will depend on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe scope of Akorn\u2019s marketing of AzaSite in the United States;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s commitment to continuing the Akorn License with us;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s deployment of resources to market and sell AzaSite or lack thereof;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s marketing efforts outside of ophthalmologists;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s pricing decisions regarding AzaSite;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s marketing and selling of any current or future competing products;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness and extent of Akorn\u2019s promotional, sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s ability to build, train and retain an effective sales force;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s marketing efforts and success outside of eye care professionals, such as to pediatricians and primary care physicians;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s ability to successfully market AzaSite to physicians and patients;\n\u2022\nAkorn\u2019s ability to compete against larger and more experienced competitors;\n\u2022\nthe discovery of any side effects or negative efficacy findings for AzaSite;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or product liability claims relating to AzaSite;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of generic competition;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which competing products for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis obtain more favorable formulary status than AzaSite; and\n\u2022\nthe relevant parties\u2019 ability to adequately maintain or enforce the intellectual property rights relevant to AzaSite.\nPediatricians and primary care physicians write more than 67% of prescriptions for ophthalmic antibiotics. However, Akorn has no experience calling on pediatricians and primary care physicians. Akorn\u2019s focus on eye care professionals rather than pediatricians and primary care providers could result in lower AzaSite sales and therefore lower royalties paid to us. A large number of pharmaceutical companies, including those with competing products, much larger sales forces and much greater financial resources, and those with products for indications that are completely unrelated to AzaSite, compete for the time and attention of eye care professionals, pediatricians and primary care physicians. We have no control over how Akorn manages and operates its sales force, how effective Akorn\u2019s sales efforts will be or Akorn\u2019s pricing decisions regarding AzaSite.\nAkorn could experience financial or other difficulties unrelated to AzaSite that could adversely affect the marketing or sale of AzaSite. Moreover, Akorn could change its commercial strategy and deemphasize or sell or sublicense its rights to AzaSite. We cannot prevent Akorn from developing or licensing a product that competes with AzaSite or limiting or withdrawing its support of AzaSite.\nWe rely on a sole source for the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for AzaSite\nWe currently have a single supplier for azithromycin, the active drug incorporated into AzaSite, as well as AzaSite Plus and AzaSite Xtra. The supplier of azithromycin has a drug master file on the compound with the FDA and is subject to the FDA\u2019s review and oversight. The supplier\u2019s manufacturing facility is subject to potential natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires or explosions, and other interruptions in operation due to factors including labor unrest or strikes, failures of utility services or microbial or other contamination. If the supplier were to fail or refuse to continue to supply us or Akorn, if the FDA were to identify issues in the production of azithromycin that the supplier was unable to resolve quickly and cost-effectively, or if other issues were to arise that impact production, the manufacture and commercialization of AzaSite could be interrupted which could prevent us from receiving future revenue from AzaSite. Additional suppliers for azithromycin exist, but qualification of an alternative source would be required and could be time consuming and expensive and, during such qualification process, any shortage of azithromycin would negatively impact the sales of AzaSite and could delay the development timeline of AzaSite Plus and AzaSite Xtra.\nIn addition, certain of the raw materials that we use in formulating DuraSite, the drug delivery system used in AzaSite and our other products, are available only from Lubrizol Advanced Materials, Inc., or Lubrizol. Although we do not have a current supply agreement with Lubrizol, we have not encountered any difficulties obtaining necessary materials from Lubrizol. Any significant interruption in the supply of these raw materials could delay sales of AzaSite, which could prevent us from receiving future revenue from AzaSite.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets and our competitors\u2019 financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and human resources may surpass ours and limit our ability to develop and/or market our products and technologies\nOur success depends upon developing and maintaining a competitive advantage in the development of products and technologies in our areas of focus. We have many competitors in the United States and abroad, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies with varying resources and degrees of concentration in the ophthalmic market. Our competitors may have existing products or products under development which may be technically superior to ours or which may be less costly or more acceptable to the market. Our competitors may obtain cost advantages, patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would block or limit our ability to develop our potential products. Competition from these companies is intense and is expected to increase as new products enter the market and new technologies become available. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and human resources than we do, particularly in light of our current financial condition. In addition, they may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective, safer, less expensive or otherwise more commercially acceptable than any that we have or will develop. Our competitors may also obtain regulatory approval for commercialization of their products more effectively or rapidly than we will. If we decide to manufacture and market our products by ourselves, we will be competing in areas in which we have limited or no experience such as manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If our product candidates receive FDA approval, they will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing\nproducts may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will be harmed.\nWe compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have products competitive with AzaSite already approved or in development, including Zymar and Ocuflox by Allergan, Vigamox and Ciloxan by Alcon, and Quixin by Johnson & Johnson. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs and have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u2022\ndeveloping drugs;\n\u2022\nundertaking pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u2022\nformulating and manufacturing drugs;\n\u2022\nlaunching, marketing and selling drugs; and\n\u2022\nattracting qualified personnel, parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations.\nWe have to attract and retain key employees to be successful\nA critical factor to our success will be retaining our personnel or recruiting replacement personnel. Competition for skilled individuals in the biotechnology business, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is highly competitive, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business, particularly in light of our financial condition. Our ability to attract and retain such individuals may be harmed by our current financial situation, uncertainties regarding our ability to raise additional funds or continue our operations and the other challenges we face. Our employees may leave us to pursue other opportunities due to uncertainties regarding our financial condition or announcements or rumors regarding potential strategic transactions. The loss of key personnel, the failure to recruit replacement personnel or to develop needed expertise would harm our business.\nOur products are subject to government regulations and approvals which may delay or prevent the marketing of potential products and impose costly procedures upon our activities\nThe FDA and comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Lengthy and detailed preclinical and clinical testing, validation of manufacturing and quality control processes, and other costly and time-consuming procedures are required. Satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years and the time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. The effect of government regulation may be to delay or to prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and to impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, for any products we develop. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Further, even after we have obtained regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Moreover, the FDA has recently reduced previous restrictions on the marketing, sale and prescription of products for indications other than those specifically approved by the FDA. Accordingly, even if we receive FDA approval of a product for certain\nindicated uses, our competitors, including our collaborators, could market products for such indications even if such products have not been specifically approved for such indications. If the FDA determines regulatory approval is required, any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals would make it difficult or impossible to market our products and would harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the United States could result in new government regulations that could harm our business. Adverse governmental regulation might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. See \u201cUncertainties regarding healthcare reform and third-party reimbursement may impair our ability to raise capital, form collaborations and sell our products.\u201d\nWe have no experience in commercial manufacturing and if contract manufacturing is not available to us or does not satisfy regulatory requirements, we will have to establish our own regulatory compliant manufacturing capability and may not have the financial resources to do so\nWe have no experience manufacturing products for Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial purposes at our own facility. We have a pilot facility licensed by the State of California to manufacture a number of our products for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials but not for late stage clinical trials or commercial purposes. Therefore, we rely on a single contract manufacturer for a substantial portion of our manufacturing requirements. Any delays or difficulties that we may encounter in establishing and maintaining a relationship with qualified manufacturers to produce, package and distribute our products may harm our clinical trials, regulatory filings, market introduction and subsequent sales of our products.\nContract manufacturers must adhere to cGMP regulations that are strictly enforced by the FDA on an ongoing basis through the FDA\u2019s facilities inspection program, as well as by foreign governmental associations outside the United States. Contract manufacturing facilities must pass a pre-approval plant inspection before the FDA will approve an NDA. Some of the material manufacturing changes that occur after approval are also subject to FDA review and clearance or approval. While the FDA has approved the AzaSite manufacturing process and facility, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may not approve the process or the facilities by which any of our other products may be manufactured or could rescind their approval of the AzaSite manufacturing process or facility. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture our products may harm our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis. To the extent that we change manufacturers or engage additional manufacturers in the United States or abroad, we may experience delays, increased costs, quality-control issues and other issues that could harm our ability to conduct clinical trials and market and sell our products. Should we be required to manufacture products ourselves, we will:\n\u2022\nbe required to expend significant amounts of capital to install a manufacturing capability;\n\u2022\nbe subject to the regulatory requirements described above;\n\u2022\nbe subject to similar risks regarding delays or difficulties encountered in manufacturing any such products; and\n\u2022\nrequire substantially more additional capital than we otherwise may require.\nTherefore, we may not be able to manufacture any products successfully or in a cost-effective manner.\nUncertainties regarding healthcare reform and third-party reimbursement may impair our ability to raise capital, form collaborations and sell our products\nThe continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means may harm our business. For example, in some foreign markets, the pricing or profitability of healthcare products is subject to government control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect\nthere will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control, which could lead to lower reimbursement rates for our products or no reimbursement at all. The implementation or even the announcement of any of these legislative or regulatory proposals or reforms could harm our business by reducing the prices we or our partners are able to charge for our products, impeding our ability to achieve profitability, raise capital or form collaborations. In addition, the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers determines, in large part, the demand for healthcare products in the United States and elsewhere. Examples of such third-party payers are government and private insurance plans. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. If we or our partners succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, reimbursement from third-party payers may not be available or may not be sufficient to allow the sale of these products on a competitive or profitable basis.\nOur insurance coverage may not adequately cover our potential product liability exposure\nWe are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human therapeutic products. Product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is expensive. Although we believe our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover likely claims we may encounter given our current stage of development and activities, our present product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims we may encounter, particularly if AzaSite is commercialized outside the United States and Canada. If AzaSite is commercialized in other countries, we may have to increase our coverage, which will be expensive, and we may not be able to obtain or afford adequate insurance coverage against potential claims in sufficient amounts or at a reasonable cost.\nOur use of hazardous materials may pose environmental risks and liabilities which may cause us to incur significant costs\nOur research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of small amounts of hazardous solvents used in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing, including acetic acid, acetone, acrylic acid, calcium chloride, chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethyl alcohol, hydrogen chloride, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and other similar solvents. We retain a licensed outside contractor that specializes in the disposal of hazardous materials used in the biotechnology industry to properly dispose of these materials, but we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Our cost for the disposal services rendered by our outside contractor was not material for the years ended 2014, 2013, or 2012, respectively. In the event of an accident involving these materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Moreover, as our business develops we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and policies, especially to the extent that we manufacture our own products.\nManagement and principal stockholders may be able to exert significant control on matters requiring approval by our stockholders\nAs of January 31, 2015, our management and principal stockholders (those owning more than 5% of our outstanding shares) together beneficially owned approximately 47% of our shares of common stock. As a result, our management and principal stockholders, acting together or individually, may be able to exert significant control on matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all or at least a majority of our Board of Directors, the approval of amendments to our charter, and the approval of business combinations and certain financing transactions. In September 2008, a group of our stockholders prevailed in a proxy contest that resulted in the replacement of all members of our Board of Directors.\nThe market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as ours have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile due to reasons that are related and unrelated to our operating performance and progress; registration of the common stock underlying the warrants issued, or to be issued, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement we entered into in connection with our October 2014 debt financing, or the subsequent sale of such common stock, may cause our stock price to decline; we have not paid dividends in the past and do not anticipate doing so in the future\nThe market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, have been highly volatile. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In addition, future announcements and circumstances such as our current financial condition and need for substantial additional funding to continue our operations beyond May 2015, the audit report included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations, available cash balance and accumulated deficit and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, our ability to obtain new financing, any announcements or rumors regarding strategic alternatives we pursue or that terminate, our likelihood of raising additional funding, the status of our relationships or proposed relationships with third-party collaborators, including Akorn, the results of testing and clinical trials, future sales of equity or debt securities by us, the exercise of outstanding options and warrants that could result in dilution to our current holders of common stock, developments in our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors, our failure to meet analyst expectations, any litigation regarding the same, technological innovations or new therapeutic products, governmental regulation, or public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others and general market conditions concerning us, our competitors or other biopharmaceutical companies may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. For example, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, our closing stock price fluctuated from a high of $0.36 to a low of $0.12. Such fluctuations can lead to securities class action litigation and make it difficult to obtain financing. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have filed one registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to register the resale of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement we entered into in connection with our October 2014 debt financing. To the extent that we draw down additional amounts under the debt financing, we will be obligated to file one or more additional registration statements with the SEC to register the resale of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with such additional borrowings. Filing of a registration statement, or the subsequent sale of the common stock covered by such registration statement, may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nOur common stock trades on the OTCBB\nOur common stock currently trades on the over-the-counter bulletin board (OTCBB) market, although there are no assurances that it will continue to trade on this market. Over-the-counter (OTC) transactions involve risks in addition to those associated with transactions on a stock exchange. Listing on the OTC rather than a stock exchange could harm the trading volume and liquidity of our common stock and, as a result, the market price for our common stock might become more volatile. Listing on the OTC rather than on a major stock exchange could also cause a reduction in the number of investors willing or able to hold or acquire our common stock, transactions in our common stock could be delayed and securities analysts\u2019 and news media coverage of us may be reduced. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of common stock. Listing on the OTC rather than on a major stock exchange could also make our common stock substantially less attractive as collateral for loans, for investment by potential financing sources under their internal policies or state and federal securities laws or as consideration in future capital raising transactions.\nFurthermore, the listing on the OTC rather than a stock exchange may have other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, partners and employees. Our OTC status may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to comply with state and federal securities laws in connection with future financings, acquisitions or equity issuances to employees and other service providers, thereby making it more difficult and expensive for us to raise capital, acquire other businesses using our stock and compensate our employees using equity.\nWe have adopted and are subject to anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company and could prevent or make it more difficult to replace or remove current management\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may constrain or discourage a third party from acquiring or attempting to acquire control of us. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, such provisions could also prevent or make it more difficult for our stockholders to replace or remove current management and could adversely affect the price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts, business combinations or management changes that stockholders consider in their best interest. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of our preferred stock (Preferred Stock). Our Board of Directors has the authority to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of Preferred Stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible financings, acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, even if the transaction might be desired by our stockholders. Provisions of Delaware law applicable to us could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless conditions set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law are met. The issuance of Preferred Stock or Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law could also be deemed to benefit incumbent management to the extent that these provisions deter offers by persons who would wish to make changes in management or exercise control over management. Other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a takeover attempt or management changes that our stockholders might consider in their best interest. For example, our bylaws limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors and fill vacancies on our Board of Directors. Our bylaws also impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors and prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings or acting by written consent.\nIf earthquakes and other catastrophic events strike, our business may be negatively affected\nOur corporate headquarters, including our research and development and pilot plant operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster such as an earthquake would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we were able to use the equipment at our contract manufacturing site we could conduct our pilot plant operations although we would incur significant additional costs and delays in our product development timelines.\nWe face the risk of a decrease in our cash balances and losses in our investment portfolio\nOur investment policy is structured to limit credit risk and manage interest rate risk. By policy, we only invest in what we view as very high quality debt securities, such as U.S. government securities. However, the recent uncertainties in the credit markets, including the recent downgrade by Standard & Poor\u2019s of the U.S. debt rating, could negatively affect our ability to liquidate our positions in securities that we currently believe constitute high quality investments and could also result in the loss of some or all of our principal if the issuer of such securities defaults on its credit obligations. The ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by\nmany factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates, which are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. The outlook for our investment income is dependent on the future direction of interest rates and the amount of cash flows from operations, if any, that are available for investment. Any significant decline in our investment income or the value of our investments as a result of falling interest rates, deterioration in the credit of the securities in which we have invested or general market conditions, could harm our ability to liquidate our investments, our cash position and our income.\nWe are subject to risks related to our information technology systems and the information gathered in our clinical trials\nWe rely on information technology systems in order to conduct business, including internal and external communications, ordering materials for our operations, storing operational information and maintaining and reporting our results. These systems are vulnerable to interruption or failure due to the age of certain of our systems, viruses, malware, security breaches, fire, power loss, system malfunction and other events, which may be beyond our control. Systems interruptions or failures could reduce our ability to develop our products or continue our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nAdditionally, federal and state laws governing our ability to obtain and, in some cases, to use and disclose data we need to conduct research activities, including our clinical trials, could increase our costs of doing business. These laws\u2019 requirements could further complicate our ability to obtain necessary research data from our collaborators. In the event that our systems are breached and certain clinical data is compromised, we could become subject to costs arising from failure to maintain the privacy of protected health information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights or breached our privacy obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 79703, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "INSV"}
