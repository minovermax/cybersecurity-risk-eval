You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information provided to you in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information in the section of this document entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the SEC.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers, our business and results of operations will be affected adversely.\nTo succeed, we must continue to attract and retain customers and increase sales to new and existing customers. The rate at which new and existing customers purchase and renew subscriptions to our products depends on a number of factors, including those outside of our control. In future periods, our total customers and revenue could decline or grow more slowly than we expect.\nWe rely on a variety of methods to attract new customers, such as paying providers of online services, search engines, directories and other websites to provide content, advertising banners and other links that direct prospects to our website, television and radio advertising, the efforts of our partners and the inclusion of a link to our website in substantially all of our customers\u2019 emails. In addition, we are committed to providing our customers with a high level of support. As a result, we believe many of our new customers are referred to us by existing customers. However, customers cancel their accounts for many reasons, including economic concerns, business failure, credit card failure, the timeliness and success of product enhancements and introductions by us\nand those of our competitors, the pricing offered by us and our competitors, the frequency and severity of any system outages and technological change or a perception that they do not use our products effectively, the service is not a good value and that they can manage their online marketing efforts without our products. In some cases, we terminate an account because the customer fails to comply with our standard terms and conditions.\nOur future success also depends on retaining our current customers at acceptable retention levels. As our customer base continues to grow, even if our customer retention rates remain the same on a percentage basis, the absolute number of customers we lose each month will increase. We must continually add new customers to replace customers whose accounts are cancelled or terminated, which may involve significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate. If the cost of our marketing initiatives were to significantly increase or our efforts to satisfy our existing customers are not successful, we may not be able to attract new customers or retain existing customers on a cost-effective basis and, as a result, our business and results of operations would be affected adversely.\nBeginning in April 2014, we formally launched Constant Contact Toolkit, our integrated online marketing platform. We have relatively little experience selling an integrated product and currently, we are not offering the product to all of our prospects. To the extent that offering this integrated platform leads to a decline in the number of customers or a decline in revenue, or negatively impacts our existing customers or our existing products, which still account for a significant majority of our revenue, or results in higher customer attrition, or causes our executives and employees to have to expend time and resources to support two different offerings, our business and results of operations may be affected adversely.\nOur business is substantially dependent on the market for email marketing services for small organizations.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from our email marketing product for small organizations, including small businesses, associations and non-profits. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, revenue from our email marketing product alone was approximately 80% and 84%, respectively, of our total revenue. In addition, email marketing is the most prominent offering within our Toolkit product. Widespread acceptance of email marketing among small organizations will continue to be critical to our future growth and success. There is no certainty regarding how the market for email marketing will continue to develop, or whether it will experience any significant contractions. Our ability to attract and retain customers will depend in part on our ability to make email marketing convenient, effective and affordable. If small organizations determine that email marketing does not sufficiently benefit them or utilize alternative or new electronic methods of communicating with their customers, existing customers may cancel their accounts and potential customers may decide not to adopt email marketing. If the market for email marketing services fails to continue to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our services may decline and our revenue would suffer.\nOur growth strategy requires us to expand our product offerings beyond email marketing and this expansion may not be successful.\nWe have traditionally focused our business on providing our email marketing product for small organizations, but over the last several years we have significantly expanded our product offerings. Our efforts to introduce new products beyond our email marketing product or to offer a bundled offering of two or more of our products, such as Toolkit, may not result in significant revenue growth, may not be complementary to our email marketing product, may not be timely, may divert management resources from our existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business or product or may be confusing to our customers, any of which may harm our financial performance and impede our long-term growth strategy.\nIf the security of our customers\u2019 confidential information stored in our systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, our reputation may be severely harmed, we may be exposed to liability and we may lose the ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option.\nOur system stores our customers\u2019 proprietary email contacts lists, credit card information, personally identifiable information and other critical data. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could expose us to liability for the loss of such information, adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity, which could severely damage our reputation. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers\u2019 data, our relationships with our customers will be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and our third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, as we continue to grow our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become a more inviting target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, and we could lose customers and fail to acquire new customers. Further, any mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various federal government agencies, including the FTC and state and local agencies. The United States and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information of individuals, and the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Self-regulatory obligations, other industry standards, policies, and other legal obligations may apply to our collection, distribution, use, security or storage of personally identifiable information or other data relating to individuals. In addition, the federal government and many states, including Massachusetts, have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements or our internal practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with United States, European Union or other foreign privacy or security laws, policies, industry standards or legal obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect or use information that we utilize to provide targeted advertising to our customers, thereby impairing our ability to maintain and grow our total customers and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our customers\u2019 data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such information limit our ability to develop new products and features.\nIn addition, failure to maintain compliance with the data protection policy standards adopted by the major credit card issuers may limit our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option. Any loss of our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option would harm our reputation and make our products less attractive to many small organizations by negatively impacting our customer experience and significantly increasing our administrative costs related to customer payment processing.\nOur existing general liability insurance may not cover any, or cover only a portion of any, potential claims related to security breaches to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all or any portion of liabilities that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage would increase our operating expenses and reduce our net income.\nUnited States federal legislation and the laws of many foreign countries impose certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails, which could minimize the effectiveness of our products, particularly our email marketing product, and establish financial penalties for non-compliance, which could increase the costs of our business.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. The CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from the sender. In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act, particularly Utah and Michigan, which have enacted do-not-email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content, such as adult or other harmful products. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. The ability of our customers\u2019 constituents to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our products. Moreover, non-compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act carries significant financial penalties. If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act, or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email such as the laws of Canada and the United Kingdom, whether as a result of violations by our customers or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be required to pay penalties, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business, and our reputation would suffer. We also may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers or could increase our operating costs.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive and rapidly changing, and the barriers to entry are relatively low. In addition, this market is highly fragmented with some vendors providing part of the solution or addressing specific solutions or segments of the market. Given our broad product offering, we compete with both point-solutions and broader solution providers. With the introduction of new technologies and the influx of new entrants to the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, limit customer attrition and maintain our prices.\nOur principal email marketing competitors include providers of email marketing products for small to medium size businesses such as AWeber Systems, Inc., iContact Corporation, a subsidiary of Cision, Inc., Protus, a subsidiary of j2 Global, Inc. (Campaigner), The Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp), VerticalResponse, Inc., a subsidiary of Deluxe Corporation, and Cimpress N.V. (VistaPrint). These vendors typically charge a low monthly fee or a low fee per number of emails sent and, in some cases, they have a free offering. Competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our email marketing product to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. In addition, there are a number of other vendors that are focused on providing email marketing products for larger organizations, including Alterian, a subsidiary of SDL, plc, CheetahMail, Inc., a subsidiary of Experian Group Limited,\nExactTarget, Inc., a subsidiary of Salesforce.com, Inc., Responsys Inc. and Eloqua Limited, subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation, Silverpop, an IBM Company, and StrongMail Systems, Inc. While we do not compete in a significant way with vendors of email marketing products serving larger customers, we may compete with these providers in the\nfuture. Finally, our email marketing product experiences some competition from ISPs, web hosting companies, advertising and direct marketing agencies and other large established businesses, possessing large, existing customer bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels. If these companies decide to further invest in and develop, market or resell competitive email marketing products, acquire one of our larger competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our operating results could be harmed.\nOur other products also face intense competition. EventSpot, our event marketing product, competes with offerings by Eventbrite, Inc., Evite, LLC, a wholly-owned, operating business of IAC/InterActiveCorp, Regonline, a division of Lanyon Solutions Inc., and Cvent, Inc. Our Social Campaigns product competes with offerings by Offerpop Corporation and Pagemodo, a subsidiary of Cimpress N.V. Our survey product competes with similar offerings by Surveymonkey.com Corporation and Widgix, LLC doing business as SurveyGizmo. Our SaveLocal product competes with offerings by Groupon, Inc., LivingSocial, Inc., Amazon Local and Googleoffers. Our SinglePlatform product competes with offerings by Yext, Inc. and Locu Inc., a subsidiary of GoDaddy.com, LLC. In addition, our bundled product offerings, including Toolkit, could face competition from new competitors who are different from the companies we currently compete with on our individual products.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our current and potential competitors may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have. In addition, these companies may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have and may be able to bundle email marketing, event marketing or survey products with other products that have already gained widespread market acceptance and offer them at no cost or low cost. These competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. In an attempt to gain market share, competitors may offer aggressive price discounts or alternative pricing models on the products they offer, such as so-called \u201cfreemium\u201d pricing in which a basic offering is provided for free with advanced features provided for a fee. As a result, increased competition could result in lower sales, price reductions, reduced margins and the loss of market share. If we are unable to compete with these companies and their offerings, the demand for our products could substantially decline.\nAny significant disruption in service on our website or in our computer systems, or in our customer support services, could result in a loss of customers.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, level of customer service, reputation and ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, worms, other malicious software programs, illegal or abusive content or similar disruptive problems caused by our customers, employees, consultants or other Internet users who attempt to invade or disrupt public and private data networks. In the past, we have been subject to distributed denial of service, or DDOS, attacks by hackers intent on disrupting our products, and we may be subject to DDOS attacks or other abuse in the future.\nIn providing our services, we also rely on third-party hosting facilities, bandwidth providers, ISPs and mobile networks. Our production system hardware and the disaster recovery operations for our production system hardware are co-located in third-party hosting facilities. These facilities do not guarantee that our customers\u2019 access to our products will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Our operations also depend on the ability of our third-party hosting facilities to protect their and our systems against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality, temperature, humidity and other environmental concerns, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events. In addition, our customer support services, which are located at our headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts and at our sales and support office in Loveland, Colorado, would experience interruptions as a result of any disruption of electrical, phone or any other similar facility support services.\nOur production disaster recovery system is located at one of our third-party hosting facilities. Our corporate disaster recovery system is located at our headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts. These systems do not provide real-time backup and neither system may have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage and we cannot guarantee that our backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent network and service interruption, system failure, damage to one or more of our systems or data loss. In the event of a disaster in which our production system hardware and the disaster recovery operations for our production system hardware are irreparably damaged or destroyed, we would experience interruptions in access to our products. Moreover, our headquarters and one of the third-party facilities that hosts our production system hardware are located within several miles of each other. As a result, any regional disaster could affect these locations equally.\nAny interruptions or delays in access to our products or customer support, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters, security breaches or malicious actions, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and our reputation and lead to liability. These factors could damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees\u2019 attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause customers to cancel their accounts, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to enhance our existing products, develop new products or offer a bundle of our products that our customers and prospective customers find compelling, our products may become obsolete or less competitive and our financial performance could be impacted.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by constant change and innovation, and we expect them to continue to evolve rapidly. To the extent we are not able to continue to identify challenges faced by small businesses and organizations and provide products that respond in a timely and effective manner to their evolving needs, or if we are unable to enhance our existing products successfully, including our recent enhancements to our contact management functionality and our plans to update our editing environment, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nCreating and designing such enhancements and new products entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead-time, and there is no guarantee that such enhancements and new products will be completed in a timely fashion, nor is there any guarantee that any new product offerings will anticipate our customer\u2019s needs or gain acceptance among our customers or in the broader market. In addition, such enhancements and new products may not be profitable for a number of years, if at all, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. Our existing customers and prospective new customers may be dissatisfied with our enhancements to our existing products and may leave us or choose competing providers, or may not view any new product as complementary to our other product offerings and not purchase such additional products.\nWe must continue to commit significant resources to develop our technology in order to maintain our competitive position, and these commitments will be made without knowing whether such investments will result in products the market will accept. Our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain meaningful market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in releasing new products or product enhancements to the market;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately predict market demand or customer preferences;\n\u2022\ndefects, errors or failures in product design or performance;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about product performance or effectiveness;\n\u2022\nintroduction of competing products (or the anticipation thereof) by others;\n\u2022\npoor business conditions for our customers or poor general macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe perceived value of our products or product enhancements relative to their cost; and\n\u2022\nchanging regulatory requirements adversely affecting the products we offer.\nSimilarly, if we offer a bundle of our products, such as Toolkit, that our customers and prospective customers do not find compelling, our business will also be harmed. Creating, designing and marketing these packages (and converting our current customer base to these new packages) entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures, lead-time and management attention, and there is no guarantee that such packages will anticipate our customers\u2019 needs or gain acceptance among our customers or in the broader market.\nIf we cannot successfully enhance our existing services or develop new products or if we are not successful in implementing such enhancements and selling new products or new packages of our products to our customers, we could lose customers or have difficulty attracting new customers, which would adversely impact our financial performance.\nOur relationships with our partners may not be as successful in generating new customers as we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to increase our customer base.\nWe maintain a network of different types of partners, some of whom refer customers to us through links on their websites and outbound promotion to their customers, resell our products and create integrations with our products. We have invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance our partners\u2019 effectiveness; however, these programs could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. We also rely on some of our partners to create integrations with third-party applications and platforms used by our customers. If we fail to encourage our partners to create such integrations or if we do not adequately facilitate these integrations from a technology perspective, demand for our products could decrease, which would harm our business and operating results. If we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing partners or establish new contractual relationships with potential partners, we may experience delays and increased costs in adding customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The number of customers we are able to add through these relationships is dependent on the marketing efforts of our partners over which we exercise very little control, and a significant decrease in the number of new customers generated through these relationships or failure of our investment in partner programs to be effective could adversely affect the size of our customer base and revenue.\nThird parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, claims that we are infringing their intellectual property, which, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or require us to obtain expensive licenses, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties, including so-called non-practicing entities, which are entities that have no operating business but exist purely as collectors of patents, have asserted, and in the future may assert, patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication. These claims, whether or not successful, could:\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nresult in costly and time-consuming litigation;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nin the case of open source software-related claims, require us to release our software code under the terms of an open source license; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign our software and services to avoid infringement.\nAs a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business. In addition, many of our agreements with our partners and others require us to indemnify them for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us resulting from an adverse ruling on any such claim. Even if we have not infringed any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful, and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time. Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.\nIf the delivery of our customers\u2019 emails is limited or blocked or our customers\u2019 emails are directed to an alternate or \u201ctabbed\u201d section of the recipient\u2019s inbox, customers may cancel their accounts.\nISPs can block emails from reaching their users. While we continually improve our own technology and work closely with ISPs to maintain our deliverability rates, the implementation of new or more restrictive policies by ISPs may make it more difficult to deliver our customers\u2019 emails. In addition, some ISPs have started to categorize as \u201cpromotional\u201d emails that originate from email service providers and, as a result, direct them to an alternate or \u201ctabbed\u201d section of the recipient\u2019s inbox. If ISPs materially limit or halt the delivery of our customers\u2019 emails, or if we fail to deliver our customers\u2019 emails in a manner compatible with ISPs\u2019 email handling or authentication technologies or other policies, or if the open rates of our customers\u2019 emails are negatively impacted by the actions of ISPs to categorize emails, then customers may question the effectiveness of our products and cancel their accounts. This, in turn, could harm our business and financial performance.\nIf we fail to promote and maintain our brands in a cost-effective manner, we may lose market share and our revenue may decrease.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the Constant Contact brands in a cost-effective manner is critical to our goal of achieving widespread acceptance of our online marketing platform and attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our industry increases. Successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the effectiveness and affordability of our products for our target customer demographic. Historically, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense, and it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur additional significant expenses. Such brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and, even if they do, any revenue increases may not offset the expenses we incur to promote our brands. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands successfully, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may lose our existing customers to our competitors or be unable to attract new customers, which would cause our revenue to decrease.\nWe depend on search engines to attract a significant percentage of our customers, and if those search engines change their listings or our relationship with them deteriorates or terminates, we may be unable to attract new customers, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMany of our customers located our website by clicking through on search results displayed by search engines such as Google\u00ae, Yahoo! \u00ae and Bing\u00ae. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchased listings. Algorithmic listings cannot be purchased, and instead are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Purchased listings can be purchased by advertisers in order to attract users to their websites. We rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract a significant percentage of the customers we serve to our website. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search result listings. If search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, this could result in fewer potential customers clicking through to our website, requiring us to resort to other costly resources to attempt to replace this traffic, which, in turn, could reduce our revenue and negatively impact our operating results, harming our business. If one or more search engines on which we rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us, our expenses could rise, or our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. The cost of purchased search listing advertising fluctuates and may increase as demand for these channels grows, and any such increases could negatively affect our financial results.\nFurthermore, competitors may in the future bid on our brand names and other search terms that we use to drive traffic to our websites. Such actions could increase our advertising costs and result in decreased traffic to our website.\nMobile devices are increasingly being used to access the Internet, and our products may not be as effective when accessed through these devices, which could harm our business.\nWe offer our products across a variety of operating systems and through the Internet. Historically, we designed our products for use on a desktop or laptop computer; however, mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are increasingly being used as the primary means for accessing the Internet. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with third-party mobile devices and mobile operating systems, as well as web browsers that we do not control. Any changes in such devices, systems or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our products could adversely affect usage of our products. In addition, because a growing number of our customers access our products through mobile devices, we are dependent on the interoperability of our products with mobile devices and operating systems. Improving mobile functionality is an integral component of our product development plans. In the event that our customers have difficulty accessing and using our products on mobile devices, our customer growth, business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of email as a communications tool and the related expansion and reliability of the Internet infrastructure. If consumers do not continue to use email or alternative communications tools gain popularity, such as social media or text messaging, demand for our email marketing product may decline.\nThe future success of our business depends on the continued and widespread adoption of email as a primary means of communication. Security problems such as \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms\u201d and other malicious programs or reliability issues arising from outages and damage to the Internet infrastructure could create the perception that email is not a safe and reliable means of communication, which would discourage businesses and consumers from using email. Use of email by businesses and consumers also depends on the ability of ISPs to prevent unsolicited bulk email, or \u201cspam,\u201d from overwhelming consumers\u2019 inboxes. In recent years, ISPs have developed new technologies to filter unwanted messages before they reach users\u2019 inboxes. In response, spammers have employed more sophisticated techniques to reach consumers\u2019 inboxes. Although companies in the anti-spam industry have started to address the techniques used by spammers, if security problems become widespread or frequent or if ISPs cannot effectively control spam, the use of email as a means of communication may decline as consumers find alternative ways to communicate. In addition, if alternative communications tools, such as social media or text messaging, gain widespread acceptance, the need for email may lessen. Any decrease in the use of email would reduce demand for our email marketing product and harm our business.\nVarious private spam blacklists have in the past interfered with, and may in the future interfere with, the effectiveness of our products and our ability to conduct business.\nWe depend on email to market to and communicate with our customers, and our customers rely on email to communicate with their customers and members. Various private entities attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation. These entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam. Some of these entities maintain \u201cblacklists\u201d of companies and individuals, and the websites, ISPs and Internet protocol addresses associated with those entities or individuals, that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate. If a company\u2019s Internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any Internet domain or Internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity\u2019s service or purchases its blacklist.\nSome of our Internet protocol addresses currently are listed with one or more blacklisting entities and, in the future, our other Internet protocol addresses may also be listed with these and other blacklisting entities. There can be no guarantee that we will not continue to be blacklisted or that we will be able to successfully remove ourselves from those lists. Blacklisting of this type could interfere with our ability to market our products and services and communicate with our customers and could undermine the effectiveness of our customers\u2019 marketing campaigns, all of which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers\u2019 use of our products and website to transmit negative messages or website links to harmful applications in violation of our policies or otherwise could damage our reputation, and we may face liability for unauthorized, inaccurate or fraudulent information distributed via our products.\nOur customers could use our products or website to transmit negative messages or website links to harmful applications, reproduce and distribute copyrighted material or the trademarks of others without permission, or report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information. Any such use of our products could damage our reputation and we could face claims for damages, copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence or fraud. Moreover, our customers\u2019 promotion of their products and services through our products may not comply with federal, state and foreign laws. We cannot predict whether our role in facilitating these activities would expose us to liability under these laws. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for our customers\u2019 activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nOur customers\u2019 use of our SaveLocal product may negatively impact our reputation and could subject us to legal and regulatory risks, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur brand and reputation may be harmed by our customers\u2019 use of our SaveLocal product. Any shortcomings of one or more of our SaveLocal customers, particularly with respect to an issue affecting the quality of the deal offered or the products or services sold or such customer\u2019s fraudulent or deceptive conduct, may be attributed to us, potentially damaging our reputation and brand value, reducing our ability to attract new customers or retain our current customers and subjecting us to potential liability, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations.\nThe application of certain United States and international laws and regulations to SaveLocal deals and to our role in facilitating our customers\u2019 offer of SaveLocal deals is uncertain. These include laws and regulations such as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or the CARD Act, the laws of most states, which contain provisions governing product terms and conditions of gift cards, gift certificates, stored value or pre-paid cards or coupons, and unclaimed and abandoned property laws. These laws may include provisions prohibiting or limiting the use of expiration dates on gift cards or the amount of fees charged in connection with gift cards or requiring specific disclosures on or in connection with gift cards and the imposition of certain fees.\nIf we are required to alter our business practices as a result of any laws or regulations, our revenue could decrease, our costs could increase and our business could otherwise be harmed. In addition, the costs and expenses associated with defending any actions related to such additional laws and regulations and any payments of related penalties, judgments or settlements could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, if any laws or regulations require that the face value of SaveLocal coupons have a minimum expiration period beyond the period desired by our SaveLocal customers for their promotional programs, or no expiration period, this may affect the willingness of our customers to use our SaveLocal product in jurisdictions where these laws apply.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by seasonal trends.\nSales of our products are impacted by seasonality. Small organizations are typically less active during the summer months. Thus, we generate fewer new customers during this time. As a result, we adjust our sales and marketing activities accordingly. If these seasonality trends change materially, our financial and operating results for any given quarter may be negatively impacted and may differ materially from results in prior quarterly periods.\nCompetition for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees whom we need to support our business.\nCompetition for highly skilled engineering and marketing personnel is intense and we continue to face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel in certain areas of our business and in certain locations. We may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. In particular, candidates making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology industries, often consider the value of any equity they may receive in connection with their employment. As a result, any significant volatility in the market price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled engineering and marketing personnel.\nIn addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements and the quality of our services and our ability to serve our customers could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe success of our SinglePlatform offering is based, in part, on the quality of the content provided by our SinglePlatform customers, including our SingleAPI merchants, and our ability to maintain a strong network of publishers.\nOur SinglePlatform customers, including our SingleAPI merchants, provide us with current information about their business and offerings that we, in turn, provide to our network of electronic publishers, including but not limited to Yelp, foursquare, YP.com and Urbanspoon. The success of the SinglePlatform and SingleAPI offerings depend, in part, on our ability to provide these publishers and their consumers with the information and access to the services or products they seek, which in turn depends on the quantity and quality of the content and services provided by these customers. For example, we may be unable to provide these publishers and their consumers with the information they seek if our customers do not contribute content or services that are helpful, reliable and up-to-date, or if they remove content they previously submitted. If our SinglePlatform products do not provide content that is helpful, reliable and up-to-date or access to services that end users are interested in using, our ability to maintain our current network of electronic publishers and sign up new publishers could be harmed. If we are unable to provide our electronic publishers and their consumers with the information or services they seek, or if they can find equivalent content or services on other platforms, they may stop or reduce their use of our product, which could negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers and obtain new customers and merchants and our business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our success also depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key technical and marketing personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. In particular, Gail F. Goodman, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is critical to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction. The loss of the services of Ms. Goodman or other executive officers or key personnel and the process to replace any of our key personnel would involve significant time and expense, may take longer than anticipated and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nWe may be subject to time-consuming and costly litigation.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits by partners, customers, or other parties arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits alleging patent infringement. We are currently a party to the actions that are described in Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, the results of any of these actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions may negatively affect the small business sector, which may cause our customers to terminate existing accounts with us or cause potential customers to fail to purchase our products, resulting in a decrease in our revenue and impairing our ability to operate profitably.\nOur products are designed specifically for smaller organizations. These organizations frequently have limited budgets and are often resource- and time-constrained and, as a result, may be more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than their larger, more established counterparts. As a result, smaller organizations may choose to spend the limited funds that they have on items other than our products. Moreover, if smaller organizations experience economic distress, they may be unwilling or unable to expend time and financial resources on marketing, which would negatively affect the overall demand for our products, increase customer attrition and could cause our revenue growth to decline. Uncertain and adverse economic conditions may also lead to a decline in the ability of our customers to use or access credit, including through credit cards, as well as increased refunds and chargebacks, any of which could adversely affect our business. Economic conditions may also adversely affect third parties with which we have entered into relationships and upon which we depend in order to grow our business. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions, or a recurring recession, will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, processes and know-how and trade secrets, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how and trade secrets. Although we try to protect this information in part by executing confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, such agreements may offer only limited protection and may be breached. Any unauthorized disclosure or dissemination of our proprietary technology, processes and know-how or our trade secrets, whether by breach of a confidentiality agreement or otherwise, may cause irreparable harm to our business, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, processes and know-how or our trade secrets are disclosed, the value of our technology and services could be adversely affected, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or others intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in scope. Furthermore, it is possible that our patent applications may not issue as granted patents, that the scope of our issued patents will be insufficient or not have the coverage originally sought, that our issued patents will not provide us with any competitive advantages, and that our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. In addition, issuance of a patent does not assure that we have an absolute right to practice the patented invention, or that we have the right to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our issued patents effectively.\nCompetitors and others may have adopted, and in the future may adopt, tag lines or service or product names similar to ours, which could impede our ability to build our brands\u2019 identities and possibly lead to confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the terms or designs of one or more of our trademarks.\nFrom time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others. Any inability on our part to protect adequately our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe incorporate open source software into our products. Although we monitor our use of open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by United States or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue sales of our products, or to release our software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. Given the nature of open source software, there is also a risk that third parties may assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs.\nOur anticipated growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our anticipated growth, we may not be able to implement our business plan successfully.\nWe are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management and our administrative, operational and financial reporting infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our senior management to manage this expected growth effectively. To do so, we believe we will need to continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and update our reporting procedures and systems. The expected addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth successfully, we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully.\nProviding our products to customers outside the United States exposes us to risks inherent in international business.\nCustomers in more than 180 countries and territories currently use our products. We have two regional development directors in Canada and a marketing office in the United Kingdom. We may continue to expand our international operations in the future. Accordingly, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States. The risks and challenges associated with providing our products to customers outside the United States include:\n\u2022\nlocalization of our products, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to tax, email, privacy and data protection;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and maintaining foreign operations; and\n\u2022\nregional economic and political conditions.\nIf we fail to meet these risks and challenges, we will be unable to execute our business plan and may be subject to fines and regulatory actions. Furthermore, expansion of our international operations may not be commercially successful.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting, we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. We expect to continue to incur such expenses and expend such time in the future. If in the future we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price could decline substantially.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\naverage revenue per customer;\n\u2022\nour cost to acquire new customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing or product bundling;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute successfully on our strategy;\n\u2022\nnew product and service introductions, including Toolkit;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or interruptions in our services as a result of our actions or those of third parties;\n\u2022\nthe timing of additional investments in our hardware and software systems;\n\u2022\nthe seasonal trends in our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in the growth rate of small businesses and organizations;\n\u2022\nany negative publicity or other actions that harm our brand;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our marketing expenditures;\n\u2022\ncompetition in the market for our products;\n\u2022\nshortcomings in, or misinterpretations of, our metrics and data that cause us to fail to anticipate or identify market trends;\n\u2022\nterminations of, disputes with, or material changes to our relationships with third-party partners;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with future acquisitions of technologies and businesses and our ability to successfully integrate these acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.\nAny one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results, including our key financial and operating metrics. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our revenue or operating results expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for any period. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we may be unable to mitigate the negative impact on operating results in the short term. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, our business and stock price could be materially and adversely affected and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSome of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them may cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe have completed several acquisitions in the past, including our most recent acquisition of SinglePlatform Corp. in June 2012. We have, from time to time, evaluated other acquisition opportunities and may pursue acquisition opportunities in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nan inability to locate a suitable acquisition candidate or technology or acquire a desirable candidate or technology on favorable terms;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating personnel and operations from the acquired business or acquired technology with our existing technology and products and in retaining and motivating key personnel from the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our ongoing operations and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities associated with operating our business;\n\u2022\nincreases in our expenses that adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\npotential write-offs of acquired assets and increased amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired; and\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt.\nIn addition, any acquisitions we complete may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, or such an acquisition may be viewed negatively by our customers, stockholders or the financial markets.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and may dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nWe have historically relied on cash from operations to fund our operations, capital expenditures and growth. We may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to:\n\u2022\nfund our operations;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures;\n\u2022\ntake advantage of strategic opportunities, including more rapid expansion of our business or the acquisition of complementary products, technologies or businesses; and\n\u2022\ndevelop new products or enhancements to existing products.\nWe may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with credit card and other online payment chargebacks and fraud.\nA majority of our revenue is processed through credit cards and other online payments. If our refunds or chargebacks increase, our processors could require us to increase reserves or terminate their contracts with us, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur failure to limit fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as through the use of stolen credit card numbers, could also subject us to liability. Under credit card association rules, penalties may be imposed at the discretion of the association for inadequate fraud protection. Any such potential penalties would be imposed on our credit card processor by the association. Under our contracts with our payment processors, we are required to reimburse our processors for such penalties. However, we face the risk that we may fail to maintain an adequate level of fraud protection and that one or more credit card associations or other processors may, at any time, assess penalties against us or terminate our ability to accept credit card payments or other forms of online payments from customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nquarterly unique customer additions and the cost of acquiring those customers and customer retention rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us; and\n\u2022\nthe total number of shares of our common stock that have been sold short.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to litigation that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nThere can be no assurance that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash and cash equivalents.\nIn July 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $30 million of our common stock through July 31, 2015. Under the repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares in the open market, which may include the use of 10b5-1 trading plans, or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our stock repurchase program will diminish our cash and cash equivalents, which may reduce our flexibility with respect to future activities, including acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Among other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to impede or delay a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92302, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "CTCT"}
