{"cik": "1012771", "company": "FBL FINANCIAL GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors\nThe performance of our company is subject to a variety of risks which you should review. Occurrence of these risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nChanging interest rates, market volatility and general economic conditions affect the risks and the returns on both our products and our investment portfolio.\nThe fair value of our investments and our investment performance, including yields and realization of gains or losses, may vary depending on economic and market conditions. The shape of the yield curve and the level of interest rates can impact the profitability of our products. Interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure. Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can materially affect the profitability of our products, the fair value of our investments and the reported value of stockholders' equity.\nA key component of our financial results is the spread earned (the investment yield we earn less the crediting rates we pay to our policyholders). A narrowing of spreads would adversely affect operating results. Although we have the right to adjust interest crediting rates on a portion of our business in force, changes to crediting rates may not be sufficient to maintain targeted investment spreads in all economic and market environments. Our ability to lower crediting rates is subject to contractual minimum crediting rate guarantees. In addition, competition and other factors, including the potential for increases in surrenders and withdrawals, may limit our ability to adjust or maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid the narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions.\nConversely, in periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek financial instruments with higher investment returns, commonly referred to as disintermediation. This may lead to net cash outflows and the resulting liquidity demands may require us to sell investments when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses.\nSee \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risks of Financial Instruments\" for further discussion of our interest rate risk exposure and information regarding our asset-liability management program.\nDifficult conditions in the financial markets and the economy may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy and financial markets. Below-average global growth and low market interest rates continue to challenge the life insurance and annuity industry. While the U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, growth is slowing across much of the rest of the global economy. In the financial markets, liquidity, corporate profitability and modest economic growth continue to support fundamental credit quality. However, challenging economic conditions outside of the U.S. and strong demand for U.S. assets have restrained interest rates broadly, challenging growth in investment income and resulting in declining portfolio investment yields across the life insurance and annuity industry.\nOur business benefits from moderate to strong economic expansion. Conversely, a lackluster economic recovery characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower consumer spending, muted corporate earnings growth and lower business investment could adversely impact the demand for our products in the future. In addition, a significant portion of our customer base operates in the agricultural industry; accordingly, fluctuation in commodity prices, federal subsidies and the value of farm land may impact our customers' demand for our insurance and investment products. We also may experience a higher incidence of claims, lapses or surrenders of policies following such fluctuations. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, or what impact such actions could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAdverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our liquidity, access to capital and cost of capital.\nCapital requirements depend on factors including the rate of sales growth of our products, aggregate reserve levels and the levels of risks in our insurance products and invested assets. In order to meet these capital requirements, we may need to\nincrease or maintain Farm Bureau Life's statutory capital and surplus through additional financings, which could include debt, equity or other transactions.\nAdverse capital market conditions may affect the availability and cost of borrowed funds, thereby ultimately impacting our profitability and ability to support or grow our businesses. Without sufficient capital, we could be forced to curtail certain of our operations, and our business could suffer. Actions we might take to access financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.\nWe manage our capital level to be consistent with statutory and rating agency requirements. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate that Farm Bureau Life has sufficient capital to meet our rating objectives. However, this capital may not be sufficient if significant future losses are incurred and access to additional capital is limited.\nOur valuation of fixed maturity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nDuring periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment or market conditions.\nCertain market sectors may become dislocated during and after periods of volatile and illiquid market conditions, increasing the difficulty in valuing certain instruments, as trading becomes less frequent and/or market data less observable. As a result, certain valuations may require greater estimation and judgment as well as more complex valuation methods. These values may not ultimately be realizable in a market transaction, and such values may change rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified.\nThe decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment is determined in part by our assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security as well as an evaluation of our intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell prior to recovery. Our conclusions regarding the recoverability of a particular security's fair value may ultimately prove to be incorrect as facts and circumstances change.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to credit quality risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our profitability and reported book value per share.\nParticularly in the event of a major downturn in economic activity, we are subject to the risk that issuers of fixed maturity securities, other debt securities and commercial mortgage borrowers, will default on principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2015, we held $6.6 billion of fixed income securities, $0.2 billion of which represented below-investment grade holdings. Of these below-investment grade holdings, 91.4% were acquired as investment grade holdings but, as of December 31, 2015, had been downgraded to below investment grade. An increase in defaults on our fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loan portfolios could harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.\nAlthough we seek to diversify the investment portfolio across multiple asset classes, industries and geographies, the concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe face competition from companies having greater financial resources, more advanced technology systems, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance, which may impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability and financial strength.\nSee \"Item 1. Business - Ratings and Competition\" for information regarding risks relating to competition.\nAs a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries for funds to meet our obligations, but our life insurance subsidiaries' ability to make distributions to us is limited by law, and could be affected by minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nAs a holding company, we rely on dividends from subsidiaries to assist in meeting our obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other cash payments in the future may materially affect our ability to satisfy our parent company payment obligations, including debt service and dividends on our common stock.\nThe amount of dividends we have available to pay our common shareholders is limited to a certain extent by the amount of dividends our primary operating subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life, is able to pay to its parent, FBL Financial Group, Inc. Farm Bureau Life's ability to pay dividends to FBL Financial Group, Inc. is limited by law to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus) as of the date the dividend is paid, as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities of the State of Iowa. At December 31, 2015, Farm Bureau Life\u2019s statutory unassigned surplus was $469.6 million. There are certain additional limits to the amount of dividend that may be paid within a year without approval of the Insurance Division, Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa (the Iowa Insurance Division) as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. During 2016, the maximum amount available for distribution to FBL Financial Group, Inc. from Farm Bureau Life without regulatory approval is $100.0 million.\nIn addition, Farm Bureau Life is subject to the risk-based capital (RBC) requirement of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) set forth in the Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act (the Model Act). The main purpose of the Model Act is to provide insurance regulators a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. U.S. insurers and reinsurers are required to report the results of their RBC calculations as part of the statutory annual statements filed with state insurance regulatory authorities. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital ratio, a measure of solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC based on various risk factors related to an insurance company's capital and surplus, including insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. The insurance regulators impose regulatory actions when a company's total adjusted capital is equal to or lower than 200% of its authorized control level risk-based capital. The severity of regulatory actions increase until the point where regulators assume control of an insurance company when its total adjusted capital is equal to or less than 70% of its authorized control level risk-based capital.\nFailure to maintain adequate capital levels could lead to ratings downgrades and liquidity issues which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nA significant ratings downgrade may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. If our ratings were lowered, our ability to access reinsurance and market products to new customers could be harmed and existing policyholders might cancel their policies or withdraw the cash values of their policies. These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity. Our ratings reflect the agency's opinions as to our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to Farm Bureau Life's policyholders. There is no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be reduced, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency, if in the rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. See \"Item 1. Business - Ratings and Competition\" for a summary of our current ratings.\nAll segments of our business are highly regulated and these regulations or changes in them could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to statutes and regulations in various states in which our life insurance subsidiaries operate. Insurance regulation is different in each state, but is similar in that it is intended to provide safeguards for policyholders, agents, insurance companies and their holding companies. State insurance regulators oversee matters relating to the business of life insurance and annuities, such as sales practices, policy forms, claims practices, types and amounts of investments, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, minimum amounts of capital and surplus, transactions with related parties, changes in control and payment of dividends. They continually examine existing laws and regulations, and may recommend or make changes as they see appropriate.\nOur variable insurance products, investment advisors, broker/dealer and certain licensed agents who are also registered representatives and investment advisor representatives are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), state securities regulators (in most states where they are authorized to do business) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\nAs noted above, through adoption by law in states where we do business, our life insurance subsidiaries are subject to the NAIC's RBC requirements. These guidelines are used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify deteriorating or weakly capitalized insurance companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. Our life insurance subsidiaries also may be required under solvency or guarantee laws of most states in which they do business, to pay assessments up to certain prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses for insolvent insurance companies.\nAlthough the federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance, our company is subject to the same federal laws as other corporations, including, but not limited to pension regulation, discrimination, financial services regulation,\nsecurities regulation and federal taxation. Any one of these regulatory schemes can significantly affect the insurance business. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of Treasury to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend prudential standards and represent the U.S. in dealings with foreign insurance regulators. We continue to monitor the activities of the FIO, NAIC and the state insurance regulators.\nAs part of the Dodd-Frank Act, many key rules have yet to be finalized, some of which might have an impact on insurers. The regulatory framework at the state and federal level applicable to our insurance products is evolving and could affect the design of our products and our ability to sell certain products. Any changes in these laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur investment management subsidiary is an SEC-registered investment advisor. This entity manages the investment portfolios for certain non-affiliated organizations, as well as oversees financial advisory services provided by our agent force. Our registered separate accounts are themselves highly regulated under the Investment Company Act. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the SEC and is subject to regulation under the Exchange Act and various state securities laws, and is a member of and subject to regulation by FINRA. Registered representatives sell variable products and mutual funds through our broker/dealer subsidiary and are regulated by FINRA and state securities regulators. The failure of our broker-dealer subsidiary and registered representatives to acquire and maintain required securities registrations and comply with SEC and FINRA regulations could materially impact our business reputation and subject the company to financial penalties.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. This includes the current work by accounting standards setting bodies on a project evaluating the accounting for insurance contracts. While the scope of this project was scaled back in 2014, it is uncertain what the outcome of the project will be or when it will be completed. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) proposed regulations addressing when a person providing investment advice with respect to certain employee benefit plans or individual retirement accounts (IRA) is considered a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed regulations offer a very broad definition of fiduciary investment advice which includes services currently offered to some of our customers with such plans or IRAs. The DOL has also proposed a new set of prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs) and amendments to existing PTEs to permit certain common fee and compensation practices to continue. Under the proposal the agents who sell fixed annuities and the registered representatives who sell variable annuities or investment products for use in certain employee benefit plans or IRAs, could subject themselves and one or more of our companies to additional disclosures, reporting, record keeping and other regulatory requirements. It is not uncommon for our customers to utilize products we offer in such plans and the proposals could have an adverse impact on our operations. It is uncertain if the proposals will be adopted in their current form and the impact of the proposed regulations on our organization is uncertain at this time.\nCyber attacks, system security risks, data protection breaches and other technology failures could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA technology failure could occur and potentially disrupt our business, damage our reputation and adversely affect our profitability. Our information technology systems are subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access or cyber attacks. The administrative and technical controls and other preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology systems may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. In addition, disruptions or breaches could occur as a result of natural disasters, man-made disasters, epidemic/pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, criminal activity, technological changes or events, terrorism or other unanticipated events beyond our control. Any compromise of the security of our technology systems that results in the inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses. While the company has insurance intended to provide coverage from certain losses related to such incidents and a variety of preventative security measures such as risk management, information protection, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, we cannot predict the method or outcome of every possible cyber incident. Unanticipated problems with our systems or recovery plans could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, our results of operations and our financial position.\nActual experience which differs from our assumptions regarding future persistency, mortality and interest rates used in pricing our products and calculating reserve amounts and deferred acquisition costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe process of pricing products and calculating reserve amounts and deferred acquisition costs for an insurance organization involves the use of a number of assumptions including those related to persistency (how long a contract stays with the company), mortality (the relative incidence of death in a given time) and interest rates (the rates expected to be paid or received on financial instruments, including insurance or investment contracts). Actual results could differ significantly from those assumed. Actual experience which differs from one or more of these assumptions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeferred acquisition costs (DAC) include certain direct costs of successfully acquiring new insurance business, including commissions and other expenses related to the production of new business, to the extent recoverable from future policy revenues and gross profits. Bonus interest credited to contracts during the first policy year is also included. We amortize these costs over the expected lives of the contracts. We test the DAC recorded on our consolidated balance sheet to determine if these amounts are recoverable under current assumptions. In addition, we regularly review the estimates and assumptions underlying DAC for those products for which we amortize DAC in proportion to gross profits. Given changes in facts and circumstances, these tests and reviews could lead to reductions in DAC that could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition. Increases in actual or expected future withdrawals or surrenders or decreases in expected future investment returns, which are more likely in a severe economic recession, would result in an acceleration of DAC amortization. In addition, significant or sustained equity and bond market declines could result in an acceleration of DAC amortization related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts.\nOur earnings are influenced by our claims experience, which is difficult to estimate for future periods. If our future claims experience does not match our pricing assumptions or past results, our earnings could be materially adversely affected.\nOur earnings are significantly influenced by the claims paid under our insurance contracts and will vary from period to period depending upon the amount of claims incurred. There is only limited predictability of claims experience within any given quarter or year. The liability that we have established for future insurance and annuity policy benefits is based on assumptions concerning a number of factors, including interest rates, expected claims, persistency and expenses. In the event our future experience does not match our pricing assumptions or our past results, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur reinsurance program involves risks because we remain liable with respect to the liabilities ceded to reinsurers if the reinsurers fail to meet the obligations assumed by them.\nWe reinsure a portion of our life insurance exposure with unaffiliated insurance companies under traditional indemnity reinsurance agreements. New sales of life products are reinsured above prescribed limits and do not require the reinsurer's prior approval within certain guidelines. We enter into indemnity reinsurance arrangements to assist in diversifying our risks and to limit our maximum loss on risks that exceed our policy retention limits. Our maximum retention limit on an insured life ranges up to $1.5 million depending upon when the policy was issued.\nIndemnity reinsurance does not fully discharge our obligation to pay claims on the reinsured business. As the ceding insurer, we remain responsible for policy claims to the extent the reinsurer fails to pay claims. Should any reinsurer fail to meet the obligations assumed under such reinsurance, we remain liable, and payment of these obligations could result in losses.\nOur business is highly dependent on our relationships with Farm Bureau organizations and could be adversely affected if those relationships became impaired.\nFarm Bureau Life's business relies significantly upon the maintenance of our right to use the Farm Bureau and FB trade names and related trademarks and service marks which are controlled by the American Farm Bureau and state Farm Bureau organizations. See discussion under \"Item 1. Business - Marketing and Distribution - Affiliation with Farm Bureau\" for information regarding these relationships and circumstances under which our access to the Farm Bureau membership base and use of the \"Farm Bureau\" and \"FB\" designations could be terminated. The loss of the right to use these designations in a key state or states could have a material adverse effect on operating results.\nOur relationship with Farm Bureau organizations could result in conflicts of interests.\nOur business and operations are interrelated to a degree with that of the American Farm Bureau and its affiliates, and state Farm Bureau organizations and their affiliates. The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life, share common directors with the state Farm Bureau organizations and their affiliates. Farm Bureau Life has written agreements with the state Farm Bureau organizations which cover the use of the Farm Bureau name and logo in their respective states. Farm Bureau Life also has written service agreements with affiliates of these state Farm Bureau organizations covering the management of our shared distribution in those states. Negotiation and approval of those agreements may give rise to conflicts of interest for those who serve on the boards of directors of both parties to such agreements. Conflicts could also arise with respect to other business dealings among the parties.\nThe Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life, have comparable agreements with Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Company. With respect to those agreements, in addition to individuals who serve as directors on the boards of both companies, the Company, Farm Bureau Life and Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Company have common executive management, which may give rise to conflicts of interest for those executives.\nChanges in federal tax laws may affect sales of our products and profitability.\nThe annuity and life insurance products that we market generally offer income tax advantages to policyholders as compared to other savings instruments, such as certificates of deposit and taxable bonds. Current federal income tax law allows for the deferral of income tax on the earnings during the accumulation period of certain annuity or insurance policies, as opposed to the current taxation of other savings instruments. In addition, life insurance death benefits are generally exempt from income tax. Legislation eliminating this tax deferral or tax exemption, or changes to reduce the taxation of competing products, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nCongress has from time to time considered legislation that would increase the amount of income tax expense incurred by insurance companies, including proposals to reduce the deduction for dividends received on assets held in separate accounts to support variable products. Reduction or elimination of federal tax credits for low-income housing and disallowing deductions for certain executive compensation have also been discussed as a potential means to reduce federal budget deficits. To the extent legislation were enacted that includes any of these items, we would incur additional income tax expense, thereby reducing earnings. Additionally, the amount of tax currently due could be accelerated significantly by provisions modifying the tax treatment of life insurance reserves, policy acquisition costs, depreciation and market discount on bonds. The likelihood of enactment of any of these proposals and any adverse consequences they may cause us is uncertain.\nOur ability to maintain competitive costs is dependent upon the level of new sales and persistency of existing business.\nMaintaining competitive costs depends upon numerous factors, including the level of new sales, persistency of existing business and expense management. A decrease in sales or persistency without a corresponding reduction in expenses could affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain agents, sales of our products and services may be reduced.\nWe compete to attract and retain exclusive agents for Farm Bureau Life. Intense competition exists for persons with demonstrated ability. We compete primarily on the basis of our reputation, products, compensation, support services, rating agency ratings and financial position. Sales and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents.\nAttracting and retaining employees who are key to our business is critical to our growth and success.\nThe success of our business and the ability to reach goals is dependent, to a large extent, on our ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition is intense in the job market for certain positions, such as actuaries and other insurance professionals with demonstrated ability, particularly with our headquarters being located in central Iowa, a hub of insurance company home offices, where we compete with other insurance and financial institutions.\nOur employees are not subject to employment contracts, except for a retention agreement with our Chief Executive Officer. There can be no certainty regarding the length of time any of our named executive officers will remain with us. Our inability to retain our key employees, or attract and retain additional qualified employees, could materially adversely affect our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nSuccess of our business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements.\nOur business is dependent upon effective technology for interacting with employees, agents, policyholders, vendors, third parties and investors. It is crucial to our business to reach a large number of people and secure, store and provide sizable amounts of information. If we do not maintain adequate systems to reflect technological advancements, we could experience adverse consequences including inadequate pricing, underwriting and reserving decisions, regulatory problems, security breaches or litigation exposure. This could adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients and make it difficult to attract new customers.\nOur business strategy involves providing customers with easy-to-use products and systems to meet their needs, and our information systems require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards. We are continuously enhancing and updating our systems to keep pace with changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, threats and customer demands. A failure to provide customers with information systems they need to conduct business with us could negatively impact relationships with our customers.\nOur business is dependent, in part, upon third-party software and services for some of the above-listed technology needs. If one of our third-party vendors is unable to provide the service we require, there could be adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer, agent, reporting, regulatory and other operational needs.\nOur success is dependent on protecting, maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of existing systems, as well as continuing to buy or build information systems that support our business processes in a cost-effective manner. An inability to provide and maintain effective information technology systems could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks relating to litigation, including the costs of such litigation, management distraction and the potential for damage awards, which may adversely impact our business.\nWe are occasionally involved in litigation, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff. In addition, state regulators such as the Iowa Insurance Division, and federal regulators such as the SEC, FINRA, DOL and the Internal Revenue Service, are entitled to make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and laws governing the activities of broker-dealers. Companies in the life insurance and annuity business have faced litigation, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper product design, improper sales practices and similar claims. Moreover, we are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our exclusive agents, such as fraud, non-compliance with policies and recommending transactions that are not suitable for particular customers. While we are currently not a party to any lawsuit that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, there can be no assurance that any litigation will not have such an effect, whether financially, through distraction of our management or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 83720, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "FFG"}
