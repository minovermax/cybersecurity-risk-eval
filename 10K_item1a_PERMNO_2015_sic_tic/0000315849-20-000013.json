RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock and the Corporation\u2019s financial results are subject to a number of risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those generally affecting the industry in which the Corporation operates and risks that management currently deems immaterial, may arise or become material in the future and affect the Corporation\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to the Corporation\nAs a bank holding company, adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nWeaknesses or adverse changes in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which the Corporation operates could adversely impact our business, including causing one or more of the following negative developments:\n\u00b7 a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Corporation;\n\u00b7 a decrease in the value of the Corporation\u2019s loans secured by consumer or commercial real estate;\n\u00b7 an impairment of the Corporation\u2019s assets, such as its intangible assets, goodwill, or deferred tax\nassets; or\n\u00b7 an increase in the number of customers or other counterparties who default on their loans or other\nobligations to the Corporation, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net\ncharge-offs and provision for loan losses.\nOne or more negative developments resulting from adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment, some of which are described above, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to raise capital could be limited, affect its liquidity, and could be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on the Corporation\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to borrow funds or successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to existing shareholders.\nCapital resources and liquidity are essential to the Corporation\u2019s businesses and it relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Corporation\u2019s businesses. We depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers. Sources of funding available to us, and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy, include traditional and brokered deposits, inter-bank borrowings, Federal Funds purchased, repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We may also raise funds from time to time in the form of either short-or long-term borrowings or equity issuances. The Corporation\u2019s capital resources and liquidity could be negatively impacted by disruptions in its ability to access these sources of funding. The cost of brokered and other out-of-market deposits and potential future regulatory limits on the interest rate we pay for brokered deposits could make them unattractive sources of funding. Further, factors that we cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, could impair our ability to access sources of funds. Other financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy generally and there may not be a viable market for raising short or long-term debt or equity capital. In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed if the Corporation is downgraded or put on (or remains on) negative watch by the rating agencies, suffers a decline in the level of its business activity or regulatory authorities take significant action against it, among other reasons.\nAmong other things, if we fail to remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes, because we do not qualify under the minimum capital standards or the FDIC otherwise downgrades our capital category, it could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, and our ability to make acquisitions, and we would not be able to accept brokered deposits without prior FDIC approval. To be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d, a bank must generally maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% and total risk-based capital ratio of 10%. In addition, our regulators may require us to maintain higher capital levels. Our failure to remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or to maintain any higher capital requirements imposed on us could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Corporation is unable to raise funding using the methods described above, it would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets to meet maturing liabilities. The Corporation may be unable to sell some of its assets, or it may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and depends on subsidiary service fees and dividends from the Bank to fund its payment of dividends to its shareholders and of interest and principal on its outstanding debt. The Bank is also subject to other laws that authorize regulatory authorities to prohibit or reduce the flow of funds from the Bank to the Corporation. Any inability of the Corporation to pay its obligations, or need to defer the payment of any such obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and the value of our common stock.\nThe Corporation\u2019s construction and land development loans are subject to unique risks that could adversely affect earnings.\nThe Corporation\u2019s construction and land development loan portfolio was $28.8 million at December 31, 2019, comprising 7.2% of total loans. Construction and land development loans are often riskier than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. In the event of a general economic slowdown, they would represent higher risk due to slower sales and reduced cash flow that could impact the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay on a timely basis. As a result, these loans could represent higher risk due to slower sales and reduced cash flow that affect the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay on a timely basis which could result in a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRecent performance may not be indicative of future performance.\nVarious factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, competition and the ability to find and retain talented people, may impede the Corporation\u2019s ability to remain profitable.\nDeterioration in asset quality could have an adverse impact on the Corporation.\nA significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of diverse real and personal property that may be affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, environmental contamination and other external events. In addition, decreases in real estate property values due to the nature of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio, over 75% of which is secured by real estate, could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans. The Bank\u2019s loan policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect the results of operations of the Corporation and the value of its assets.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, known as the interest rate spread, is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the level of nonperforming assets. Fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for the Corporation\u2019s products and services. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities may re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than interest-earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. On March 3, 2020 the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 1.00 to 1.25 percent citing evolving risks to economic activity from the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) (discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and in Part II, Item 7 under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments\u201d), and on March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve further lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent citing related concerns about the disruption to economic activity and stress in the energy sector. A prolonged period of very low interest rates could reduce our net interest income and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, the discontinuance of LIBOR as a reference rate, and the uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the value of reference rate-linked debt securities that we hold or issue, which could further impact our interest rate spread and impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the level of interest rates may also negatively affect the value of the Corporation\u2019s assets and its ability to realize book value from the sale of those assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings.\nThe phase-out or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLIBOR is an interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for a wide range of our financial instruments. In July 2017, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time (and if so, what reference rate will replace it) or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in contracts that are currently indexed to United States dollar LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to financial and other derivative contracts exposed to LIBOR. Uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.\nThese reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past and could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the disappearance of LIBOR and transition to a new method or benchmark could:\n\u00b7 adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, and the value of the Corporation\u2019s floating rate obligations, loans and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u00b7 prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate;\n\u00b7 result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language, or the absence of such language, in LIBOR-based securities and loans;\n\u00b7 result in customer uncertainty and disputes around how variable rates should be calculated in light of the foregoing, thereby damaging our reputation and resulting in a loss of customers and additional costs to us; and\n\u00b7 require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the Corporation\u2019s risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, and the effect on the Corporation\u2019s funding costs, loan, and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset liability management and business is uncertain.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reported financial results depend on the accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation, the application of which requires significant assumptions, estimates and judgments.\nThe Corporation\u2019s accounting and reporting policies are fundamental to the methods by which we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation\u2019s management must make significant assumptions and estimates and exercise significant judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting and reporting policies so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select a policy from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, which may result in the Corporation reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nIf the Corporation\u2019s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings would decrease.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant loan losses which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses inherent in the portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, management relies on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information. As a result of these considerations, the Corporation has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Corporation recorded an allowance for possible loan losses of $3.60 million, compared with $3.43 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. If these assumptions are incorrect, the allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of the Bank\u2019s loan customers, third party service providers and employees.\nWhen the Bank makes loans to individuals or entities, they rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant\u2019s loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower\u2019s net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While they attempt to verify information provided through available sources, they cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. The Bank\u2019s reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s profitability or financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nTechnology difficulties or failures or cyber security breaches of our network security could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.\nThe Corporation depends upon data processing, software, and communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks. The computer platforms and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cyber security issues. The Corporation cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to cyber-attack or other technological difficulties or failures. The Corporation relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Corporation could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customers and expose us to claims from customers.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Although we have security measures designed to mitigate the possibility of break-ins, breaches and other disruptive problems, including firewalls and penetration testing, there can be no assurance that such security measures will be effective in preventing such problems.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is subject to the success of the local economies and real estate markets in which it operates and susceptible to an economic downturn.\nThe Corporation\u2019s banking operations are located in southwest Georgia. Because of the geographic concentration of its operations, the Corporation\u2019s success depends largely upon economic conditions in this area, which include volatility in the agricultural market, influx and outflow of major employers in the area, and minimal population growth throughout the region. Deterioration in economic conditions in the communities in which the Corporation operates could adversely affect the quality of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation is less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of more diverse economies.\nMoreover, if economic conditions were to worsen nationally, regionally or locally, then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, the demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. An increase in our non-performing assets and related increases in our provision for loan losses, coupled with a potential decrease in the demand for loans and our other products and services, could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations and future growth. Our customers may also be adversely impacted by changes in regulatory, trade (including tariffs) and tax policies and laws, or a global health crisis or pandemic, all of which could reduce demand for loans and adversely impact our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay our loans. In addition, international economic uncertainty could also impact the U.S. financial markets by potentially suppressing stock prices, including ours, and adding to overall market volatility, which could adversely affect our business. The effects of any economic downturn could continue for many years after the downturn is considered to have ended.\nThe Corporation may face risks with respect to its ability to execute its business strategy.\nThe financial performance and profitability of the Corporation will depend on its ability to execute its strategic plan and manage its future growth. Moreover, the Corporation\u2019s future performance is subject to a number of factors beyond its control, including pending and future federal and state banking legislation, regulatory changes, unforeseen litigation outcomes, inflation, lending and deposit rate changes, interest rate fluctuations, increased competition and economic conditions. Accordingly, these issues could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. On March 3, 2020 the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 1.00 to 1.25 percent citing evolving risks to economic activity from the COVID-19 (discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and in Part II, Item 7 under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments\u201d), and on March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve further lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent citing related concerns about the disruption to economic activity and stress in the energy sector. A prolonged period of very low interest rates could reduce our net interest income and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Corporation depends on its key personnel, and the loss of any of them could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends to a significant extent on the management skills of its existing executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with the Corporation for many years. The loss or unavailability of any of its key personnel, including DeWitt Drew, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna S. Lott, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer; and Danny E. Singley, Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations or liquidity.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and the Corporation experiences competition in its markets from other depository institutions and other financial service organizations, including brokers, finance companies, financial technology companies, mutual funds, savings and loan associations, credit unions and certain governmental agencies. The Corporation competes with these other financial institutions in attracting deposits and in making loans. Many of its competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions that are able to operate profitably with a narrower net interest margin and have a more diverse revenue base. The Corporation may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread costs across broader markets. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to compete effectively in its markets. Furthermore, developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nIn addition, technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. In addition to better serving our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to respond to future technological changes and the ability to address the needs of our customers. We address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in our not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner. In addition, complications during a conversion of our core technology platform or implementation or upgrade of any software could negatively impact the experiences or satisfaction of our customers, which could cause those customers to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the amount of business that they do with us, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Third parties upon which we rely for our technology needs may not be able to cost-effectively develop systems that will enable us to keep pace with such developments. As a result, our competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. The inability to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements is uncertain.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules established a common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%, a higher minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 6% and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. In addition, to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d, the rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement of 6.5% or greater and a higher Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 8% or greater. Moreover, the rules limit a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if such banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of a 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the 4.5% minimum common equity Tier 1 requirement and the other amounts necessary to meet the minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe application of the more stringent capital requirements described above could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in additional regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in us modifying our business strategy and could restrict dividends.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal bank regulatory agencies and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision.\nWe compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations. In addition, changes in enacted tax laws, such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets.\nChanges in monetary policy, laws and regulations or failures to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the Corporation.\nFederal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affects credit conditions for the Corporation, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, the Corporation and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which the Corporation conducts its banking business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit holders of the Corporation\u2019s securities. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is in the control of the Corporation. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nIn 2017, both chambers of Congress proposed comprehensive financial regulatory reform bills that would amend the Dodd-Frank Act and that could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In May 2018, certain provisions of these bills were signed into law as part of the Economic Growth Act and repealed or modified significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the Economic Growth Act delayed implementation of rules related to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, reformed and simplified certain Volcker Rule requirements, and raised the threshold for applying enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion to those with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250 billion.\nWhile recent federal legislation, including the Economic Growth Act, has scaled back portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, uncertainty about the timing and scope of such changes, as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime, remains and enactment of any other regulatory relief is uncertain and none of which may lead to a meaningful reduction of our regulatory burden and attendant costs. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nFederal and state regulators have the ability to impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements on the Bank if they determine, upon examination or otherwise, violations of laws, rules or regulations with which we or the Bank must comply, or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include directors\u2019 resolutions, memoranda of understanding, cease and desist or consent orders, civil money penalties and termination of deposit insurance and bank closures. Enforcement actions may be taken regardless of the capital level of the institution. In particular, institutions that are not sufficiently capitalized in accordance with regulatory standards may also face capital directives or prompt corrective action. Enforcement actions may require certain corrective steps (including staff additions or changes), impose limits on activities (such as lending, deposit taking, acquisitions or branching), prescribe lending parameters (such as loan types, volumes and terms) and require additional capital to be raised, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Enforcement actions, including the imposition of monetary penalties, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, and damage to our reputation, and loss of our holding company status. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from our operations, cause us to incur significant expenses, restrict us from engaging in potentially profitable activities, and limit our ability to raise capital. Closure of the Bank would result in a total loss of shareholder investment.\nThe outbreak of the recent COVID-19, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, could cause severe disruptions in the U.S. economy, which could in turn disrupt the business, activities, and operations of our customers, as well as our business and operations. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, including the time such outbreak takes to wane and the time it takes our markets to return to normal, may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us, particularly in the event of a spread of COVID-19 or an outbreak of an infectious disease in our market area. Although we maintain contingency plans for pandemic outbreaks, a spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another contagious disease could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities. Such a spread or outbreak also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for us. The spread of COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, or the failure to contain such spread could have a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of COVID-19 had become pandemic, and on March 13, the U.S. President announced a national emergency relating to the disease. There is a possibility of widespread infection in the United States and abroad, with the potential for catastrophic impact. National, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries, is uncertain. Some economists are predicting the United States will soon enter a recession. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially affect our business, including our customers\u2019 willingness to conduct banking transactions, their ability to pay on existing obligations and the availability of liquidity, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nBecause of the fixed exchange ratio and the fluctuation of the market price of First Bancshares common stock, our shareholders will not know the market value of the merger consideration until they will receive at the effective time of the merger.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, each share of the Corporation\u2019s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 1.00 share of First Bancshares common stock.\nThe market value of the merger consideration may vary from the market value on the date we announced the merger until the date merger is completed and thereafter due to fluctuations in the market price of First Bancshares common stock. Any fluctuation in the market price of First Bancshares common stock will change the value of the shares of First Bancshares common stock that our shareholders may receive. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including but not limited to general market and economic conditions, changes in their respective businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively affect the value of our shares and the future business and financial results of the Corporation.\nIf the merger is not completed, the ongoing business of the Corporation could be adversely affected and we will be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the merger, including the following:\n\u00b7 we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay to First Bancshares a termination fee equal to $3,750,000;\n\u00b7 we have incurred substantial costs in connection with the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, printing and mailing fees;\n\u00b7 the loss of key employees and customers;\n\u00b7 the disruption of operations and business;\n\u00b7 deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss;\n\u00b7 unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit;\n\u00b7 diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while working to implement the merger; and\n\u00b7 reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the merger.\nIf the merger is not completed, these risks could materially affect the business, financial results and the value of the Corporation\u2019s common stock.\nThe Corporation will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Retention of certain employees may be challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us or the combined entity. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, our business or the business assumed by First Bancshares following the merger could be harmed. In addition, we have agreed to certain contractual restrictions on the operation of our business prior to closing which could materially affect the business, financial results and the value of the Corporation\u2019s common stock.\nThe merger agreement limits our ability to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal and requires us to pay a termination fee of $3,750,000 under limited circumstances relating to alternative acquisition proposals.\nUnder the merger agreement, we have agreed not to initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate any alternative business combination transaction or, subject to certain exceptions, participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-public information relating to, any alternative business combination transaction. The merger agreement also provides that we will pay First Bancshares a termination fee in the amount of $3,750,000 in the event that the merger agreement is terminated for certain reasons. These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring the Corporation from considering or making a competing acquisition proposal, even if the potential competing acquirer was prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances under the merger agreement.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions granting both the Corporation and First Bancshares the right to terminate the merger agreement in certain circumstances.\nThe merger agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right, subject to certain exceptions, of either party to terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not completed on or prior to June 30, 2020 (subject to automatic extension to August 31, 2020 if the only outstanding condition to closing is the receipt of regulatory approvals), and the right of the Corporation to terminate the merger agreement, subject to certain conditions, to accept a business combination transaction deemed to be superior to the merger by our board of directors. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement if (i) the average closing price of First Bancshares common stock over the 10 trading days preceding the date that is five days prior to the closing date is less than $26.86, and (ii) the decline in the price of First Bancshares common stock (as measured by the average closing price divided by $33.58) is more than 20% greater than the decline in the KBW Regional Banking Index (KRX) (as measured by dividing the average closing price of the KBW Regional Banking Index over the 10 trading days preceding the date that is five days prior to the closing date by $108.51); provided, however, that First Bancshares has the option, but not the obligation, to adjust the per share cash consideration or the per share stock consideration to prevent the termination of merger agreement.\nIf the merger is not completed, the ongoing business of the Corporation could be adversely affected and the Corporation will be subject to several risks, including the risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe merger is subject to a number of conditions which, if not satisfied or waived in a timely manner, would delay the merger or adversely impact the companies\u2019 ability to complete the transactions.\nThe completion of the merger is subject to certain conditions (some of which having been completed as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), including (1) approval of the merger agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held March 27, 2020; (2) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals for the merger, without the imposition of any material on-going conditions or restrictions, and the expiration of all regulatory waiting periods; (3) the absence of any legal restraint (such as an injunction or restraining order) that would prevent the consummation of the merger; (4) the effectiveness of the registration statement filed by First Bancshares; (5) each party\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion from its respective outside legal counsel, dated the closing date of the merger, confirming the merger qualifies as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; (6) the Plan of Bank Merger in the form attached as Exhibit B to the merger agreement being executed and delivered; (7) the absence of the occurrence of a material adverse effect on SGB or First Bancshares; (8) the Corporation obtaining an actuarial analysis demonstrating that (i) the Corporation\u2019s approximate total liability in respect of its pension plan on a termination basis will not materially exceed $13.8 million and (ii) the difference between such liability and the market value of the assets of the pension plan will not be expected to materially exceed $3.85 million, and (9) other customary closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement.\nWhile it is currently anticipated that the merger will be completed during the second quarter of 2020, there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development or change will not transpire that could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee with respect to the timing of the closing of the merger, whether the merger will be completed at all and when the Corporation shareholders will receive the merger consideration, if at all.\nThe merger may be completed even if the Corporation or First Bancshares experiences adverse changes in its business.\nIn general, either the Corporation or First Bancshares may refuse to complete the merger if the other party suffers a material adverse effect on its business prior to the closing of the merger. However, certain types of changes or occurrences with respect to the Corporation or First Bancshares would not prevent the merger from going forward, even if the change or occurrence would have adverse effects on the Corporation or First Bancshares, including the following:\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting financial institutions and their holding companies generally, or interpretations thereof by courts or governmental entities, if such changes do not have a disproportionate impact on the affected company;\nchanges in GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements generally applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies, if such changes do not have a disproportionate impact on the affected company;\nchanges in global, national or regional political conditions including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism, or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, if such changes do not have a disproportionate impact on the affected company;\nchanges or effects from the announcement of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and compliance by the parties with the merger agreement on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the parties;\nany failure by the Corporation of First Bancshares to meet any internal or published industry analyst projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for any period (but not including the underlying causes thereof);\nchanges in the trading price or trading volume of First Bancshares common stock (but not including the underlying causes thereof unless otherwise specifically excluded); however, the Corporation may terminate the merger agreement if (i) the average closing price of First Bancshares common stock during a specified period prior to closing is less than $26.86 and (ii) First Bancshares common stock underperforms the KBW Regional Banking Index by more than 20%, unless First Bancshares elects to make a compensating adjustment to the exchange ratio; and\nthe impact of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby on relationships with customers or employees, including the loss of personnel subsequent to the date of the merger agreement.\nLitigation in transactions of this type are sometimes filed against the board of directors of either party that could prevent or delay the completion of the merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the merger.\nIn connection with the merger, it is possible that the Corporation shareholders may file putative class action lawsuits against the boards of directors of the Corporation and/or First Bancshares. Among other remedies, these shareholders could seek to enjoin the merger. The outcome of any such litigation would be uncertain. If a dismissal is not granted or a settlement is not reached, such potential lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to the Corporation or First Bancshares. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is consummated may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and market price.\nOn February 28, 2020, the Corporation received a letter on behalf of an alleged shareholder alleging that the Corporation and its directors violated their fiduciary duties including by issuing allegedly misleading disclosures in connection with the merger (the \u201cDemand\u201d). While the Corporation believed that the disclosures set forth in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, dated February 18, 2020 (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d), which was filed by the Corporation with the SEC on February 20, 2020 and mailed on or about February 21, 2020 to the Corporation\u2019s shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 12, 2020, fully complied with applicable law, to resolve the alleged shareholder\u2019s claims and moot the disclosure claims, to avoid nuisance, potential expense, and delay and to provide additional information to the Corporation\u2019s shareholders, the Corporation determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the additional disclosures. In light of the supplemental disclosures, the Demand was withdrawn. For additional information, see the Corporation\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2020.\nThe combined company expects to incur substantial expenses related to the merger.\nThe combined company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with completing the merger and integrating the business and operations of the Corporation and First Bancshares. Although First Bancshares and the Corporation have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of their integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the integration of the businesses following the completion of the merger.\nFollowing the merger, the combined company may be unable to integrate the Corporation\u2019s business with First Bancshares successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated timeframe.\nThe merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent companies, as well as the companies\u2019 subsidiaries. Although the combined company is expected to benefit from certain synergies, including cost savings, the combined company may encounter potential difficulties in the integration process, including:\nthe inability to successfully combine the Corporation\u2019s business with First Bancshares in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the merger, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the merger not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all;\nthe risk of not realizing all of the anticipated operational efficiencies or other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the merger within the expected timeframe or at all;\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nFor all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of the combined company\u2019s management, the disruption of the combined company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in the combined company\u2019s operations, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the combined company to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nWhile the merger is pending the Corporation and following the merger, the combined company, may be unable to retain key employees and customers.\nUncertainties about the effects of the merger may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter for the combined company, and could cause customers and others who work with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the combined company following the merger. Uncertainties about the effects of the merger could cause customers and others who work with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. It is not unusual for competitors to use mergers as an opportunity to target the merging parties\u2019 customers and to hire certain of their employees.\nThe success of the combined company after the merger will depend in part upon its ability to retain key employees. Simultaneous with the execution of the merger agreement, First Bancshares entered into employment agreements with certain key employees of the Corporation, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the completion of the merger. However, key employees may depart either before or after the merger because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the Corporation or, following the merger, the combined company will be able to retain key employees.\nThe voting power of the Corporation shareholders will be diluted by the merger.\nThe merger will result in the Corporation shareholders having an ownership stake in the combined company that is smaller than their current stake in the Corporation. Upon completion of the merger of the Corporation with First Bancshares, we estimate that the Corporation shareholders will own approximately 13.55% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company. Consequently, the Corporation shareholders, as a general matter, will have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the effective time of the merger than they currently exercise over the management and policies of the Corporation.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the merger.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the merger if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger or the effect of the merger on the combined company\u2019s financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition, upon completion of the merger, the Corporation and First Bancshares shareholders will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with a different mix of assets, risks and liabilities. Current shareholders of the Corporation and First Bancshares may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all of their shares of the combined company.", "PERMNO": 83831, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SGB"}
