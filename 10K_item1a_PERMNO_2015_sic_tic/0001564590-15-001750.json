{"cik": "1534287", "company": "BioAmber Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have a limited operating history, a history of losses, anticipate continuing to incur losses for a period of time, and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have only been in existence since October 2008 and, therefore, we have a limited operating history upon which you can base your evaluation of our business. As a result, any assessments of our current business and predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could have been if we had a longer operating history. Since our inception, we have incurred substantial net losses, including net losses of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, and $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect these losses to continue. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including those related to the development, continuation and operation of our additional manufacturing facilities, research, testing and development of new products and the growth of our sales and marketing efforts. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenues in future periods in order to become profitable. We cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nTo achieve profitability, we need to execute our manufacturing expansion strategy, including the construction of our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario.\nWe are currently building our first facility in cooperation with Mitsui in Sarnia, Ontario. We expect this facility to be mechanically complete in the second quarter of 2015, and we began commissioning and start-up in March 2015. We intend to build two additional facilities over the next five years. We have not yet operated a commercial-scale production facility, and our technology may not perform as expected when applied at the scale that we plan or we may encounter operational challenges for which we are unable to devise a workable solution. We can provide no assurance that our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario will be completed on the schedule or within the budget that we intend, or at all. If the construction of our Sarnia facility takes longer than expected, or if we encounter unforeseen issues during construction, testing and operation, we will not be able to sell cost-competitive products within the timeline that we expect, or at all. We terminated our production at the French facility on December 31, 2014, as expected per the ARD agreement, and we estimate our inventory levels of bio-succinic acid as of December 31, 2014 to be adequate to meet expected customer demand during the time period when we are transitioning to our planned Sarnia facility. To the extent customer demand is greater than expected or our transition takes longer than expected, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our customer relationships and commercialization growth may suffer.\nEven if we successfully fund, construct and design our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario, there is no guarantee that this facility will produce at full capacity, and even if we do meet these goals, we may encounter operational challenges for which we are unable to devise a workable solution or which may result in additional costs. In addition, our technology may not perform as expected when applied at our planned scale and any resulting adjustments to our process may result in additional costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. To date, we have entered into agreements that contemplate, but do not obligate, us to supply approximately 47,000 metric tons of bio-succinic acid and its derivatives until the end of 2017, and we are actively seeking to enter into additional supply agreements. These supply agreements obligate our customers to exclusively fulfill their needs for bio-succinic acid from us, contingent on our ability to meet their price and other requirements, however there are no penalties in the event they do not purchase or we do not supply them with bio-succinic acid in the projected purchase volumes they have indicated in the agreements. Without increasing our production capacity by completing our Sarnia and other future facilities, we will not be able to\nproduce sufficient amounts of bio-succinic acid to deliver the full amounts contemplated by these agreements and execute on our growth strategy.\nWe have entered into a take-or-pay agreement with Vinmar which requires us to supply bio-succinic acid to them. In the event that we are unable to supply Vinmar reliability with succinic acid according to the terms of our agreement, due to production or quality issues other than a force majeur, we would incur financial penalties payable to Vinmar.\nThe funding, construction and operation of our future facilities involve significant risks.\nWe have limited experience constructing a manufacturing facility of the type and size required to produce commercial quantities of chemicals, and doing so is a complex and lengthy undertaking that requires sophisticated, multi-disciplinary planning and precise execution. The funding, construction and operation of manufacturing facilities are subject to a number of risks, any of which could prevent us from executing on our expansion strategy. In particular, the construction costs associated with future facilities may materially exceed budgeted amounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We estimate the initial phase of the Sarnia, Ontario plant will cost approximately $125.0 million, and will be mechanically completed in the second quarter of 2015. However, we may suffer construction delays or cost overruns, which may be significant, as a result of a variety of factors, such as labor and material shortages, defects in materials and workmanship, adverse weather conditions, transportation constraints, construction change orders, site changes, labor issues and other unforeseen difficulties, any of which could delay or prevent the completion of our planned facilities. As a result, we may not be able to expand our production capacity and product portfolio as quickly as we planned. While our goal is to negotiate contracts with engineering, procurement and construction firms that minimize risk, any delays or cost overruns we encounter may result in the renegotiation of our construction contracts, which could increase our costs.\nIn addition, the construction of our facilities may be subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Such agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on a production facility that could potentially prevent construction from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. If construction costs, or the costs of operating and maintaining our manufacturing facilities, are higher than we anticipate, we may be unable to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may also encounter new design and engineering or operational challenges as we seek to expand the range of organisms and feedstocks we use. Any design and engineering or operational issues at our future facilities may result in diminished production capacity, increased costs of operations or periods in which our facilities are non-operational, all of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We intend to obtain and maintain insurance to protect against some of the risks relating to the construction of new projects. However, such insurance may not be available or adequate to cover lost revenues or increased costs if we experience construction problems, cost overruns or delays. If we are unable to address these risks in a satisfactory and timely manner, we may not be able to implement our expansion strategy as planned or at all. In addition, in the event that our products are defective or have manufacturing failures, we may have to write off and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet internal or external specifications. We also may have to write off work-in-process materials and incur other charges and expenses associated with contamination and impurities should they occur.\nOur failure to comply with milestone covenants contained in certain of our agreements, including certain debt instruments, government grants and government loans, could result in events of default, and if not cured, would require their accelerated or immediate repayment, in which case our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to make such repayments or fund our manufacturing expansion strategy.\nThe terms of our debt instruments require us to comply with various milestone covenants related to the construction and start-up of our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of these debt instruments which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. In addition, we are party to certain agreements with governmental entities that provide grants and loans in connection with the construction of our planned Sarnia facility. If we fail to meet any of the milestones and project goals contained in these grant and loan agreements, we may not receive additional grant installments, may be forced to repay grants received or the repayment of the loans may be accelerated. If additional government grant amounts are withheld or if we are forced to repay amounts under our government loans, our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to make such repayments or fund our manufacturing expansion strategy.\nWe have generated only limited sales of bio-succinic acid to date, are dependent on a limited number of customers and face challenges to developing our business.\nTo date, all our revenue has been derived from the sale of our bio-succinic acid through product and market development efforts related to our bio-succinic acid product, and we have not made sales of any other products. In order to generate sales of our bio-succinic acid and any future products, we must be able to reduce our production costs and produce sufficient quantities of our products, both of which are dependent on our ability to build commercial-scale manufacturing operations. If we are not successful in constructing and operating planned manufacturing facilities or otherwise increasing our manufacturing capacity, developing products that meet our customers\u2019 specifications and further advancing our existing commercial arrangements with strategic partners, we will be unable to generate meaningful revenue from the sale of our products. In addition, we depend, and expect to continue to depend, on a limited number of customers for sales of our bio-succinic acid. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 47% our sales were to International Flavor and Fragrances, Inc., or IFF, Brenntag AG, or Brenntag and Olon Italy. During the year ended December 31, 2013, 64% our sales were to IFF, and Brenntag. In the future, a small number of customers may continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in any given period. We cannot be certain that such customers will consistently purchase our products at any particular rate over any subsequent period. A loss of, or any credit issues related to, any of these customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may not obtain the additional financing we need in order to grow our business, develop or enhance our products or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in the future in order to grow our business. Any required additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to secure financing and the cost of raising such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic and capital markets conditions, credit availability from lenders, investor confidence and the existence of regulatory and tax incentives that are conducive to raising capital. Current turmoil and uncertainty in the financial markets has caused banks and financial institutions to decrease the amount of capital available for lending and has significantly increased the risk premium of such borrowings. In addition, such turmoil and uncertainty has significantly limited the ability of companies to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities. If we are unable to raise additional funds, obtain capital on acceptable terms, secure government grants or co-sponsorships for some of our projects or take advantage of federal and state incentive programs to secure favorable financing, we may have to delay, modify or abandon some or all of our expansion strategies.\nThe amount of any indebtedness that we may raise in the future may be substantial, and we may be required to secure such indebtedness with our assets and may have substantial interest expenses. If we default on any future secured indebtedness, our lenders may foreclose on the facilities securing such indebtedness. The incurrence of indebtedness could require us to meet financial and operating covenants, which could place limits on our operations and ability to raise additional capital, decrease our liquidity and increase the amount of cash flow required to service our debt. If we experience construction problems, cost overruns or delays that adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, we may not be able to fund principal or interest payments under any debt that we may incur.\nBased on our current operating plan, we anticipate that the net proceeds of our public offerings, equity contributions from Mitsui, the loan from Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLP, or TCP, a combination of government grants, interest-bearing and interest-free loans and our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our currently planned operations, including the funding of the construction of our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario. We have no additional committed external sources of funds. Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to halt construction or delay capital expenditures on our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario, and reduce or delay operating expenses as deemed appropriate in order to conserve cash.\nAny effort to sell additional debt or equity securities may not be successful or may not raise sufficient funds to finance additional facilities. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders and the newly-issued securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may need to delay, modify or abandon our expansion strategy and we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our offerings, revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur prior success in developing bio-succinic acid may not be indicative of our ability to leverage our bio-succinic acid technology to develop and commercialize derivatives of bio-succinic acid and other bio-based building block chemicals.\nThe success we have had in manufacturing bio-succinic acid using our four carbon, or C4, platform to date may not be indicative of our future ability to develop and commercialize derivatives of bio-succinic acid, and bio-based six carbon, or C6,\nbuilding block chemicals. Although we expect to be able to leverage our bio-succinic acid technology for use in higher value-added products, we have never produced derivatives of bio-succinic acid or bio-based C6 building block chemicals at commercial scale. We may find that the new chemicals that we produce using our processes are more complex than we anticipated or require processes that we are unfamiliar with or which require larger scale development facilities than expected. The development of new products has required, and will require, that we expend significant financial and management resources. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant research and development expenses. If we are unable to devote adequate resources to develop new products or cannot otherwise successfully develop new products or enhancements that meet customer requirements on a timely basis, our products could lose market share, our revenues and/or margins could decline and we could experience operating losses. Although our management team has significant experience with industrial biotechnology, purification processes and chemical catalysis, the skills and knowledge gained in these fields and in the large-scale production of bio-succinic acid does not guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to cost-effectively produce and commercialize bio-succinic acid derivatives or bio-based C6 building block chemicals at commercial scale.\nIn addition, each of the chemicals that we plan to manufacture are used in multiple and diverse end-markets and applications, each of which present unique requirements, pricing pressures and competitors. As a result, we may not be able to sufficiently serve each end-market adequately. In order to effectively compete in the chemicals industry, we will need to, among other things, be able to adapt our development and production processes to meet the rapidly changing demands of the industry and our customers and ensure that the quality, performance attributes and cost of our bio-based products compare favorably to their petroleum-derived equivalents. In each end-market, there may also be barriers to entry due to third-party intellectual property rights or difficulties forming and maintaining strategic partnerships. In addition, the products currently derived from our processes and the feedstocks we use in the production of bio-succinic acid and our future products, may not be applicable to or compatible with demands in existing or future markets. We may not be able to identify new opportunities as they arise since future applications of any given product may not be readily determinable.\nIf we are not able to successfully develop, commercialize, produce and sell new products, we may be unable to expand our business. Consequently, we may not succeed in our strategy to expand our product platform as expected or at all. If our ability to expand our product platform is significantly delayed or if we are unable to leverage our bio-succinic acid platform as expected, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nDemand for our bio-succinic acid, bio-based 1,4 BDO and other bio-succinic acid derivatives may take longer to develop or be reduced by technological innovations in our industry that allow our competitors to produce them at a lower cost.\nThe development of sufficient customer demand for bio-succinic acid, bio-based 1,4 BDO and other bio-succinic acid derivatives will be affected by the cost competitiveness of our products, and the emergence of more competitive products. The market for bio-based chemicals will require most potential customers to switch from their existing petroleum-based chemical suppliers. In addition, there has been intense growth and interest in bio-based chemicals, and these industries are subject to rapid technological change and product innovation. Our products are based on our proprietary fermentation and purification process, but a number of companies are pursuing alternative processes and technologies and our success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. It is possible that those advances could make bio-succinic acid, bio-based 1,4 BDO and other bio-succinic acid derivatives less efficient or obsolete, causing the renewable chemicals we produce to be of a lesser quality than competing bio-based chemicals or causing the yield of our products to be lower than that for competing technologies. These advances could also allow our competitors to produce bio-based chemicals at a lower cost than ours. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of new technologies by our competitors or the costs associated with such new technologies.\nTechnological breakthroughs in our industry or innovations in alternative sources of bio-based chemicals could reduce demand for our products. Our technologies and products may be rendered uneconomical by technological advances, more efficient and cost-effective biocatalysts or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. If we are unable to adopt or incorporate technological advances or adapt our products to be competitive with new technologies, our costs could be significantly higher than those of our competitors, which could make our facilities and technology less competitive or uncompetitive.\nChanges we make to our business model, product development and manufacturing process, or changes to our commercial partnerships and collaborations may not yield the benefits we expect and may have adverse impacts that we did not anticipate.\nWe are continually working to lower our operating costs, improve our product performance, increase our speed to market and access new markets. As a result, we have made and will continue to make changes we believe will accomplish these goals. For example, we transitioned from an E. coli organism to our yeast for our planned Sarnia facility operations. In addition, we have expanded the breadth of products we are seeking to commercialize, and entered into a number of early stage partnerships and collaborations related to those products, that we believe will significantly increase our accessible market. We can give no assurances that these and other changes we make will yield the benefits we expect and will not have adverse impacts that we did not anticipate. If\nthese changes are not successful, we may incur additional costs, experience reputational and competitive harm and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with strategic partners, licensors, collaborators and other third parties for research and development, the funding, construction and operation of our manufacturing facilities and the commercialization of our products. The failure to manage these relationships could delay or prevent us from developing and commercializing our products.\nWe have built our business largely by forming technology partnerships and licensing and other relationships with market leaders in the industrial biotechnology and chemicals industries. For example, through an exclusive worldwide license from Cargill, we have developed a next-generation yeast microorganism. In addition, we are developing a proprietary purification process that we believe will provide a key cost differentiator to our competitors by reducing the cost profile of our products and the capital intensity of our plants. We have also entered into license agreements with DuPont, entities funded by the DOE, Celexion and others. We expect that our ability to maintain and manage these collaborations will be significant factors in the success of our business.\nAlso, we expect that our ability to maintain and manage partnerships for the funding, construction and operation of our manufacturing facilities will be a significant factor in the success of our business. The large-scale demonstration facility we operate in Pomacle, France is owned by ARD and we are guaranteed 60% the facility\u2019s capacity through a toll-manufacturing agreement with ARD.\nWe have entered into a joint venture agreement with Mitsui for the financing and construction of our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario. We have commenced construction and expect this facility to be mechanically complete in the second quarter of 2015. We may work with Mitsui to build and operate an additional BDO plant in the future. We may not be able to maintain our partnership with Mitsui if it decides not to go forward based on certain rights granted to it in our agreement. Mitsui has the right to sell its shares and we have the obligation to purchase those shares at 100% of the investment value if the cost of the Sarnia facility is greater than $140 million and we cannot provide the additional funds needed to complete the facility. In the event of an occurrence of a dissolution event until December 31, 2020 the same rights apply and Mitsui has the right to sell its shares and we have the obligation to purchase those shares at 100% of the investment value. The dissolution events giving Mitsui this right are: (i) the Sarnia plant not being operational by January 31, 2016, (ii) cumulative losses accrued from 2016 through 2020 exceeding 75% of paid in capital, (iii) no after-tax profit earned in any three consecutive years from 2016 onwards, and (iv) any act of insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar event. Until December 31, 2018, Mitsui in its sole discretion may sell its shares and we must purchase those shares at a discount of 50% to the cumulative investment value.\nWe are working with strategic partners and collaborators through whom we either own or license the technology needed to develop new specialty chemical products. We will rely on these partners to commercialize our products and the success of these relationships will impact the market opportunity and demand for our products across our target end-markets.\nOur partnering or collaboration opportunities could be harmed and our anticipated timelines could be delayed if:\n\u00b7\nwe do not achieve our objectives under our arrangements in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nour existing or potential industry partners become unable, unwilling or less willing to expend their resources on research and development or commercialization efforts with us due to general market conditions, their financial condition, feedstock pricing or other circumstances, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u00b7\nwe disagree with a strategic partner or collaborator regarding strategic direction, economics of our relationship, intellectual property or other matters;\n\u00b7\nwe are unable to successfully manage multiple simultaneous partnering arrangements;\n\u00b7\nour strategic partners and collaborators breach or terminate their agreements with us or fail to perform their agreed activities or make planned equity contributions;\n\u00b7\nour industry partners become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors;\n\u00b7\napplicable laws and regulations, domestic or foreign, impede our ability to enter into strategic arrangements;\n\u00b7\nwe develop processes or enter into additional partnering arrangements that conflict with the business objectives of our other arrangements; or\n\u00b7\nconsolidation in our target markets limits the number of potential industry partners.\nIf any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our strategic partners and collaborators, we may not be able to commercialize our existing and future products, further develop our business or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations. Additionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our industry partners undergo a change of control or assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements.\nOur operations are dependent upon certain raw materials and utilities, principally sugars, hydrogen, steam and electricity, which make us vulnerable to supply availability and price fluctuations.\nWe are vulnerable to the supply availability and price fluctuations of certain raw materials and utilities, principally sugars, hydrogen (in the production of BDO and THF), steam and electricity. In many cases, we do not have long-term supply agreements in place, which may result in supply problems in the future. For example, we have not yet finalized supply agreements for the required feedstock or carbon dioxide for our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario. Our operations may also be adversely impacted by the failure of our suppliers to follow specific protocols and procedures or comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunctions and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Our reliance on third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for sole-source supplies;\n\u2022\nwe may have production delays if products we source from alternative suppliers do not meet our standards;\n\u2022\nwe are not, and do not expect to become, a major customer of most of our suppliers and such suppliers may give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nIn the event one or more of our suppliers are unable to meet our supply demands, we may not be able to quickly replace them or find adequate supply from a different source. Any interruption or delay in the supply of sugars, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, steam or electricity, or our inability to obtain these raw materials and utilities from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers and expand our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of our bio-succinic acid is based in large part on the price of sugars, which can be derived from corn, wheat or other feedstocks. Fluctuations in the commodity prices of sugars or other inputs required in our production processes may reduce our profit margins, especially if we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our output at fixed or predictable prices. The price and availability of sugars or other inputs may be influenced by factors outside of our control, including general economic, market and regulatory factors.\nWe may not be able to successfully introduce new organisms and feedstocks into our processes.\nWe intend to introduce new organisms and feedstocks into our processes and are working to increase our conversion yields, feedstock flexibility, manufacturing efficiency and product range through our research and development efforts and strategic partnerships. In partnership with Cargill, we developed a yeast that we expect will have higher yields and less contamination risk than the E. coli bacterium we used in the French demonstration plant. We may not, however, succeed in adopting our yeast for use in Sarnia for a number of reasons, including our inability to adapt our purification process for our yeast, the failure of our yeast to produce products that meet the quality standards of our customers and a higher than expected production cost as a result of using our yeast. We plan to use our yeast in the Sarnia facility and future facilities. When we do, the transition may not be as seamless as we expect, and our yeast may require different operating conditions or otherwise differ from our expectations. We also plan to expand the range of feedstocks we use from the fermentable sugars from the hydrolysis of starch from a wheat wet mill used in the large-scale demonstration facility in France to fermentable sugars from corn wet mills in our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario.\nWe may face unexpected challenges when we run our second-generation purification process and yeast fermentation process in our Sarnia facility.\nWe have piloted a second-generation purification process through our agreement with a strategic technology partner. We have tested this purification process at our partner\u2019s facility in conjunction with our fermentation processes in France. However, engineering issues, additional costs or other unforeseen obstacles may arise and create delays when we implement the two processes together at a single manufacturing facility.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth and expand our operations successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe have significantly expanded our business since our inception and have grown to 74 full-time employees as of December 31, 2014. We currently conduct our business in several countries, including the United States and Canada, and we expect to continue to expand geographically in the future. We expect our growth to continue and accelerate in connection with our expansion strategy. As our operations continue to expand, we will need to continue to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various\nthird parties. We may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate, manage our expanding operations effectively or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. Managing our anticipated growth and expanding our operations will require us to do, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nenhance our operational, financial and management controls and infrastructure, human resource policies, and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\neffectively scale our operations, including successfully constructing our planned manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\ndiversify our product line to leverage our bio-succinic acid for use in multiple higher value-added products and other bio-succinic acid derivatives, and develop bio-based C6 building block chemicals;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify, recruit, train, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees and continue to retain, motivate and manage our existing employees;\n\u2022\nmaintain partnerships with third parties for the development of our technology, funding and construction of our plants and the commercialization of our products; and\n\u2022\nmaintain and grow our intellectual property portfolio.\nThese enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources, which will place a strain on our operational, financial and management infrastructure. Our future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth and expansion. There are no guarantees we will be able to do so in an efficient or timely manner, or at all. Our failure to effectively manage growth and expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into certain non-binding letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements with future customers and others, and cannot assure you that such arrangements will lead to definitive agreements, which could harm our commercial prospects.\nWe have entered into non-binding letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements with future customers and others. We have also entered several non-binding memoranda of understanding with third parties related to our product development efforts. We cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate final terms and enter into definitive agreements with any of our future customers or others in a timely manner, or at all, and there is no guarantee that the terms of any final, definitive, binding agreement will be favorable to us or reflect the terms currently contemplated under the letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements we have. Delays in negotiating final, definitive, binding agreements could slow the development and commercialization of the products in our pipeline, which could prevent us from growing our business, result in wasted resources and cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.\nWe have signed a binding take-or-pay contract for bio-based 1,4-Butanediol, or BDO, with Vinmar International, which, under the terms of the 15-year master off-take agreement, Vinmar has committed to purchase 100% of the BDO produced in a 100,000 ton per year capacity plant that BioAmber plans to build in North America and commission in 2017. Vinmar also plans to invest in the BDO plant alongside BioAmber. Following the financing, construction and commissioning of the 100,000 ton BDO plant, Vinmar will be obligated to purchase 100% of the BDO produced for 15 years, and BioAmber will be obligated to sell exclusively to Vinmar. As part of the agreement, Vinmar has a right of first refusal to invest in and secure 100% of the off-take from a second BDO plant that BioAmber would build in the future. While this agreement is binding, our inability to finance and construct the BDO plant would relieve Vinmar of its obligation to purchase BDO under the terms of the take-or-pay agreement.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the product specification requirements of our customers or that our products will be accepted by our target customers.\nWe are currently selling our bio-succinic acid to customers today after having met their quality, purity, performance and cost requirements and intend to sell our product to other customers in the chemicals industry. These sales were made in connection with our product and market development efforts. We also intend to expand our market reach with the new products that we are developing as alternatives to the chemicals currently in use. Our potential customers include large specialty chemical companies that have well-developed manufacturing processes for the chemicals they use or pre-existing arrangements with suppliers for the chemical components they need. These potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers during which time they test and certify our products for use in their processes and, in some cases, determine whether products that contain the chemicals produced using our processes satisfy additional third-party specifications. Meeting these suitability standards could be a time-consuming and expensive process and we may invest substantial time and resources into such qualification efforts without ultimately securing approval by our customers. If we are unable to convince our potential customers that our products\nare equivalents of or comparable to the chemicals that they currently use or that using our products is otherwise beneficial to them, we will not be successful in expanding our market and our business will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, agreements for the sale and purchase of our products are customarily subject to the satisfaction of certain technical, commercial and production requirements. These agreements contain conditions that we and our counterparties agree on product specifications for our chemical products and that our products conform to those specifications. If we do not satisfy these contractual requirements, demand for our products and our reputation may be adversely affected.\nIf the recent decline in the price of petroleum and petroleum-based succinic acid and other chemicals continues, the gross margins and or the demand for our products may decrease.\nThe bio-succinic acid we produce is a renewable alternative to petroleum-based succinic acid. Based on our current financial modeling with respect to our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario, we anticipate that if the price of oil falls below $35 per barrel for a sustained period of time and corn prices are $6.50 per bushel or higher, the resulting selling price of our succinic acid would result insignificantly lower gross margins and we may be unable to compete on price with petroleum-based succinic acid products, which would adversely impact our operating results. World prices for oil have fluctuated widely in recent years. For example, during the last five years the market price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil ranged from a low of $44.45 to a high of $112.93 and was $47.05 on March 12, 2015. We expect that prices will continue to fluctuate in the future. Declining oil prices, or the perception of a future decline in oil prices, may adversely affect the prices we can obtain from our potential customers or dissuade potential customers from entering into long-term agreements with us to buy our products.\nSome of our competitors have significantly more experience and resources than we do and technology developed by our competitors could become more commercially successful than our technology, which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share.\nCompetition in the bio-based chemicals business from other chemicals companies is well established, with many substantial entities having well-financed multi-national operations. Our products will compete against those produced by established companies, including a collaborative venture between DSM and Roquette Fr\u00e8res S.A., a collaborative venture between BASF and Purac, Gadiv Petrochemical Industries Ltd. and Kawasaki Kasei Chemicals Ltd. Competition in the bio-based chemicals business is expanding with the growth of the industry and the advent of many new technologies. In addition to competing with new technologies, we also compete against traditional petroleum-derived chemicals, many of which are produced by large companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger companies, due to their better capitalization, will be better-positioned to develop and commercialize new technologies, build new production facilities and to install existing or more advanced equipment, which could reduce our market share and harm our business. In addition, our products will face competition from those produced by early stage companies, including Genomatica, Inc. and Myriant Corporation. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary technologies that cost effectively produce renewable alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals. Some of our competitors are developing new technologies that may be more successful than our technology. These competitors may also have substantially greater production, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do or may benefit from local government programs and incentives that are not available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered less competitive by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility increases of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential markets, which could lead to litigation. In addition, we may be subject to aggressive competitive tactics from our competitors, who may use their strong positions in the market and established relationships with existing suppliers and customers to take measures that negatively affect our ability to compete effectively in this industry. Our inability to maintain our competitiveness and grow our market share may, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals or permits could adversely affect our operations.\nWhile our business currently has all necessary operating approvals material to our current operations, we must obtain and maintain numerous regulatory approvals and permits in order to build and operate our planned manufacturing facilities, including our planned facility in Sarnia, Ontario. Recently, Health Canada confirmed that the microbial strain to be used in Sarnia is Biosafety level 1 organism and neither Health Canada nor Environment Canada found any risk associated with the activities proposed in our notification. This means that BioAmber can import and use its production strain in Sarnia for the manufacturing of bio-based succinic acid under the operational and safety procedures mentioned in its notification.\nHowever in any given jurisdiction, new legislations could be implemented that would require additional or new regulatory approvals. Obtaining necessary approvals and permits could be a time-consuming and expensive process, and we may not be able to obtain them on a timely basis or at all. In the event that we fail to ultimately obtain all necessary permits, we may be forced to delay operations of the facility and the receipt of related revenues or abandon the project altogether and lose the benefit of any development costs already\nincurred, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, governmental regulatory requirements may substantially increase our construction costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with any required regulatory approvals, the operation of our facilities or the sale of our bio-based chemicals could be delayed. For example, many countries require registration of chemicals before they can be distributed in the country, and a failure to register our chemicals would limit our ability to expedite sales into these markets. In addition, we may be required to make capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with increasingly stringent federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nWe are currently building and plan to operate a manufacturing facility in Sarnia, Ontario as well as additional manufacturing facilities in the future. Our international business operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\nhaving to comply with various Canadian, U.S. and other laws, including export control laws.\n\u2022\nchanges in or uncertainties relating to foreign rule and regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022\ntariffs, export or import restrictions, restrictions on remittances abroad, imposition of duties or taxes that limit our ability to move our products out of these countries or interfere with the import of essential materials into these countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on production, sale or export of bio-based chemicals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nimposition of differing labor laws and standards;\n\u2022\neconomic, political or social instability in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nan inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us.\nWe expect that we will begin expanding into other target markets, however there can be no assurance that our expansion plans will be realized, or if realized, be successful. We expect each market to have particular regulatory, feedstock sourcing and funding hurdles to overcome and future developments in these markets, including the uncertainty relating to governmental policies and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us. If we expend significant time and resources on expansion plans that fail or are delayed, our business, reputation and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nNatural or man-made disasters, political, social or economic instability, or occurrence of a catastrophic or disruptive event in any of the areas where our existing or planned manufacturing facilities are located may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe plan to build and operate manufacturing facilities strategically located throughout the world near sources of feedstock and our target markets. The operation of facilities may be harmed by natural or man-made disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, fires, tsunamis, epidemics and nuclear disasters. Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use would be very costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. In addition, telecommunications failures or other systems interruptions, such as computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, at any of the locations in which we do business could significantly disrupt our operations, laboratory processes and delay shipments to our customers. Even in the absence of direct damage to our operations, large disasters, terrorist attacks, systems failures or other events could have a significant impact on our partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 businesses, which in turn could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. Extensive or multiple disruptions in our operations, or our partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 businesses, due to natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn the event any of our facilities are affected by a disaster, we may:\n\u2022\nbe unable to meet the deadlines of our customers;\n\u2022\nexperience disruptions in our ability to manufacture and ship our products and otherwise operate our business, which could negatively impact our business;\n\u2022\nneed to expend significant capital and other resources to address any damage caused by the disaster; and\n\u2022\nlose customers and we may be unable to regain those customers thereafter.\nOur precautions to safeguard our facilities, including insurance and health and safety protocols, may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, our facilities may experience unscheduled downtime or may not otherwise operate as planned or expected, which could have adverse consequences on our business and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe use biological materials and genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, in our production processes and are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture and disposal of these materials. For example, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, and analogous state laws and regulations impose requirements on the production, importation, use and disposal of chemicals and GMOs in the United States. In Canada, similar regulatory programs exist under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. In particular, a regulatory program similar to TSCA requires that Environment Canada to approve the manufacture of any chemical not already included on the Domestic Substances List, or DSL. We have secured approval from Environment Canada for our use of E. coli and the manufacture of our bio-based succinic acid and the derivatives of succinic acid that we plan to commercialize. Environment Canada has recently reviewed our notification dossier with respect to the use of our yeast, and we obtained a favorable response for the importation and manufacture of the yeast microorganism in January 2014. If Environment Canada requires our future C6-based products, to undergo extensive testing, which we currently do not anticipate, securing approval to manufacture such products could potentially be subject to significant delays or costs. In the European Union, we are subject to a chemical regulatory program known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances). Under REACH, we are required to register our products with the European Commission. The registration process requires the submission of information to demonstrate the safety of chemicals as used and could result in significant costs or delay the manufacture or sale of our products in the European Union.\nWe obtained requisite regulatory approvals for use of E. coli in the large-scale demonstration facility we operated in Pomacle, France as well as in our research and development operations in the United States and Canada. In addition, the Cargill yeast we have licensed has been approved for use in the United States for the production of lactic acid. Although we have implemented safety procedures for the disposal of these materials and waste products to comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our safety measures are compliant or capable of eliminating the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, generation, manufacture, or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and the failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, regulatory oversight costs, third party property damage, product liability and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production, or a cessation of operations, and our liability may exceed our total assets. We expect to encounter similar laws and regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to establish production capabilities, and the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, requiring us to change our operations, or imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could impair our research, development or production efforts and harm our business. Similarly, our business may be harmed if initiatives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, which tend to improve the competitiveness of our products relative to petrochemicals, do not become legally enforceable requirements, or if existing legally enforceable requirements relating to greenhouse gases are amended or repealed in the future. The costs of complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe use chemicals and biological materials in our business and are subject to a variety of federal, regional/state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. Although we have implemented safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products, we cannot be sure that our safety measures are compliant with legal requirements or adequate to eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination. In the event of\ncontamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that we will not violate environmental, health and safety laws as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming, and the failure to comply with past, present, or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage, product liability and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Our liability in such an event may exceed our total assets. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could impair our research, development or production efforts and harm our business. Accordingly, violations of present and future environmental laws could restrict our ability to expand facilities, or pursue certain technologies, and could require us to acquire equipment or incur potentially significant costs to comply with environmental regulations.\nLoss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could harm our research and development efforts, delay launch of new products and impair our ability to meet our business objectives.\nOur business involves complex operations spanning a variety of disciplines that demands a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable in the many areas necessary for our operations. While we have been successful in attracting experienced, skilled professionals to our company, the loss of any key member of our management team or key research and development or operational employees, or the failure to attract and retain additional such employees, could slow our development and commercialization of our products for our target markets and executing our business plans. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology-based businesses and the scarcity of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our business. Hiring, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation is a lengthy and expensive process. The market for qualified personnel is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technology and anticipated products. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to support our internal research and development programs or satisfy customer demands for our products. In particular, our product development and research and development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific, technical and operational personnel. Competition for such personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. Substantially all of our employees are at-will employees, which means that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, including those related to product liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, worker\u2019s compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, property damages or civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief. In the event that such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued liability, or at material amounts, the outcome could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nIn addition, payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our liquidity position. In addition, the development, production and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. Our products may contain undetected defects or impurities that are not discovered until after the products have been used by customers and incorporated into products for end-users. This could result in claims from our customers or others, which could damage our business and reputation and entail significant costs to correct. We may also be sued for defects resulting from errors of our commercial partners or unrelated third parties, but any product liability claim brought against us, regardless of its merit, could result in material expense, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business and reputation. Insurance coverage is expensive, may be difficult to obtain or not available on acceptable terms and may not adequately cover potential claims or losses. If claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may go out of business. In addition, insurance coverage may become more expensive, which would harm our results of operations.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may prevent the successful development and commercialization of our products, as well as significantly harm our results of operations and ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and market conditions. The worldwide economy has been experiencing significant economic turbulence, and global credit and capital markets have experienced substantial volatility and disruption. These adverse conditions and general concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international\neconomies could limit our partners\u2019 or potential partners\u2019 ability or willingness to invest in new technologies or capital. Moreover, these economic and market conditions could negatively impact our current and prospective customers\u2019 ability or desire to purchase and pay for our products, or negatively impact our feedstock prices and other operating costs or the prices for our products. Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to address liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. Significant government investment and allocation of resources to assist the economic recovery of various sectors which do not include the bio-based chemical industry may reduce the resources available for government grants and related funding that could assist our expansion plans or otherwise benefit us. Any one of these events, and continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions, could prevent the successful and timely development and commercialization of our products, as well as significantly harm our results of operations and ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nIf we engage in any acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and face numerous potential risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we may acquire additional businesses, assets, technologies, or products to enhance our business in the future. In connection with any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities which would dilute our current stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nassume significant liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and other liabilities, diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective collaborators, customers and/or suppliers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. We do not have experience in managing the integration process and we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, assets, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating, financial and management resources, if at all. The integration process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business, result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the business. Acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls, which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $98.2 million of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. In general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change has occurred after each of our previous issuances of common stock and warrants. In addition, if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change. Furthermore, we operate both in the United States and in certain jurisdictions outside the United States. Our non-U.S. operations in Canada and in Luxembourg may in the future generate taxable income that is subject to income or other taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are conducted. As of December 31, 2014 we had approximately $5.5 million of NOLs in Canada. Each jurisdiction in which we operate may have its own limitations on our ability to utilize NOL or tax credit carryovers generated in that jurisdiction. Also, we generally cannot utilize NOLs or tax credits generated in one jurisdiction to reduce our liability for taxes in any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may be subject to tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate notwithstanding the existence of NOLs or tax credits in other jurisdictions.\nEthical, legal and social concerns about genetically engineered products and processes, and similar concerns about feedstocks grown on land that could be used for food production, could limit or prevent the use of our products, processes and technologies and limit our revenues.\nSome of our processes involve the use of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. The use of GMOs is subject to laws and regulations in many countries, some of which are new and some of which are still evolving. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates the commercial use of GMOs as well as potential products from the GMOs. Public attitudes about the\nsafety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetic research and GMOs could influence public acceptance of our technology and products.\nWhile our bacterium licensed from entities funded by DOE has been approved for commercial use in France, the United States and Canada, and has been given the lowest classification in terms of risk, our ability to commercialize this bacterium in other countries and to develop and commercialize new organisms, such as our yeast, could be limited by the following factors:\n\u2022\npublic attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetically engineered products and processes, which could influence public acceptance of our technologies, products and processes;\n\u2022\npublic attitudes regarding, and potential changes to laws governing ownership of genetic material, which could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage others from supporting, developing or commercializing our products, processes and technologies;\n\u2022\npublic attitudes and ethical concerns surrounding production of feedstocks on land which could be used to grow food, which could influence public acceptance of our technologies, products and processes;\n\u2022\ngovernmental reaction to negative publicity concerning genetically engineered organisms, which could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and derivative products; and\n\u2022\ngovernmental reaction to negative publicity concerning feedstocks produced on land which could be used to grow food, which could result in greater government regulation of feedstock sources.\nAny of the risks discussed below could result in increased expenses, delays or other impediments to our programs or the public acceptance and commercialization of products and processes dependent on our technologies or inventions. In addition, the subjects of genetically engineered organisms and food versus fuel have received negative publicity, which has aroused public debate. This adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically engineered products or feedstocks grown on land suitable for food production.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur inability to adequately protect, or any loss of our intellectual property rights, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend, in part, upon our ability to maintain patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our products from competition. We rely principally on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and physical security measures to establish and protect the intellectual property rights relevant to our business. We own or have rights in issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our technologies, including the microorganism (biocatalyst) we use in our fermentation processes, methods of producing our products, and the use of our products in specific applications. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, collaboration partners and scientific and other business advisers. These measures, which seek to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation or other violation, may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or processes in a timely fashion, or at all, or abandon applications when we determine that a product or method is no longer of interest;\n\u2022\nwe cannot predict which of our pending patent applications, if any, will result in issued patents for various reasons, including the existence of prior art that we had not been aware of, conflicting patents by others, or defects in our applications;\n\u2022\nwe do not know whether the examination of any of our patent applications by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or any similar foreign patent offices will require us to narrow or even cancel any of the claims in our pending patent applications, or to abandon a patent application altogether;\n\u2022\neven if our patents are granted, they may be challenged by third parties through reexamination or interference proceedings in the U.S., or opposition or cancellation proceedings in Europe, or via similar proceedings in other jurisdictions, which could result in the cancellation of certain of our patent claims or the loss of the challenged patent entirely;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to protect some of our technologies, and even if we receive patent or similar protection, the scope of our intellectual property rights may offer insufficient protection against lawful competition or unauthorized use;\n\u2022\nour products and processes may rely on the technology of others and, therefore, may require us to obtain intellectual property licenses, if available, from third parties in order for us to manufacture or commercialize our products or practice our processes;\n\u2022\nthe patents we have been granted or may be granted may not include claims covering our products and processes, may lapse or expire, be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or be deemed unenforceable, or we may abandon them;\n\u2022\nour confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement prohibitive;\n\u2022\nwe may not be aware of infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, or we may elect not to seek to prevent them;\n\u2022\nour efforts to safeguard our trade secrets may be insufficient to prohibit the disclosure of our confidential information;\n\u2022\neven if we enforce our rights aggressively, injunctions, fines and other penalties may be insufficient to deter violations of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nif we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid, anti-competitive, otherwise unenforceable, or are already licensed to the party against whom we are asserting the claim; and\n\u2022\nother persons may independently develop proprietary technology, information and processes that are functionally equivalent or superior to our proprietary intellectual property and processes but do not infringe or conflict with our patented or unpatented proprietary rights, or may use their own proprietary intellectual property rights to block us from taking full advantage of the market.\nOur patent rights may not protect us against competition.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to obtain patent protection in the United States and in other countries for patent applications that we own or in-license from others that cover certain technologies used in, or relating to, our products and processes. Interpreting the scope and validity of patents and success in prosecuting patent applications involves complex legal and factual questions, and the issuance, scope, validity, and enforceability of a patent cannot be predicted with any certainty. Patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, third parties could practice our inventions in secret and/or in territories where we do not have patent protection. Such third parties may then try to sell or import resulting products in and into the United States or other territories. We may be unable to prove that such products were made using our inventions or infringed our intellectual property rights. Additional uncertainty may result from recent changes in the U.S. patent laws under the America Invents Act, which was signed into law on September 16, 2011 and from legal precedent handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court and the courts of other countries, as they determine legal issues relating to the scope, validity and construction of patent claims. Because patent applications in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing, if at all, and because the publication of discoveries in the scientific literature often lags behind the actual discoveries, there is additional uncertainty as to the priority dates of our inventions compared to inventions by others, and uncertainty as to the patentability of the claims in our pending patent applications and the validity and enforceability of claims in our issued patents. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that any of our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications will result in issued patents, or if issued, the validity and/or enforceability of the issued patents. Also, we cannot guarantee that a competing patent application will not be granted with claims that cover our proposed organism or processes, or that our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications or patents will not be subject to an interference proceeding with a competing patent or patent application.\nMoreover, we cannot be sure that any of our or our licensors\u2019 patent rights will be broad enough in scope to provide commercial advantage and prevent circumvention. Furthermore, patents are enforceable only for a limited term, and some of the U.S. patents that we have in-licensed exclusively relating to our biocatalyst will start to expire in 2015.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, or lawsuits asserted by a third party, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nThe success of our business is highly dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and/or technology. Policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable, as is enforcing these rights against unauthorized use by others. Identifying unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult because we may be unable to monitor the processes and/or materials being employed by other parties. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a patent of ours or our licensors may be found invalid, unenforceable, anti-competitive or not infringed. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nThird parties may challenge our or our licensors\u2019 patents via reexamination proceedings or inter partes review in the United States, opposition or cancellation proceedings in Europe, or similar proceedings in other jurisdictions. The outcome of these proceedings can be unpredictable and may result in the claims being substantially narrowed or cancelled altogether. As a result of changes in U.S. patent law under the America Invents Act, any U.S. patent that we or our licensors obtain having an effective filing\ndate on or after March 16, 2013 could be challenged by a third party using the new post-grant review process, which could result in the claims of the challenged patents being narrowed or even cancelled. Furthermore, in the United States, patents with an effective filing date prior to March 16, 2013 are awarded to the first person to make an invention rather than to the first person to file a patent application, and therefore such patents could be subject to an interference proceeding conducted by the USPTO to determine which party was the first to create an invention. As result, interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. As a result, our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may take several years to resolve, result in substantial costs, and distract our management and other employees, and otherwise interfere with the running of our business. We may be unable to prevent, alone or with our licensors, infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. Furthermore, because of the amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively affect our rights, competitive position and business.\nWe may in the future decide to build, or partner with others in building manufacturing facilities using our technologies in countries other than the United States and Canada. We may not have sufficient patent or other intellectual property rights in those countries to prevent a competitor from using our or competing technologies. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal, state and provincial laws in the United States and Canada. Many companies have encountered problems in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us or our licensors to prevent or stop any infringement of our or our licensors\u2019 patents or misappropriation of the subject matter of our other proprietary or intellectual property rights. Proceedings to enforce our and our licensors\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or in-license.\nWe may be unable to operate our business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject us to costly litigation or prevent us from offering certain products which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we are currently unaware of any claims or threatened claims, our ability to manufacture and commercialize our proposed technologies, processes and products depends upon our and our licensors\u2019 ability to develop, manufacture, market, license and/or sell such technologies, processes and products without violating the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in fields that relate to our proposed technologies, processes and products and our underlying methodologies and discoveries. In addition, many companies actively police and enforce their intellectual property rights, including their patent rights, to gain a competitive advantage. Third parties may allege that our existing or proposed technologies, processes and products or our methods infringe their intellectual property rights. It is possible that the number and frequency of law suits alleging infringement of intellectual property rights may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a greater risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. We cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. If the making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing of our proposed products or practice of our proprietary technologies or processes are found to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we could be prohibited from manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology, process or product unless we obtain a license under the applicable third party patent and pay royalties or are able to design around such patent.\nWe may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may be unable to redesign our products, biocatalysts or processes to avoid infringement. Even if we are able to redesign our products, biocatalysts or processes to avoid an infringement claim, our efforts to design around the patent could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may lead to an inferior or more costly product and/or process. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even one without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management and employees, and generally interfere with our business. Furthermore, if any such claim is successful, a court could order us to pay substantial damages, including compensatory damages for any infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently prohibit us, our licensees and our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing one or more of our products or practicing our proprietary technologies or processes, or could enter\nan order requiring us to undertake certain remedial activities. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely in part on trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and security procedures, which can be difficult to protect and enforce, and which may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information; our failure to obtain or maintain such protections could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely in part on trade secret laws and contractual agreements to protect some of our confidential and proprietary information, technology and processes, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We have taken various measures to protect our trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, including requiring new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting engagement with us. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain and protect and our security procedures may be insufficient to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets. In addition, discussions with our business partners, including our licensors, may require us to share confidential and proprietary information with them and other third parties. Our business partners\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other business advisers may unintentionally or willfully breach their confidentiality and/or non-use obligations, including by disclosing our confidential or proprietary information to our competitors. Such agreements may be deemed unenforceable, fail to provide adequate remedies, or become subject to disputes that may not be resolved in our favor. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, foreign courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. Furthermore, trade secret laws do not prevent our competitors from independently developing equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how that could be used to compete with us and our products.\nWe may lose our competitive advantage if our competitors develop similar, analogous or alternative organisms that produce bio-succinic acid or other competing chemical products.\nWe currently use proprietary microorganisms (biocatalysts) in our production of bio-succinic acid and other cellular metabolites such as C6 compounds. If our organisms are stolen, or misappropriated, they could be used by third parties for their own commercial gain, even though they may be in breach of our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may use similar or analogous organisms in jurisdictions where we or our licensors do not have patent protection. Third parties may also independently develop similar, analogous or alternative organisms that can also produce bio-succinic acid or other metabolites without infringing our intellectual property rights. If any of these were to occur, it could be difficult for us to discover, challenge or prevent the third party from using their organisms and competing with us in the production of bio-succinic acid or other metabolites.\nOur rights to key intellectual property are in-licensed from third parties, and the limitation or termination of these and related agreements would be highly detrimental to us and our business.\nWe are a party to certain license agreements that provide us with the right to practice key technology used in our business. For example, we have entered into license agreements with UT-Battelle, LLC, or UT-Batelle, and UChicago Argonne, LLC, or UChicago Argonne, for the E. coli bacterium to produce bio-succinic acid, Cargill for our yeast that is being developed to produce bio-succinic acid, DuPont for catalysts and methods for converting our bio-succinic acid into bio-based 1,4 BDO, and Celexion for a procedure to make C6 compounds, such as adipic acid. All of these license agreements impose various obligations on us, including royalty payments and, in certain instances, milestone payments. If we fail to comply with these or other obligations, certain agreements provide that the licensors may have the right to terminate the license or convert the exclusive license to a nonexclusive license, in which case our competitors may gain access to these important licensed technologies, and we may be unable to develop or market products, technologies or processes covered by the licensed intellectual property. Often our licensors have the right to control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of the licensed intellectual property and, if a third party infringes any of the licensed intellectual property, some of our licensors may control the resulting a legal or other proceeding against that third party to stop or prevent such infringement. As a result, our licensors may take actions or make decisions relating to these matters that could harm our business or impact our rights.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock or warrants in the public market the trading price of our common stock or warrants could decline significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future public sales of these securities or the availability of these securities for sale will have on the market price of our securities. Holders of 8,488,213 shares of our common stock, including the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants in existence prior to our initial public offering, have the right to require us to register these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to a shareholders\u2019 agreement. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock or warrants in the public market, or if the public\nperceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future. As a result of these fluctuations, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts covering the company or of investors, which could cause the market price of our securities to decline. Future quarterly fluctuations, many of which are beyond our control, may result from a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost associated with the completion of our planned manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of expenses for product development and sales, general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\ndelays or greater than anticipated expenses associated with the scale-up and the commercialization of chemicals produced using our processes;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully enter into or maintain partnering arrangements, and the terms of those relationships;\n\u2022\ncommercial success with our existing product and success in identifying and sourcing new product opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe development of new competitive technologies or products by others and competitive pricing pressures\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the prices or availability of the feedstocks required to produce chemicals using our processes or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our products, including any seasonal variations in demand;\n\u2022\nchanges in product development costs due to the achievement of certain milestones under third-party development agreements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amount that we invest to develop, acquire or license new technologies and processes;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions, including disruptions in the production process at any facility where chemicals produced using our processes are manufactured as well as a result of changes in the technologies we employ, including our transition from our E. coli bacterium to our yeast;\n\u2022\ndepartures of executives or other key management employees;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental, accounting and tax rules and regulations, environmental, health and safety requirements, and other rules and regulations.\nBased on the above factors and other uncertainties, we believe our future operating results will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. As a result, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful nor do they indicate what our future performance will be.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company and could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated by-laws; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote, and not less than 75% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, is generally necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions that are contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our amended and restated by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our board of directors has not approved. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them.\nAs a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our securities if the price of our common stock increases.\nWe will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (and cease to take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d), we incurred and will incur significant legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we did not face as a private company. As a public company, we are subject to rules and regulations that regulate corporate governance practices of public companies, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and rules promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. The compliance with these public company requirements increased and will increase our costs and make some activities more time consuming and may result in a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities. For example, we created new board committees, adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, and devoted significant management resources to our Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements. A number of those requirements will require us to carry out activities we have not performed previously. Furthermore, if we are unable to build our internal controls and accounting capabilities or subsequently identify any issues in complying with those requirements (for example, if we or our registered public accounting firm identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect us, our reputation or investor perceptions of us. We expect that the additional reporting and other obligations imposed on us by these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of our related legal, accounting and administrative activities significantly. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and have elected to take advantage of reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and delaying the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until they are applicable to private companies. As a result of our election to use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive as a result of our choice to\nrely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after our initial public offering, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nIf we fail to augment and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. In that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our securities.\nOur management is required to deliver a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, Section 404 may require our auditors to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in conjunction with their opinion on our audited financial statements beginning with the second annual report that we will be required to file with SEC. However, we have elected to take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d under the JOBS Act and therefore we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until after the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, which may be up to five years from our initial public offering.\nThe process of designing and implementing effective internal controls and procedures, and expanding our internal accounting capabilities, is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to establish and maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We cannot be certain at this time whether we will be able to successfully complete the implementation of controls and procedures or the certification and attestation requirements of Section 404. In the future we may have significant deficiencies, which could cause us to fail to meet the periodic reporting obligations that we will be subject to under Section 404 or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. If we identify and report a material weakness or any additional significant deficiencies, it could adversely affect our stock price.\nIf securities or industry research analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our securities and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities relies in part on the research and reports that securities and industry research analysts publish about us, our industry and our business. Securities and industry research analysts do not currently provide research coverage of us, and we cannot assure you that any research analysts, including those in the United States and Europe, will provide research coverage on us or our securities. We do not have any control over these analysts. The market price of our securities and trading volumes could decline if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrade our securities, issue unfavorable commentary about us, our industry or our business, cease to cover our company or fail to regularly publish reports about us, our industry or our business.\nThe warrants sold as part of our initial public offering may not have any value, and the holders of those warrants will have no rights as common stockholders until such holders exercise their warrants and acquire our common stock.\nThe warrants sold as part of our initial public offering will expire at 5:30 p.m. on May 9, 2017 unless we in our sole discretion extend the expiration date. In the event our common stock price does not exceed the exercise price of the warrants during the period when the warrants are exercisable, the warrants may not have any value. Until holders of warrants acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants, holders of warrants will have no rights with respect to the shares of our common stock underlying such warrants. Upon exercise of the warrants, the holders thereof will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\nWe have listed our common stock on the Professional Segment of NYSE Euronext in Paris under the symbol \u201cBIOA,\u201d and therefore, the risks relating to our common stock, as set out above, apply in similar respects to investors trading our common stock on NYSE Euronext Paris. In addition, investors trading our common stock on NYSE Euronext Paris should consider the following additional risks relating specifically to the admission to listing and trading of our common stock on NYSE Euronext Paris.\nThe dual listing of our common stock on NYSE and NYSE Euronext Paris may adversely affect the liquidity and trading prices for our common stock on one or both of the exchanges as a result of circumstances that may be outside of our control.\nAlthough we believe the dual listing of our common stock is beneficial for the liquidity of our common stock as it should permit a broader base of investors to purchase shares of our common stock in secondary trading, it may also adversely affect liquidity and trading prices for our common stock on one or both of the exchanges as a result of circumstances that may be outside of our control. For example, transfers by investors of our shares from trading on one exchange to the other could result in increases or decreases in liquidity and/or trading prices on either or both of the exchanges. In addition, investors could seek to sell or buy our common stock to take advantage of any price differences between the two markets through a practice referred to as arbitrage. Any arbitrage activity could create unexpected volatility in both our common stock prices on both exchange and the volumes of shares of our common stock available for trading on either exchange.\nOur common stock is dual listed and trades in U.S. dollars on NYSE and in Euros on NYSE Euronext Paris, and the trading price of our common stock on NYSE Euronext Paris and the value of dividends, if any, paid on our common stock to investors who hold our common stock on NYSE Euronext Paris and elect to receive dividends in Euros may be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate for converting U.S. dollars into Euros.\nOur common stock trades in U.S. dollars on NYSE and in Euros on NYSE Euronext Paris. Fluctuations in the exchange rate for converting U.S. dollars into Euros may affect the value of our common stock. Specifically, as the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro declines, each of the following values will also decline (and vice versa):\n\u2022\nthe Euro equivalent of the U.S. dollar trading price of our common stock on NYSE, which may consequently cause the trading price of our common stock on NYSE Euronext Paris to also decline; and\n\u2022\nthe Euro equivalent of cash dividends paid in U.S. dollars on our common stock if investors holding our common stock on NYSE Euronext Paris request dividends to be paid in Euros.", "PERMNO": 13977, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "BIOAQ"}
