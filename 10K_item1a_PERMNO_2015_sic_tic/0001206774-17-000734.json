RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights specific risks that could affect the Company\u2019s business. Although this section attempts to highlight key factors, please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and Cass cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect the Company\u2019s financial performance. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this report, the identified risks that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following:\nGeneral political, economic or industry conditions may be less favorable than expected.\nLocal, domestic, and international economic, political and industry-specific conditions and governmental monetary and fiscal policies affect the industries in which the Company competes, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, tight money supply, real estate values, international conflicts and other factors outside of Cass\u2019 control may adversely affect the Company. Economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans, which could have a material adverse impact on Cass\u2019 earnings.\nUnfavorable developments concerning customer credit quality could affect Cass\u2019 financial results.\nAlthough the Company regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Under such circumstances, the Company could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses, delinquencies, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses.\nThe Company has lending concentrations, including, but not limited to, churches and church-related entities located in selected cities and privately-held businesses located in or near St. Louis, Missouri, that could suffer a significant decline which could adversely affect the Company.\nCass\u2019 customer base consists, in part, of lending concentrations in several segments and geographical areas. If any of these segments or areas is significantly affected by weak economic conditions, the Company could experience increased credit losses, and its business could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in interest rates could affect Cass\u2019 net interest income and balance sheet.\nThe operations of financial institutions such as the Company are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions, the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions\u2019 net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates affect Cass\u2019 financial statements, as they do for all financial institutions. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d a continuation of the current low level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income.\nOperational difficulties or cyber-security problems could damage Cass\u2019 reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company depends on the reliable operation of its computer operations and network connections from its clients to its systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems would cause Cass to be unable to process transactions for its clients, resulting in decreased revenues. Additionally, any failure, interruption, breach in security or loss of data, whatever the cause, could reduce client satisfaction with the Company\u2019s products and services and harm Cass\u2019 financial results. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further, to access the Company\u2019s products and services, Cass\u2019 customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond the Company\u2019s security control systems. The Company\u2019s technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at Cass. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. A material security problem affecting Cass could damage its reputation, deter prospects from purchasing its products and services, deter customers from using its products and services or result in liability to Cass.\nAlthough the Company makes significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of Cass\u2019 information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that Cass\u2019 security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible to entirely mitigate this risk. While specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage is maintained, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under Cass\u2019 cyber insurance coverage. A security breach or other significant disruption of Cass\u2019 information systems or those related to customers, merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could 1) disrupt the proper functioning of Cass\u2019 networks and systems and therefore operations and/or those of certain customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of the Company or its customers; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose Cass to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm Cass\u2019 reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with the Company. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Cass\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCass must respond to rapid technological changes and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, the Company\u2019s existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if Cass fails to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt its products and services to emerging industry standards, Cass may lose current and future customers. Finally, Cass\u2019 ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The payment processing and financial services industries are changing rapidly and in order to remain competitive, Cass must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of its products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than the Company anticipates.\nOperations of the Company\u2019s customer base are impacted by macro-economic factors such as a strong dollar and/or volatility in commodity prices. A reduction in its customers\u2019 operations could have a material adverse effect on Cass\u2019 results of operations.\nThe recent decline in the cost of oil worldwide has had a negative effect on both the number of freight transactions processed and the dollar amount of invoices processed. For example, lower oil prices have caused a significant drop in drilling supplies being transported to fracking operations by domestic railroads and trucks, as U.S. oil prices are no longer as competitive with the prices of imported oil. Lower oil prices have also resulted in lower gas and fuel prices, negatively affecting the dollar amounts of the invoices that Cass processes for its freight and shipping customers. A further decline in oil prices would continue to have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and could significantly impact its results of operations.\nMethods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective.\nInstruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, interest rate, market and liquidity, operational, regulatory/compliance, business risks and enterprise-wide risks could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.\nCustomer borrowing, repayment, investment, deposit, and payable processing practices may be different than anticipated.\nThe Company uses a variety of financial tools, models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as part of its strategic and financial planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political and industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Cass\u2019 control could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment, deposit, and payable processing practices. Such a change in these practices could adversely affect Cass\u2019 ability to anticipate business needs, including cash flow and its impact on liquidity, and to meet regulatory requirements.\nCass\u2019 stock price can become volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can fluctuate based on factors that can include actual or anticipated variations in Cass\u2019 quarterly results; new technology or services by competitors; unanticipated losses or gains due to unexpected events, including losses or gains on securities held for investment purposes; significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or its competitors; changes in accounting policies or practices; failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; or changes in government regulations.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, governmental intervention, interest rate changes, credit loss trends, low trading volume or currency fluctuations also could cause Cass\u2019 stock price to decrease regardless of the Company\u2019s operating results.\nCompetitive product and pricing pressure within Cass\u2019 markets may change.\nThe Company operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other vendors and financial institutions in each market in which it operates. The Company competes with large payment processors and national and regional financial institutions and also smaller auditing companies and banks in terms of products and pricing. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets, business could decline.\nManagement\u2019s ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.\nThe industries in which the Company operates are very competitive. The Company not only competes for business opportunities with new customers, but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. The Company continues to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers.\nThe introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies, including, but not limited to, the expansion of payment and processing activities to new markets, the expansion of products and services to existing markets and opening of new bank branches, may be less successful or may be different than anticipated. Such a result could adversely affect Cass\u2019 business.\nThe Company makes certain projections as a basis for developing plans and strategies for its payment processing and banking products. If the Company does not accurately determine demand for its products and services, it could result in the Company incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in an adverse effect on its earnings.\nManagement\u2019s ability to retain key officers and employees may change.\nCass\u2019 future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of Cass\u2019 executive officers and key personnel. Cass\u2019 future operating results also depend in significant part upon Cass\u2019 ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales, and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the Company cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for the Company to hire personnel over time. Cass\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by Cass\u2019 inability to attract and retain skilled employees.\nRecent legislative and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is significantly changing the current bank regulatory structure and affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.\nThe Company and the Bank are supervised and regulated primarily by the FRB. In addition, the Company is subject to consolidated capital requirements, made more strict by the recent adoptions and implementation of the Basel III Capital Rules, and must serve as a source of strength to the Bank. It is possible such requirements may limit our capacity to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a specific level. The Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance premiums increased substantially beginning in 2009, and the Bank expects to pay high premiums in the future. Economic conditions during the recent recession increased bank failures and decreased the DIF. The FDIC may increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to keep the DIF at the statutory target level. Any increase in our FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s profits and financial condition.\nThe scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions will be determined over time as regulations are issued and become effective. As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act at this time, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit the ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations. However, it is expected that at a minimum, any new regulations issued will increase operating and compliance costs.\nNew capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the final Basel III Capital Rules that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel III Capital Rules will apply to banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. As discussed in Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation,\u201d the Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period that generally extends through January 1, 2019. The final rules increase capital requirements and generally include two new capital measurements that will affect the Company-a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. Common equity Tier 1 capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as the Company) to continue to include trust preferred securities and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not common equity Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2, as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock.\nThe final rules adjust all three categories of capital by requiring new deductions from and adjustments to capital that will result in more stringent capital requirements. Beginning January 1, 2015, the minimum capital requirements are (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4%. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer is being phased in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increase the risk weights for certain assets, meaning that the Company will have to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements now must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the previous 100%. There are also new risk weights for unsettled transactions and derivatives. There will also be a requirement to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable (currently, there are no capital requirements for these off-balance sheet assets). All changes to the risk weights took effect in 2015. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit the ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back shares.\nCass is subject to extensive regulatory oversight.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that is designed primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors, and not to the benefit of the shareholders. As a result, the Company is limited in the manner in which it conducts business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Failure to comply with these and other regulatory requirements can lead to, among other remedies, administrative enforcement actions and other legal proceedings, including the imposition of civil money penalties.\nChanges in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on Cass\u2019 operations.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Missouri Division of Finance, the FDIC, the FRB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which the Company may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on Cass\u2019 operations, investigations and limitations related to Cass\u2019 securities, the classification of Cass\u2019 assets and determination of the level of Cass\u2019 allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on Cass\u2019 operations.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving the Company and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect Cass or the financial services industry in general.\nThe Company is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of Cass\u2019 efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on Cass\u2019 financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by Cass\u2019 regulators that could materially adversely affect Cass\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. Please refer to Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are the basis of how Cass reports its financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. In addition, changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or other authoritative bodies, could materially impact Cass\u2019 financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Cass records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure that they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report Cass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in the Company reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCass has identified three accounting policies as being \u201ccritical\u201d to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. More information on Cass\u2019 critical accounting policies is contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nFrom time to time, the regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), and other authoritative bodies change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how management records and reports the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCass is subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities, which, if not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, Cass and its affiliates are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments it has made and the businesses in which it is engaged. Recently, federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, they could have an adverse effect on Cass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nThere could be terrorist activities or other hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Company.\nThe terrorist attacks in September 2001 in the United States and ensuing events, as well as the resulting decline in consumer confidence, had a material adverse effect on the economy. Any similar future events may disrupt Cass\u2019 operations or those of its customers. In addition, these events had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm Cass\u2019 operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm Cass\u2019 stock price and may limit the capital resources available to its customers and the Company. This could have a significant impact on Cass\u2019 operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of Cass\u2019 common stock.\nThere could be natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires and floods, which may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Company.\nThe Company has significant operations and customer base in Missouri, California, Ohio, Massachusetts, South Carolina, Kansas, Florida, Colorado and other regions where natural disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires and floods. These types of natural disasters at times have disrupted the local economy, Cass\u2019 business and customers and have posed physical risks to Cass\u2019 property. A significant natural disaster could materially affect Cass\u2019 operating results.", "PERMNO": 83738, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "CASS"}
