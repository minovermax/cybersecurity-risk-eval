{"cik": "351569", "company": "Ameris Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Common Stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect Ameris are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. This Annual Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Common Stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND INDUSTRY\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can adversely affect our industry and business.\nOur financial performance generally, and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay the principal of outstanding loans and the value of the collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions could lead to credit quality concerns related to repayment ability and collateral protection, as well as reduced demand for the products and services we offer. In recent years there has been gradual improvement in the U.S. economy as evidenced by a rebound in the housing market, lower unemployment, increased consumer demand and higher equities markets. However, economic growth and business spending appear to be slowing, financial market volatility has increased and opinions vary on whether the U.S. economy can continue to keep growing after more than a decade of growth and recovery following the Great Recession. Uncertainties also have arisen as a result of increased tariffs and other changes to U.S. trade policies and reactions to such changes by China and other U.S. trading partners, as well as impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, China. In addition, economic growth in international markets also appears to be slowing, particularly in China and Europe, which also may impact the economy and financial markets in the United States. While we have no banking operations in Europe, the impact of Great Britain\u2019s exit from the Europe Union on British and European businesses, financial markets and related businesses in the United States could also adversely affect financial markets generally. Our business also could be adversely affected directly by the default of another institution or if the financial services industry experiences significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems.\nFactors related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, changes in tariffs and trade policies, international conflicts, real estate values, energy prices, state and local municipal budget deficits, consumer confidence level, government spending and any government shutdowns, the U.S. national debt, natural disasters, geopolitical events, public health crises (such as the recent coronavirus outbreak) and other factors outside of our control also may assert economic pressures on consumers and businesses and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may face the following risks, among others, in connection with these events:\n\u2022Unfavorable market conditions triggered by any of these events (such as, for example, the recent coronavirus outbreak) can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan losses, adverse asset values and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio.\n\u2022Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement resulting from any of these events (including, but not limited to, the recent coronavirus outbreak) may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans or our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including qualitative factors that pertain to economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process.\n\u2022The value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected by increasing interest rates and defaults by debtors.\n\u2022To the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nA trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers\u2019 products and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are highly correlated to market interest rates.\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature, and as a result, we are subject to significant risks tied to changes in interest rates. Our ability to operate profitably is largely dependent upon net interest income. In 2019, net interest income made up 71.8% of our revenue. Unexpected movement in interest rates, that may or may not change the slope of the current yield curve, could cause our net interest margins to decrease, subsequently decreasing net interest income. In addition, such changes could materially adversely affect the valuation of our assets and liabilities.\nAt present our one-year interest rate sensitivity position is mildly asset sensitive, such that a gradual increase in interest rates during the next twelve months should have a slightly positive impact on net interest income during that period. However, as with most financial institutions, our results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage this risk. The difference between interest rates charged on interest-earning assets and interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities may be affected by changes in market interest rates, changes in relationships between interest rate indices, and changes in the relationships between long-term and short-term market interest rates. In addition, the mix of assets and liabilities could change as varying levels of market interest rates might present our customer base with more attractive options.\nCertain changes in interest rates, inflation, deflation or the financial markets could affect demand for our products and our ability to deliver products efficiently.\nLoan originations, and potentially loan revenues, could be materially adversely impacted by sharply rising interest rates. Conversely, sharply falling rates could increase prepayments within our securities portfolio lowering interest earnings from those investments. An unanticipated increase in inflation could cause our operating costs related to salaries and benefits, technology and supplies to increase at a faster pace than revenues.\nThe fair market value of our securities portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nOur concentration of real estate loans subjects the Company to risks that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe majority of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As the economy deteriorated and depressed real estate values in recent years, the collateral value of the portfolio and the revenue stream from those loans came under stress and required additional provision to the allowance for loan losses. Our ability to dispose of foreclosed real estate and resolve credit quality issues is dependent on real estate activity and real estate prices, both of which have been unpredictable for several years.\nGreater loan losses than expected may materially adversely affect our earnings.\nWe, as lenders, are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in\nthe business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio will relate principally to the creditworthiness of business entities and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans. Our credit risk with respect to our commercial loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses within our local markets. Our credit risk with respect to our consumer loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors. We believe that our current allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, if our assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. We may have to increase our allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators, to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions, or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions.\nOur business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a geographically concentrated part of the United States.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our banking offices are primarily concentrated in select markets in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and South Carolina. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022an increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022an increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022a decrease in the demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022a decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nWe face additional risks due to our increased mortgage banking activities that could negatively impact net income and profitability.\nWe sell the majority of the mortgage loans that we originate. The sale of these loans generates noninterest income and can be a source of liquidity for the Bank. Disruption in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans as well as declines in real estate values could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022our inability to sell mortgage loans on the secondary market, which could negatively impact our liquidity position;\n\u2022declines in real estate values could decrease the potential of mortgage originations, which could negatively impact our earnings;\n\u2022if it is determined that loans were made in breach of our representations and warranties to the secondary market, we could incur losses associated with the loans;\n\u2022increased compliance requirements could result in higher compliance costs, higher foreclosure proceedings or lower loan origination volume, all which could negatively impact future earnings; and\n\u2022a rise in interest rates could cause a decline in mortgage originations, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nLegislation and regulatory proposals enacted in response to market and economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. We are subject to examinations, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors, not shareholders. The burden imposed by federal and state regulations puts banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies and leasing companies. Changes in the laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry and our compliance with them may increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for others. Federal economic and monetary policies may also affect our ability to attract deposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nOur growth and financial performance may be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully execute our growth plans.\nEconomic conditions and other factors, such as our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion, our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, our ability to fund earning asset growth at a reasonable and profitable level, sufficient capital to support our growth initiatives, competitive factors and banking laws, will impact our success.\nWe may seek to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions. We cannot predict with certainty the number, size or timing of acquisitions, or whether any such acquisitions will occur at all. Our acquisition efforts have traditionally focused on targeted banking entities in markets in which we currently operate and markets in which we believe we can compete effectively. However, as consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. We may compete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay. We also may need additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or, if available, it may not be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to sell on terms acceptable to us, or we are otherwise unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing necessary for us to continue making acquisitions, we would be required to find other methods to grow our business and we may not grow at the same rate we have in the past, or at all.\nGenerally, we must receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a bank or bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on the competition, financial condition and future prospects. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including both institutions' CRA performance history) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We may also be required to sell banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefits of any acquisition.\nIn the past, we have utilized de novo branching in new and existing markets as a way to supplement our growth. De novo branching and any acquisition carry with it numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022significant costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank;\n\u2022the inability to secure the services of qualified senior management;\n\u2022the local market may not accept the services of a new bank owned and managed by a bank holding company headquartered outside of the market area of the new bank;\n\u2022economic downturns in the new market;\n\u2022the inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost; and\n\u2022the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nWe have experienced to some extent many of these risks with our de novo branching to date.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank for most of our revenue.\nAmeris is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Common Stock and interest and principal on the Company\u2019s debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. Also, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Common Stock and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Consequently, cash-based activities, including further investments in the Bank or in support of the Bank, could require borrowings or additional issuances of common or preferred stock.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nWe are subject to the regulations of the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the GDBF, the CFPB and other governmental agencies and regulatory bodies. New regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. We are subject to various federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact our business plans, including our ability to branch, offer certain products or execute existing or planned business strategies.\nWe are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could materially adversely affect the reported financial statements or our results of operations and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and we cannot be assured that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us.\nA new accounting standard will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current generally accepted accounting principles, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new CECL accounting standard will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently finalizing our evaluation of the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to equity and the allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We currently estimate our allowance for loan losses will increase to a range of $85 million to $120 million, and we expect to recognize a liability for unfunded commitments between $10 million and $20 million. However, the final impact of our transition to the CECL model may differ from these estimates.\nOur total consolidated assets increased to over $10 billion as of June 30, 2018, which will subject us to additional regulations and oversight that were not previously applicable to us and that will impact our revenues and/or expenses.\nUpon completion of the acquisition of Hamilton in June 2018, the Company and the Bank exceeded $10 billion in total consolidated assets. As a result, certain additional requirements now apply to the Company or the Bank, including the following: (i) the examination and enforcement authority of the CFPB with respect to consumer and small business products and services; (ii) deposit insurance premium assessments based on an FDIC scorecard based on, among other things, the Bank\u2019s CAMELS rating and results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress testing; and (iii) a cap on interchange transaction fees for debit cards, as required by Federal Reserve regulations, which will significantly reduce our interchange revenue.\nIt is difficult to predict the overall compliance cost of these provisions. However, compliance with these provisions will likely require additional staffing, engagement of external consultants and other operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on the future financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nWe are subject to industry competition which may have an impact upon our success.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive financial services environment. Certain competitors are larger and may have more resources than we do. We face competition in our regional market areas from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, internet banks, mortgage companies,\nfinance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us or our bank subsidiary and may have greater flexibility in competing for business.\nAnother competitive factor is that the financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology competitively to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in our operations.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nThe results of our operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of uncertain conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, we cannot predict with certainty possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or our business and earnings.\nWe may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital.\nOur Common Stock is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). If the liquidity of the Nasdaq market should fail to operate at a time when we may seek to raise equity capital, or if conditions in the capital markets are adverse, we may be constrained in raising capital. Downgrades in the opinions of the analysts that follow our Company may cause our stock price to fall and significantly limit our ability to access the markets for additional capital. Should these risks materialize, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisition may be limited.\nWe may invest or spend the proceeds in stock offerings in ways with which you may not agree and in ways that may not earn a profit.\nWe may choose to use the proceeds of future stock offerings for general corporate purposes, including for possible acquisition opportunities that may become available. It is not known whether suitable acquisition opportunities may become available or whether we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions. We may use the proceeds of an offering only to focus on sustaining our organic, or internal, growth or for other purposes. In addition, we may use all or a portion of the proceeds of an offering to support our capital. You may not agree with the ways we decide to use the proceeds of any stock offerings, and our use of the proceeds may not yield any profits.\nThe transition away from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) will affect our adjustable rate loan and other agreements and may have an impact on our business operations.\nIn 2014, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d), was convened by the Federal Reserve to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. In June 2017, the ARRC announced the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began to publish SOFR rates on a daily basis. In 2019, the ARRC finalized draft language for adjustable rate debt product contracts to provide for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR rates. The language is voluntary and would apply only to new contracts. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has said that in early 2020 it will begin to publish SOFR \u201cterm rates\u201d which would provide replacements for specific LIBOR term rates.\nGiven LIBOR\u2019s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including Ameris and the Bank. Our commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade and hold various products that are indexed to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, Ameris had approximately $2.81 billion of loans and derivatives with a notional value of $57.8 million, indexed to LIBOR. In addition, we had approximately $309.5 million of debt securities outstanding that are indexed to LIBOR (either currently or in the future) as of December 31, 2019. We had $109.9 million of investment securities indexed to LIBOR as of December 31, 2019. Our financial instruments and products that are indexed to LIBOR are significant, and if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks.\nWe face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nOur ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while we expand. Similar to other large corporations, in our case, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or persons outside of our Company and exposure to external events. We are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new customers depends in part on the functionality of our technology systems. Additionally, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.\nWe continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third party providers of such platforms into our existing businesses.\nCyberattacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. We also have arrangements in place with other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs, our facilities and systems, and those of third-party service providers, are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us continue to increase in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers continue to engage in attacks against financial institutions. These attacks include denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customer facing services and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Accordingly, we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with our own and third-party systems, processes and data, including credit and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks (e.g., Visa, MasterCard) and our processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. While we conduct security reviews on these third parties, we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach.\nThe access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets could result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our industry continues to experience well-publicized attacks or breaches affecting others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit and debit cards, which have caused some consumers, including our customers, to use our credit and debit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on, and potentially new regulations relating to, these methods. Further cyberattacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting us or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of\nour cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyberattacks or other breaches, our brand and reputation could be affected, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may adversely affect our ability to prepare our consolidated financial statements in a timely and accurate manner.\nAs further described in Item 9A below, management has identified a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company identified a control deficiency related to certain general ledger account reconciliations that began as of the conversion of Fidelity\u2019s core platform on November 3, 2019. While the reconciliations were completed in a timely manner, various items, which were principally related to the acquired indirect auto loan portfolio, were not researched and resolved in a timely manner. Further review and analysis indicate that clearing of the items did not have any material adverse impact to customer account balances or the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, this control deficiency creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis, and as such, management has concluded that the control deficiency represents a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement has been actively engaged during the first quarter of 2020 in developing remediation plans to address the material weakness. These plans include: (i) additional training for accounting staff performing the reconciliations; (ii) development of more detailed reconciliation procedures to allow for more timely research and resolution of items; (iii) increased personnel in the accounting department to ensure timeliness of clearing reconciling items; and (iv) the review of the system interface to the general ledger such that the number of reconciling items among impacted balance sheet accounts will be reduced.\nIf our remediation efforts are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, a material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements could occur that may continue undetected.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon customer and other external perceptions of our business practices and our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices or our financial health could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws, regulations or regulatory actions that may change or constrain the manner in which we engage with our customers and the products we offer. Adverse reputational impacts or events may also increase our litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions, but we cannot be certain that our efforts will completely mitigate these risks.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the Company can be intense and the Company may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Company\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of the Company\u2019s market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nWe engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time. These acquisitions may not produce revenue or earnings enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties.\nWhen appropriate opportunities arise, we will engage in acquisitions of other businesses. Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence or other anticipated benefits from any acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of our business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. We will likely need to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loan balances as a result of any significant acquisition, which may materially adversely impact our earnings. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected.\nDepending on the condition of any institution that we may acquire, any acquisition may, at least in the near term, materially adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated following the acquisition, may continue to have such effects.\nNatural disasters, geopolitical events, public health crises and other catastrophic events beyond our control could adversely affect us.\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, wildfires, extreme weather conditions and other acts of nature, geopolitical events such as those involving civil unrest, changes in government regimes, terrorism or military conflict, and pandemics and other public health crises, such as the recent outbreaks of novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our business operations and those of our customers, counterparties and service providers, and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property, including damage to or destruction of mortgaged properties or our own banking facilities and offices. Natural disasters, geopolitical events, public health crises and other catastrophic events, or concerns about the occurrence of any such events, could impair our borrowers\u2019 ability to service their loans, decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers, erode the value of loan collateral, including mortgaged properties, result in an increase in the amount of our non-performing loans and a higher level of non-performing assets, including real estate owned, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses, lead to other operational difficulties and impair our ability to manage our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock. We also could be adversely affected if our key personnel or a significant number of our employees were to become unavailable due to a public health crisis (such as an outbreak of a contagious disease), natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident or other reason.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our Common Stock is volatile and may decline.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other financial institutions;\n\u2022failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022actions by institutional shareholders;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments, including changes in accounting rules;\n\u2022proposed or adopted changes or developments in tax policies or rates;\n\u2022anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; or\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nA significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nSecurities issued by us, including our Common Stock, are not FDIC insured.\nSecurities issued by us, including our Common Stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC, the Deposit Insurance Fund or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s debt obligations and any shares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock that may be outstanding in the future will have priority over the Company\u2019s common stock with respect to payment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up and with respect to the payment of interest and preferred dividends.\nIn the event of any winding up and termination of the Company, our Common Stock would rank below all claims of the holders of the Company\u2019s debt and any preferred stock then outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $127.6 million and other subordinated notes payable with a carrying value of $268.2 million.\nUpon the winding up and termination of the Company, holders of our Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets until after all of our obligations to our debt holders have been satisfied and holders of our senior debt, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities have received any payments and other distributions due to them. In addition, we are required to pay interest on our senior debt, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the Company\u2019s trust preferred securities before we pay any dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe may borrow funds or issue additional debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our Common Stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our Common Stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock, common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our Common Stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate with certainty the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. In addition, the borrowing of funds or issuance of debt would increase our leverage and decrease our liquidity, and the issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.\nYou may not receive dividends on the Common Stock.\nHolders of our Common Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. In 2010, in response to anticipated increases in corporate risks, our Board suspended the payment of dividends on our Common Stock. In 2014, our Board reinstated the payment of dividends on our Common Stock; however, the payment of dividends could be suspended again at any time.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our Common Stock in the public markets, or the perception of such sales, could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public markets and the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, future issuances of equity securities, including pursuant to outstanding options, could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders and could cause the market price of our\nCommon Stock to decline. We may issue such additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital. Depending on the amount offered and the levels at which we offer the stock, issuances of common or preferred stock could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our Common Stock. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock, phantom shares, stock appreciation rights, options or warrants to purchase our Common Stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options or warrants are exercised or as shares of the restricted stock vest, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our shares of Common Stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. We cannot predict with certainty the effect that future sales of our Common Stock would have on the market price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 80498, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ABCB"}
