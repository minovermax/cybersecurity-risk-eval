RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThere are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a summary of significant factors that might cause our future results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial position, operating results, cash flows, reserves or our ability to pay our debts and other liabilities could suffer, the trading price and liquidity of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nChapter 11 Cases Risks\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the consummation of a plan of reorganization will result in the cancellation and discharge of our equity securities, including our common stock.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with restructuring matters rather than focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection and operating as debtors in possession also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success of our business. In addition, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our customers, vendors and service providers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships, renegotiate the terms of our agreements, terminate their relationships with us or require financial assurances from us, subject to the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Code.\nOther significant risks include or relate to the following:\n\u2022the effects of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and the interests of various constituents, including our shareholders;\n\u2022Bankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases, including with respect to our motions, as well as the outcome of other pending litigation;\n\u2022our ability to operate within the restrictions and the liquidity limitations of the DIP Credit Agreement and any related orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022our ability to maintain strategic control as debtors in possession during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022the length of time that we will operate with Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022increased advisory costs during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022the risks associated with restrictions on our ability to pursue some of our business strategies during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022our ability to satisfy the conditions precedent to consummation of a plan of reorganization;\n\u2022the potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022the ultimate outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022the cancellation of our existing equity securities, including our outstanding shares of common stock in the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022the potential material adverse effects of claims that may not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022uncertainties regarding the reactions of our customers, prospective customers, vendors and service providers to the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022uncertainties regarding our ability to retain and motivate key personnel; and\n\u2022uncertainties and continuing risks associated with our ability to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nFurther, under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events, to take advantage of certain opportunities or adapt to changing market or industry conditions.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we provide any assurance as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nDelays in the Chapter 11 Cases may increase the risk of us being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThere can be no assurance that a plan of reorganization will become effective in accordance with its terms on the timeline we anticipate, or at all. Prolonged Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with customers and employees, among other parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement a plan of reorganization (or any other Chapter 11 plan). If we are unable to consummate a plan of reorganization, we may be forced to liquidate.\nWe are subject to certain risks and uncertainties if our exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization is terminated.\nAt the outset of a Chapter 11 case, the Bankruptcy Code provides debtors in possession the exclusive right to file and solicit acceptance of a plan of reorganization for the first 120 days of the bankruptcy case, subject to extension at the discretion of the court. All other parties are prohibited from filing or soliciting a plan of reorganization during this period. If the Bankruptcy Court terminates that right or the exclusivity period expires, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve confirmation of a plan in order to achieve our stated goals. The possible decision of creditors and/or other third parties, whose interest may be inconsistent with our own, to file alternative plans of reorganization could further protract the Chapter 11 Cases, leading us to continue to incur significant professional fees and costs. Because of these risks and uncertainties associated with the termination or expiration of our exclusivity rights, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nTrading in our common stock during the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.\nThe RSA contemplates that our existing equity interests will be cancelled and discharged in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the holders of those equity interests will be entitled to no recovery. Accordingly, any trading in our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of our common stock.\nSince November 30, 2020, our common stock has been trading on the OTC Pink Marketplace maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol \u201cGPORQ\u201d. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange, due to factors such as a reduction in the number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the number of market makers in the securities, reduction in securities analyst and news media coverage and lower market prices than might otherwise be obtained. In addition to those factors, the market for the outstanding shares of our common stock has been adversely affected by the provisions of the RSA that contemplate that our existing equity interests will be cancelled and discharged in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the holders of those equity interests, including the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock, will be entitled to no recovery relating to those equity interests. We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on the OTC Pink Marketplace, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on that market,\nwhether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for our common stock will continue to be provided on that market in the future.\nThe RSA is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nThere are certain material conditions we must satisfy under the RSA, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the Chapter 11 Cases, which include the consummation of the financing contemplated by the Exit Credit Facilities and other transactions contemplated by a plan of reorganization. Our ability to timely complete such milestones is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.\nA plan of reorganization may not become effective.\nEven if a plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (some of which are beyond our control). There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied and, therefore, that a plan of reorganization will become effective and that the Debtors will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by a plan of reorganization. If the effective date of a plan of reorganization is delayed, the Debtors may not have sufficient cash available to operate their businesses. In that case, the Debtors may need new or additional post-petition financing, which may increase the cost of consummating a plan of reorganization. There can be no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by a plan of reorganization are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the plan of reorganization. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2020 contain disclosures that express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such assumption may not be justified. Our liquidity has been negatively impacted by the prolonged depressed price averages we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sell and our substantial indebtedness and associated debt-related expenses. As a result of these and other factors, we entered into the RSA and commenced the Chapter 11 Cases. The RSA contemplates that our equity investors, including the holders of our common stock, will lose the entire value of their investment in our business. The inclusion of disclosures that express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and have an adverse impact on our relationships with third parties with whom we do business, including our customers, subcontractors, suppliers and employees, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors will likely change significantly.\nThe composition of our Board of Directors is expected to change significantly following the Chapter 11 Cases. Any new directors may have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who currently serve on our Board of Directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of our company. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past.\nFinancial, Liquidity and Commodity Price Risks\nNatural gas, oil and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur revenues, cash flows, profitability, future rate of growth, production and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil and NGL. We incur substantial expenditures to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Low oil, natural gas and NGL prices can negatively affect the amount of cash available for capital expenditures, debt service and debt repayment and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves. In addition, periods of low natural gas, oil and NGL prices may result in ceiling test write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties.\nHistorically, the markets for natural gas, oil and NGL have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. For example, during 2019, West Texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, prices ranged from $46.31 to $66.24 per barrel and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $1.75 to $4.25 per MMBtu. During 2020, WTI prices ranged from $(36.98) to $63.27 per barrel and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $1.33 to $3.14 per MMBtu.\nWide fluctuations in natural gas, oil and NGL prices may result from factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide supplies of oil, natural gas and NGL, including U.S. inventories of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022changes in the level of consumer and industrial demand, including impacts from global or national health epidemics and concerns, such as the recent coronavirus;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the expected rates of declining current production;\n\u2022changes in the level of consumer and industrial demand;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022risks associated with operating drilling rigs;\n\u2022the effectiveness of worldwide conservation measures;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and processing facilities;\n\u2022the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others;\n\u2022U.S. exports of oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022the price and level of foreign imports;\n\u2022the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022political or economic instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022acts of terrorism; and\n\u2022domestic and global economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future natural gas, oil and NGL price movements with any certainty. Even with natural gas, oil and NGL derivatives currently in place to mitigate price risks associated with a portion of our 2021 cash flows, we have substantial exposure to natural gas prices, and to a lesser extent, oil and NGL prices, in 2022 and beyond. In addition, a prolonged extension of lower prices could reduce the quantities of reserves that we may economically produce. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed, full cost accounting rules may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nOur commodity price risk management activities may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices, may require us to provide collateral for derivative liabilities and involve risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.\nTo manage our exposure to price volatility, we enter into natural gas, oil and NGL price derivative contracts. Our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices. The fair value of our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative instruments can fluctuate significantly between periods. Our decision to mitigate cash flow volatility through derivative arrangements, if any, is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions and our desire to stabilize cash flows necessary for the development of our proved reserves. We may choose not to enter into derivatives if the pricing environment for certain time periods is not deemed to be favorable. Additionally, we may choose to liquidate existing derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities to monetize gain positions\nfor the purpose of funding our capital program.\nNatural gas, oil and NGL derivative transactions expose us to the risk that our counterparties, which are generally financial institutions, may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. During periods of declining commodity prices, the value of our commodity derivative asset positions increase, which increases our counterparty exposure. Although the counterparties to our hedging arrangements are required to secure their obligations to us under certain scenarios, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future cash flows being exposed to commodity price changes.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.8 billion in principal amount of debt outstanding, primarily attributable to our senior notes. We also had $292.9 million in borrowings outstanding under our Pre-Petition Revolving Credit Facility and $157.5 million in borrowings under our DIP Credit Facility.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences to you, including the following:\n\u2022our high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including their restrictive covenants, could result in a default under our revolving credit facility or the indentures governing our senior notes;\n\u2022the restrictions imposed on the operation of our business by the terms of our debt agreements may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow our business;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, restructuring, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired, which could be exacerbated by further volatility in the credit markets;\n\u2022our level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited;\n\u2022our high level of indebtedness makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business; and\n\u2022we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as our borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable interest rates.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to pay our expenses and fund our working capital needs and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as commodity prices, other economic conditions and governmental regulation. If our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decreases as a result of lower prices of natural gas, oil or NGL, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities may be limited. To the extent that the value of the collateral pledged under our revolving credit facility declines as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, asset dispositions or otherwise, we may be required to pledge additional collateral to maintain the current availability of the commitments thereunder, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain a sufficiently high valuation to maintain the current borrowing base. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. More specifically, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or litigation. Any of the above risks could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\nOur earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and DIP credit facility. Our revolving credit facility and DIP Credit Facility are structured under floating rate terms. As such, our interest expense is sensitive to fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rate. At December 31, 2020, amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility and DIP Credit Facility bore interest at the weighted average rates of 3.15% and 5.50%, respectively . A 1% increase in the average interest rate would have increased our interest expense by approximately $2.1 million based on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and DIP Credit Facility throughout the year ended December 31, 2020. An increase in our interest rate at the time we have variable interest rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and DIP Credit Facility will increase our costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2020, we did not hedge our interest rate risk.\nWe have significant capital needs, and our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by our debt level and industry conditions.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Low commodity prices have caused and may continue to cause lenders to increase the interest rates under our revolving credit facility, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt around maturity on favorable terms or at all and reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt. Additionally, challenges in the economy have led and could further lead to reductions in the demand for natural gas, oil and NGL, or further reductions in the prices of natural gas, oil and NGL, which could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or are unable to use future borrowings to refinance our indebtedness or fund other capital needs, in each case following our restructuring, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable.\nOur earnings and cash flow could vary significantly from year to year due to the volatility of hydrocarbon commodity prices. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments or to make necessary capital expenditures. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and service our debt. Factors that may cause us to generate cash flow that is insufficient to meet our debt obligations include the events and risks related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. Any cash flow insufficiency would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness following our restructuring, or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our indebtedness, we may be required to undertake various alternative financing plans, which may include:\n\u2022seeking alternative financing or additional capital investment;\n\u2022selling strategic assets;\n\u2022reducing or delaying capital investments; or\n\u2022revising or delaying our strategic plans.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any such alternative financing plans would allow us to meet our debt obligations following our restructuring. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain necessary and sufficient alternative financing, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur development, acquisition and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. To increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities. We have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves.\nHistorically, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, the issuance of equity and debt securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce economically new reserves; and\n\u2022 our ability to borrow under our credit facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2021 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. In addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies.\nUnder our method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties, declines in commodity prices may result in impairment of asset value.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations. Accordingly, all costs, including nonproductive costs and certain general and administrative costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, are capitalized. Net capitalized costs are limited to the estimated future net revenues, after income taxes, discounted at 10% per year, from proved oil and natural gas reserves and the cost of the properties not subject to amortization. Such capitalized costs, including the estimated future development costs and site remediation costs, if any, are depleted by an equivalent units-of-production method, converting natural gas to barrels at the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil.\nCompanies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of the oil and gas properties. Net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (a) estimated future net revenues, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved reserves, based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the closing prices on the first day of each month for the 12-month period ending at the balance sheet date, adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives, if any, that hedge oil and natural gas revenue, excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet, (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, if any, and (c) the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost\nbeing amortized, less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties. If the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or noncash writedown is required. A ceiling test impairment can result in a significant loss for a particular period. Once incurred, a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date, even if oil or gas prices increase. As a result of the decline in commodity prices, we recorded a ceiling test impairment of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. If prices of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids continue to decrease, we will be required to further write down the value of our oil and natural gas properties. Future non-cash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations.\nA change of control could limit our use of net operating losses to reduce future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a net operating loss, or NOL, carryforward of approximately $1.9 billion for federal income tax purposes. If we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the \"Code\"), our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs generated prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. In general, an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which such ownership change occurs. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period. On April 30, 2020, the board of directors of the Company adopted a tax benefits preservation plan in order to protect against a possible limitation on the Company\u2019s ability to use its tax net operating losses and certain other tax benefits to reduce potential future U.S. federal income tax obligations. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to prevent against such an ownership change by deterring any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company\u2019s securities.\nIndustry, Business and Operational Risks\nThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, buying and selling reserves and leases, obtaining goods and services needed to operate our business and marketing natural gas, oil or NGL. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and, due to our debt levels and other factors, may have greater access to the capital and credit markets. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. As a result, these competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively or weather industry downturns more easily than we can. We also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar and electric power.\nOur performance depends largely on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals and on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. If we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining skilled employees and managerial talent, our ability to compete effectively may be diminished. We also compete for the equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties. Typically, during times of rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. During these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment and services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nThe actual quantities of and future net revenues from our proved reserves may be less than our estimates.\nThe estimates of our proved reserves and the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves included in this report are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas, oil and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas, oil and NGL reserves is complex and involves significant decisions and assumptions associated with geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each well. Therefore, these estimates are subject to future revisions.\nActual future production, natural gas, oil and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas, oil and NGL reserves most likely will vary from these estimates. Such variations may be significant and could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 41% of our total estimated proved reserves were PUDs and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of PUDs requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. You should be aware that the estimated development costs may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, further decreases in commodity prices or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. If we choose not to develop our PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC's reserve reporting rules, because PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nYou should not assume that the present values included in this report represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimates of our present values are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimates. The price on the date of estimate is calculated as the average natural gas and oil price during the 12 months ending in the current reporting period, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period. The December 31, 2020 present value is based on a $1.99 per MMBtu of gas price and a $39.54 per Bbl of oil price, before considering basis differential adjustments. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of an estimate.\nActual future net revenues from our oil and natural gas properties will also be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. Any changes in demand for oil and natural gas, governmental regulations or taxation will also affect the future net cash flows from our production. In addition, the 10% discount factor that is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. Interest rates in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the 10% discount factor.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have a substantial inventory of undeveloped properties. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. Acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the\nproperty. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nWe acquire significant amounts of unproven properties that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that undeveloped properties acquired by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive, or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such undeveloped properties or wells.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. Drilling and completion operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, title problems, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of midstream transportation, equipment or personnel, environmental issues, state or local bans or moratoriums on hydraulic fracturing and produced water disposal, and a decline in commodity prices, among others. The profitability of wells, particularly in certain of the areas in which we operate, will be reduced or eliminated if commodity prices decline. In addition, wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets, which are dependent upon the current and future market prices for natural gas, oil and NGL, costs associated with producing natural gas, oil and NGL and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost. Drilling results in our newer oil and liquids-rich shale plays may be more uncertain than in shale plays that are more developed and have longer established production histories, and we can provide no assurance that drilling and completion techniques that have proven to be successful in other shale formations to maximize recoveries will be ultimately successful when used in newly developed shale formations. All costs of development and exploratory drilling activities are capitalized under the full cost method, even if the activities do not result in commercially productive discoveries, which may result in a future impairment of our oil and natural gas properties if commodity prices decrease.\nWe rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other technologies in evaluating undeveloped properties and in conducting our exploration activities. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively, prior to acquisition of undeveloped properties, or drilling a well, whether oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. If we incur significant expense in acquiring or developing properties that do not produce as expected or at profitable levels, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques; therefore, the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.\nOur operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. In addition, to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling, those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations. Furthermore, certain of the development activities we employ, such as offset drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of offset drilling, adjacent wells being shut in and, in the case of multi-well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas, such as our SCOOP play in Oklahoma. The area was historically developed by vertical wells drilled through multiple stacked reservoirs and recent development has focused on the Woodford formation; however, development in the Sycamore and Springer formations has been limited. As emerging formations, our drilling results in this area are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have been producing for a longer period of time. Since limited production history from horizontal wells in the SCOOP Sycamore and Springer formations exists over our acreage position, it is difficult to predict our\nfuture drilling results.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, or declines in natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expiration to hold the acreage by production. In highly competitive markets for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage could result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells, we could lose our rights under such leases. Although 74% of our Utica acreage is held by existing production, the remaining acreage is subject to expiration. Of the remaining 26% of our Utica acreage not held by production, 24% will be subject to expiration in 2021, 29% in 2022, 30% in 2023 and 17% thereafter, although our Utica leases generally grant us the right to extend these leases for an additional five-year period. Although 99% of our SCOOP acreage is held by existing production, the remaining acreage is subject to expiration. Of the remaining 1% of our SCOOP acreage not held by production, 78% will be subject to expiration in 2021, 12% in 2022, 5% in 2023 and 5% thereafter. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Low commodity prices may cause us to delay our drilling plans and, as a result, lose our right to develop the related properties. The cost to renew expiring leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to fund renewals of expiring leases, we could lose portions of our acreage and our actual drilling activities may differ materially from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business.\nOil and natural gas operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks. Operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits.\nOur oil and natural gas operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling for oil, natural gas and NGL can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. While both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. For the 11% of our daily production volumes from properties which we did not serve as operator as of December 31, 2020, we are dependent on the operator for operational and regulatory compliance. In addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;\n\u2022loss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, as well as the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;\n\u2022risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and extreme temperatures;\n\u2022issues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022restricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained\ndownstream markets;\n\u2022environmental hazards or liabilities, including liabilities for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us;\n\u2022restrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations;\n\u2022shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment; and\n\u2022unexpected or unforeseen changes in regulatory policy, and political or public opinions.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities.\nWhile we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. For certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism and piracy, we have limited or no insurance coverage. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are not the operator of all of our oil and natural gas properties and therefore are not in a position to control the timing of development efforts, the associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves on such properties.\nWe are not the operator of all of the properties in which we have an interest, and have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of such non-operated properties or their associated costs. Dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects, and limited ability to influence operations and associated costs, could prevent the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of development and exploration activities on properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022the availability of suitable drilling equipment, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022the operator's expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022selection of technology; and\n\u2022the rate of production of the reserves.\nIn addition, when we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil or natural gas project, if we are not willing or able to fund our capital expenditures relating to such projects when required by the majority owner or operator, our interests in these projects may be reduced or forfeited.\nOil and natural gas production operations, especially those using hydraulic fracturing, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Our ability to produce natural gas, oil and NGL economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling, and in particular, hydraulic fracturing, process. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. For water sourcing, we first seek to use non-potable water supplies for our operational needs. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. An inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. The imposition of new environmental regulations could further restrict our ability to conduct\noperations such as hydraulic fracturing by restricting the disposal of things such as produced water and drilling fluids.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are located in Eastern Ohio and Oklahoma, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in these regions.\nOur largest fields by production are located in Eastern Ohio and Oklahoma. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production in these geographic regions caused by weather conditions such as snow, ice, fog, rain, hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters or lack of field infrastructure. Losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of any existing insurance coverage. We may not be able to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable and it is possible that certain types of coverage may not be available.\nThe loss of one or more of the purchasers of our production could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe largest purchaser of our oil and natural gas during the year ended December 31, 2020 accounted for approximately 12% of our total natural gas, oil and NGL revenues. If this purchaser or one or more other significant purchasers, are unable to satisfy its contractual obligations, we may be unable to sell such production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable. Further, the inability of one or more of our customers to pay amounts owed to us could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. In accordance with customary industry practice, we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells. If we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, trucking and gathering system capacity constraints and may be subject to interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas lines and transportation barges owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied. In certain resource plays, the capacity of gathering and transportation systems is insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. A significant disruption in the availability of these transportation facilities or our compression and other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations.\nWith respect to our Utica acreage where we are focusing a portion of our exploration and development activity, historically there has been no or only limited infrastructure in this area and the commencement of production from our initial and subsequent wells on our Utica acreage has been delayed due to challenges in obtaining rights-of-way and acquiring necessary state and federal permitting and the completion of facilities by our midstream service provider. Capital constraints could limit the construction of new pipelines and gathering systems and the providing or expansion of trucking services by third parties in the Utica and the other areas in which we operate. Until this new capacity is available, we may experience delays in producing and selling our natural gas, oil and NGL. In such event, we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity or sell natural gas, oil or NGL production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our natural gas, oil and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could materially adversely affect our cash flow.\nOur forecasted production is less than our firm transportation commitment levels under our firm transportation contracts due to decreased developmental activities, which will result in excess firm transportation costs and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had entered into firm transportation contracts to deliver approximately 1,399,000 and 1,467,000 MMBtu per day for 2021 and 2022, respectively. Under these firm transportation contracts, we are obligated to deliver minimum daily volumes or pay fees for any deficiencies in deliveries. As a result of the reduced production from our Utica or SCOOP acreage due to decreased developmental activities, taking into consideration the current low commodity price environment, we expect that we will be unable to meet our obligations under the existing firm transportation contracts, resulting in fees, which may be significant and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has affected and may materially adversely affect, and any future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases may materially adversely affect, our operations, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 has affected, and may materially adversely affect, our business and financial and operating results. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. In 2020, the outbreak has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and COVID-19 or another similar outbreak could negatively impact our business in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022our revenue may be reduced if the outbreak results in an economic downturn or recession, as many experts predict, to the extent it leads to a prolonged decrease in the demand for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, NGL and oil;\n\u2022our operations may be disrupted or impaired, thus lowering our production level, if a significant portion of our employees or contractors are unable to work due to illness or if our field operations are suspended or temporarily shut-down or restricted due to control measures designed to contain the outbreak;\n\u2022the operations of our midstream service providers, on whom we rely for the transmission, gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced natural gas, oil and NGL, may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing the outbreak, and/or the difficult economic environment may lead to the bankruptcy or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers, which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our produced natural gas, oil and NGL or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties; and\n\u2022the disruption and instability in the financial markets and the uncertainty in the general business environment may affect our ability to execute on our business strategy, including our focus on reducing our leverage profile. If we are not able to successfully execute our plan to reduce our leverage profile, our high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including their restrictive covenants, could result in a default under our revolving credit facility or the indentures governing our senior notes. Additionally, our credit ratings may be lowered, we may reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or investments, and we may revise or delay our strategic plans.\nWe expect that the principal areas of operational risk for us are availability of service providers and supply chain disruption. Active development operations, including drilling and fracking operations, represent the greatest risk for transmission given the number of personnel and contractors on site. While we believe that we are following best practices under COVID-19 guidance, the potential for transmission still exists. In certain instances, it may be necessary or determined advisable for us to delay development operations.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and caused negative pressure in the capital and credit markets. As a result, we may experience difficulty accessing the capital or financing needed to fund our exploration and production operations, which have substantial capital requirements, or refinance our upcoming maturities on satisfactory terms or at all. We typically fund our capital expenditures with existing cash and cash generated by operations (which is subject to a number of variables, including many beyond our control) and, to the extent our capital expenditures exceed our cash resources, from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other external sources of capital. If our cash flows from operations or the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to fund our capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain the capital necessary for our planned capital budget or our operations, we could be required to curtail our operations and the development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in Item 1A., \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as those relating to our financial performance and debt obligations. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business, which will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for natural gas, NGL and oil, the response of the overall economy and the financial markets as well as the effect of governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic.\nA deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and the European, Asian and the United States financial markets have contributed to economic volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy. Historically, concerns about global economic growth have had a significant impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and materially adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nTerrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign attacks, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices, or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. These factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have in the past precipitated, and may in the future precipitate, an economic slowdown.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry and related regulations may adversely impact our operations and, if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, our business may be harmed.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our customers, employees and third-party partners. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s, supplier\u2019s or royalty owners\u2019 data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nIn addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe ultimate outcome of pending legal and governmental proceedings is uncertain, and there are significant costs associated with these matters.\nWe are defending against claims by royalty owners alleging, among other things, that we underpaid royalty owners. The resolution of disputes regarding past payments could cause our future obligations to royalty owners to increase and would negatively impact our future results of operations.\nThe outcome of any pending or future litigation or governmental regulatory matter is uncertain and may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we have incurred substantial legal expenses in the past three years, and such expenses may continue to be significant in the future. Further, attention to these matters by members of our senior management has been required, reducing the time they have available to devote to managing our business.\nDecisions by the Ohio Supreme Court interpreting the Ohio Dormant Mineral Act relating to preservation of mineral rights by surface owners could require certain curative efforts to vest title in a portion of our leasehold acreage, increase our leasehold expenses, subject us to payment of additional royalties or result in the loss of some of our leasehold acreage in Ohio.\nOn September 15, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a series of decisions relating to the Ohio Dormant Mineral Act, which we refer to as the ODMA. In the lead case, Corban v. Chesapeake Exploration L.L.C., the court concluded that the 1989 version of the ODMA did not transfer ownership of dormant mineral rights automatically, by operation of law. Instead, prior to 2006, surface owners were required to bring a quiet title action to establish abandonment of mineral rights. After June 30, 2006, (the effective date of the 2006 version of the ODMA), surface owners are required to follow the statutory notice and recording procedures enacted in 2006. We have assessed the impact of these recent Ohio Supreme Court decisions on our operations in Ohio where the majority of our acreage and our producing properties are located and have taken steps to mitigate any potential risks identified as a result of our assessment. However, the Ohio Supreme Court decisions could require certain curative efforts to vest title in a portion of our leasehold acreage, increase our leasehold expense, subject us to payment of additional royalties or result in the loss of some of our leasehold acreage in Ohio, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation and ongoing regulatory changes, which could adversely impact our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and NGL, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations. If permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. For example, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order effectively suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. Then on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. To the extent that the review results in the development of additional restrictions on drilling, limitations on the availability of leases, or restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, we may be required to make large, sometimes unexpected, expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders.\nIn addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. Regulatory changes could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, alter environmental protection requirements and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to the government. Our operating and compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. We do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity. As is discussed below this is particularly true of changes related to pipeline safety, seismic activity, hydraulic fracturing, climate change and endangered species designations.\nPipeline Safety. The pipeline assets owned by our midstream service providers are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas, NGL and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids, such as oil, that, in the event of a failure, could affect \u201chigh consequence areas.\u201d Recent PHMSA rules have also extended certain requirements for integrity assessments and leak detections beyond high consequence areas. Further, legislation funding PHMSA through 2023 requires the agency to engage in additional rulemaking to amend the integrity management program, emergency response plan, operation and maintenance manual, and pressure control recordkeeping requirements for gas distribution operators; to create new leak detection and repair program obligations; and to set new minimum federal safety standards for onshore gas gathering lines. At this time, we cannot predict the cost of these requirements or other potential new or amended regulations, but they could be significant, and any such costs incurred by our midstream service providers could result in increased midstream gathering and processing expenses for us. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations by our midstream service providers could result in the imposition of significant penalties which may impact the cost or availability of pipeline capacity necessary for our operations.\nSeismic Activity. Earthquakes in some of our operating areas and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry. For example, the OCC issued guidance to operators in the SCOOP and STACK areas for management of certain seismic activity that may be related to hydraulic fracturing or water disposal activities. Legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In addition, we could be subject to third-party lawsuits seeking damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation.\nHydraulic Fracturing. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Three states (New York, Maryland and Vermont) have banned the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. There have also been certain governmental reviews that focus on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices, including hydraulic fracturing. Governments may continue to study hydraulic fracturing. We cannot predict the outcome of future studies, but based on the results of these studies to date, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. A decision is pending.\nWe cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, our business and operations could be subject to delays, increased operating and compliance costs and potential bans. Additional regulation could also lead to greater opposition to hydraulic fracturing, including litigation.\nClimate Change. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories, limitations or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. Several states where we operate have imposed venting and flaring limitations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of cap and trade or carbon tax programs. Renewable energy standards (also referred to as renewable portfolio standards) require electric utilities to provide a specified minimum percentage of electricity from eligible renewable resources, with potential increases to the required percentage over time. The development of a federal renewable energy standard, or the development of additional or more stringent renewable energy standards at the state level could reduce the demand for oil and gas, thereby adversely impacting our earnings, cash flows and financial position. Cap and trade programs offer greenhouse gas emission allowances that are gradually reduced over time. A cap and trade program or expanded use of cap and trade programs at the state level could impose direct costs on us through the purchase of allowances and could impose indirect costs by incentivizing consumers to shift away from fossil fuels. In addition, federal or state carbon taxes could directly increase our costs of operation and similarly incentivize consumers to shift away from fossil fuels.\nIn addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of\nfunding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Members of the investment community have also begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance, including practices related to greenhouse gases and climate change, before investing in our common units. Any efforts to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, and we may be forced to implement technologies that are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to meet the specific requirements to perform services for certain customers.\nThese various legislative, regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, including by imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations, which could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas, which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nEndangered Species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the taking of endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in material compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we intend to conduct construction activity or the imposition of seasonal restrictions on our construction or operational activities could materially limit or delay our plans.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states, including in Oklahoma, alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells.\nIn our Utica and SCOOP operations, we make an effort to reuse/recycle all produced water from production and completion activities through our fracture stimulation operations when active. While our objective is to recycle or share 100% of all produced water, we do inject water into third-party commercially operated disposal wells in line with all state and federal mandated practices and cease produced water recycle whenever fracture stimulation operations are idle once sharing opportunities with other operators have been exhausted. In the state of Ohio, all water used during drilling operations is disposed of through injection into third-party salt water disposal wells regulated by applicable state agencies.\nFuture U.S. and state tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and gas industry. For example, legislative proposals have been introduced in the U.S. Congress in the past that, if enacted, would (i) eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) repeal the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, and (iii) extend the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. In addition, at the state level, legislative changes imposing increased taxes on oil and gas production have periodically been considered in Ohio and Oklahoma. These proposed changes in the U.S. federal and state tax law, if adopted, or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration, development or similar activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and protection is constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs as we collect and store personal data related to royalty owners. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and enhanced consumer protections for those individuals, and provides for statutory fines for data security breaches or other CCPA violations. Meanwhile, over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the CCPA. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, require us to change our business practices, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business should we fail to comply with any such applicable laws.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in heightened risk of litigation, including private rights of action, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of cyber incidents or attacks, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nWe may have material liability related to plugging and abandonment, reclamation, civil lawsuits and regulatory fines associated with our divested Louisiana assets.\nGulfport operated hundreds of wells in Louisiana before divesting substantially all Louisiana assets to PEL Gulf Coast, LLC (\u201cPerdido\u201d) in 2019. The Perdido Purchase Sale Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d) contains a broad assumption of all obligations, as well as defense and indemnity obligations, in favor of Gulfport and against Perdido for all current and former Gulfport wells. To the extent Perdido files for bankruptcy protection or is unable to meet its obligations, Gulfport may have material liability related to plugging and abandonment, reclamation, civil lawsuits and regulatory fines.", "PERMNO": 91128, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GPOR"}
