{"cik": "1375063", "company": "SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks which may negatively impact our business interests on a go-forward basis. These risks should be carefully considered prior to, or continuing, investment in our Company. To assist in the understanding of these risks, we have broken down the risks into four main categories all of which could materially impact our financial operations or our financial position:\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe will require substantial additional funding, and our failure to raise additional capital necessary to support and expand our operations could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had $0.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $34,000 of working capital.\nAs of January 10, 2020, we had $0.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Of the $0.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $347,000 resides in the United States or easily accessed foreign countries and approximately $40,000 resides in China.\nAs a result of our efforts evaluating financing and strategic options, on October 10, 2019 we entered into the Merger Agreement with AFE. Currently our focus is on completing the steps required to complete the Merger, which include but are not limited to, (i) completion of all required filings, (ii) curing the NASDAQ listing requirement deficiencies, (iii) completion of the Form S-4 and Proxy related to the merger, (iv) completion of the Batchfire Share Exchange pre-emptive rights process and (v) all other tasks required to complete the Merger.\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, we entered into a securities purchase and exchange agreements (each, a \u201cNew Purchase Agreements\u201d) with each of the existing holders of our 11% senior secured debentures issued in October 2017 (the \u201cDebentures\u201d), whereby each of the holders agreed to exchange their Debentures and accompanying warrants (the \u201cDebenture Warrants\u201d) for new debentures (the \u201cNew Debentures\u201d) and warrants (the \u201cNew Warrants\u201d), and certain of the holders agreed to provide $2,000,000 of additional debt financing (the \u201cInterim Financing\u201d). Pursuant to the New Purchase Agreements, we also issued $2,000,000 of 11% senior secured debentures (the \u201cMerger Debentures\u201d) to certain accredited investors, along with warrants to purchase $4,000,000 of shares of common stock, half of which were Series A Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the \u201cSeries A Merger Warrants\u201d) and half of which were Series B Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the \u201cSeries B Merger Warrants\u201d and, together with the Series A Merger Warrants, the \u201cMerger Warrants\u201d), as part of the Interim Financing. We shall receive the $2,000,000 pursuant to the Merger Debentures according to the following schedule: (i) $1,000,000 on or before October 14, 2019, (ii) $500,000 upon the filing of the proxy statement for stockholder approval of the Merger, and (iii) $500,000 within two business days of stockholder approval of the Merger. The terms of the Merger Debentures are the same as the New Debentures. The Interim Financing is intended to assist us in financing our business through the closing of the Merger.\nThe $1,000,000 scheduled payment on or before October 14, 2019 was subsequently received less certain legal costs and escrow fees in the amount of $966,000.\nWe can make no assurances that the proposed Merger will be completed on a timely basis or at all. We may also need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing to complete the Merger or to otherwise strengthen our balance for our corporate general and administrative expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all. Any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may further reduce our expenses and we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels including retention of key personnel and consultants; (ii) successfully implement our business strategy; (iii) make additional capital contributions to our joint ventures; (iv) fund certain obligations as they become due; (v) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements; or (vi) repay our indebtedness. In addition, we may elect to sell certain investments as a source of cash to develop additional projects or for general corporate purposes. We may be forced to seek relief to avoid or end insolvency through other proceedings including bankruptcy. Based on the historical negative cash flows and the continued limited cash inflows in the period subsequent to year end there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our recently issued Debentures, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory conditions and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, including our recently issued Debentures, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, including payments on our recently issued Debentures, and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.\nWe may not be successful in developing our business platform in Australia.\nAll of our business in Australia is currently being conducted by AFE and as such, we are dependent on the ability of AFE to grow and develop its pending and contemplated projects, and to secure debt and equity financing for projects. We will only receive fees for projects with AFE when agreed milestones across the development, design, construction, start-up and operations of the project are achieved. These projects will have a number of risks and could present unexpected challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies that arise during or after the development of the project. We cannot assure you that AFE will be able to complete the necessary financings, or once completed satisfy the conditions required to achieve these milestones or be able to enter into relationships with partners which can finance and develop the projects to completion. In addition, we can make no assurances that AFE will have sufficient and timely cash flows to continue its operations in the absence of a financing. The failure to complete the financings and, achieve the milestones or for the projects to be fully developed would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nOur size and lack of resources could inhibit the development of our third-party licensing business.\nSGT license and equipment supply agreements will typically provide a guarantee of the performance of the SGT systems used in a project. Due to our limited resources and lack of financial strength, we may not be able to provide adequate financial support required to guarantee our technology performance in a project. As a result, this can impact the ability to complete equity and debt financing of projects and prevent us from securing orders. This outcome would hinder the development of our third-party licensing business and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful developing opportunities to license our technology.\nAlthough we have identified potential opportunities in Australia, Eastern Europe, South America, the Caribbean, China and other parts of Asia, our licensing and related service business are based on our ability to secure contractual commitments from our potential customers to utilize our technology in their projects. These projects are generally capital intensive, require government approvals and can take two to five years or more to complete their development and construction. Our ability to secure orders for our technology is subject to many uncertainties associated with our customers completing a go or no-go decision to develop and invest in these projects. Additionally, successfully developing global licensing opportunities for our technology is subject to the uncertainty of global markets as well as our continued capability to deliver technology licenses, components and services, as well as the capability of regional platform companies that we develop, like AFE, to fund, develop and complete both equity and debt financing for the projects that will use our technology and related services. In addition, as with our other projects, we will be exposed to the risk of financial non-performance by our customers. Although we anticipate that we can generate revenues through engineering and technical service fees, as well as licensing fees and royalties on products sold by our licensees that incorporate our proprietary technology, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with our strategic partners for project development.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with our strategic partners to accelerate our expansion, fund our development efforts, better understand market practices and regulatory issues and more effectively handle challenges that may arise.\nThrough the TSEC Joint Venture, we have partnered a significant portion of our China business with STT, a Chinese company which desires to invest into the growth of China\u2019s clean energy space and ICCDI previously served as general contractor and engineered and constructed all three projects for the Aluminum Corporation of China, which recognizes the opportunity afforded by our technology capability and business model. We have committed to execute all of our business in Australia through AFE and in Poland through SEE. We believe partnering with companies such as STT and ICCDI and setting up companies like AFE and SEE with strong local partners, can increase the acceptance of our technology on a global basis and will enable us to reduce our capital requirements to achieve this acceleration.\nWe may also seek additional partners in the future for our technology platforms. Our future success will depend on these relationships and any other strategic relationships that we may enter into. We cannot assure you that we will satisfy the conditions required to maintain these relationships under existing agreements or that we can prevent the termination of these agreements. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into relationships with future strategic partners on acceptable terms. Further, we cannot assure you that our joint venture partners, including STT and ICCDI, AFE, and SEE will grow effectively meet their development objectives.\nWe may not be successful developing our technology and licensing business.\nThe development of our licensing and technology business depends, in part, on our ability to form strategic relationships with other partners which can extend our global sales reach for our technology and licensing business and retaining key technical personnel to work on that business for us. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully develop our strategic partnerships or successfully grow the TSEC Joint Venture, our exclusive provider of technology and licensing in China, Mongolia, Indonesia, Vietnam, The Philippines, and Malaysia, which depends upon several factors, including the strength of global energy and chemical markets, commodity prices and the ability of our strategic partners to timely perform their obligations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to succeed in developing or sustaining these relationships, or continue to retain the necessary employees, and our inability to do so could result in ending our licensing business which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nJoint ventures, partnerships, and companies that we enter into present a number of challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have developed projects in China with the ZZ Joint Venture, the Yima Joint Venture, and our TSEC Joint Venture. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we plan to enter into other joint ventures or similar transactions, including as part of our business verticals some of which may be material. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies that arise after entering into the joint venture related to the counterparties to such joint ventures, with whom we share control. We could experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems due to challenges, including problems related to execution or integration. In some cases, our joint venture partner may have a contractual commitment to provide funding to the joint venture, although we do not have assurances that they will satisfy such obligations. Economic uncertainty in China, Eastern Europe, Australia, or other parts of the world in which we plan to do business, could also cause delays or make financing of operations more difficult. Any of these risks could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAll of our business in Australia is currently being conducted through AFE and as such, we are dependent on the ability of AFE to grow and develop its pending and contemplated projects. AFE will need to raise additional funds to move their project development efforts forward. We will only receive fees for projects with AFE, if they are successful in their fundraising efforts, and when agreed milestones across the development, design, construction, start-up and operations of the project are achieved. These projects will have a number of risks and could present unexpected challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies that arise during or after the development of the project. We cannot assure you that AFE will satisfy the conditions required to achieve these milestones or that AFE will be able to enter into relationships with partners which can finance and develop the projects to completion. The failure to achieve the milestones or for the projects to be fully developed would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAll of our business in Poland is currently being conducted through SEE and as such, we are dependent on the ability of SEE to grow and develop its pending and contemplated projects. SEE will need to raise additional funds to move their project development efforts forward. We will only receive fees for projects with SEE if they are successful in their fundraising efforts and when agreed milestones across the development, design, construction, start-up and operations of the project are achieved. These projects will have a number of risks and could present unexpected challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies that arise during or after the development of the project. We cannot assure you that SEE will satisfy the conditions required to achieve these milestones or that SEE will be able to enter into relationships with partners which can finance and develop the projects to completion. The failure to achieve the milestones or for the projects to be fully developed would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we are a minority owner in the Yima Joint Venture. We have failed to demonstrate that we can significantly influence the decision making of the joint venture. Therefore, we rely on our joint venture partner to provide management and operational support for the joint venture. Accordingly, the Yima Joint Venture investment\u2019s success is completely dependent upon the Yima management. We have relied, and will continue to rely, upon personnel in China to compile this information and deliver it to us in a timely fashion so that the information can be incorporated into our consolidated financial statements prior to the due dates for our annual and quarterly reports. Any difficulties or delays in receiving this information or incorporating it into our consolidated financial statements in the future could impair our ability to timely file our annual and quarterly reports.\nDependence on owners of future projects in which we have a minority interest, or extended negotiations regarding the scope of the projects, could delay or prevent the realization of targeted returns on our capital invested in these projects.\nWe may be subject to future impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.\nWe evaluate the conditions of our assets on an annual basis or upon the determination that an other-than-temporary decrease in value has occurred. If management determines that there were applicable triggering events which are other-than-temporary in nature, management will conduct an impairment analysis utilizing using various valuation techniques, such as, a discounted cash flow fair market valuation, a Black-Scholes Model-Fair Value of Optionality used in valuing companies with substantial amounts of debt where a discounted cash flow valuation may be inadequate for estimating fair value, or a Monte Carlo Simulation or a combination of different techniques with the assistance of a third-party valuation expert. In these types of valuations, significant unobservable inputs were used to calculate the fair value of the investment. As of June 30, 2019, and 2018, management determined there were other-than-temporary events and conducted impairment valuations. As a result of the valuations, we impaired our assets and may be required to do so in the future.\nEconomic uncertainty could negatively impact our business, limit our access to the credit and equity markets, increase the cost of capital, and may have other negative consequences that we cannot predict.\nGlobal economic uncertainty and the underlying access to credit and equity markets could create financial challenges for us and the economy as a whole. Our internally generated cash flow and cash on hand historically have not been sufficient to fund all of our expenditures, and we have relied on, among other things, bank financings and private equity to provide us with additional capital. Our ability to access capital may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital. If our cash flow from operations is less than anticipated and our access to capital is restricted, we may be required to reduce our operating and capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and future operations. Ongoing uncertainty may also reduce the values we are able to realize in asset sales or other transactions we may engage in to raise capital, thus making these transactions more difficult and less economic to consummate.\nOur results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate.\nOur operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Factors that may affect our operating results and cash flows include but are not limited to: (i) the ability of our Australian and Polish businesses, through AFE, SEE and BFR, to develop and provide the contemplated returns on our investment; (ii) the success of the Yima Joint Venture and their ability to improve operations and overcome the current cash flow concerns of their operations; (iii) our ability to obtain new customers and retain existing customers; (iv) the success and acceptance of our technology; (v) our ability to successfully distribute cash out of China; (vi) our ability to successfully develop additional regional platforms similar to AFE and SEE in other parts of the world, and our ability to successfully develop our licensing business verticals , as well as execute on our projects; (vii) the ability to obtain financing for our projects; (viii) the cost of coal, electricity, and natural gas; (ix) shortages of equipment, raw materials or feedstock; (x) approvals by various government agencies; and (xi) general economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the energy industry.\nAn inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently have all of the personnel to fully develop and execute on all of our business opportunities, including our various business verticals and other partnering arrangements. Also, our technology design and implementation capability rely on years of gasification specific and U-GAS\u00ae specific experience and expertise in key staff members. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability, as well as the ability of our joint ventures, to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous other companies, some of which have far greater resources than we do. We may be unable to identify, attract and retain suitably qualified individuals, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we were to be unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to grow and diversify, which in turn will require that we manage and control our growth effectively.\nOur business strategy contemplates growth and diversification. As we add to our services, our number of customers, and our marketing and sales efforts, operating expenses and capital requirements will increase. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require that we continue to expend funds to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we must effectively recruit new employees, and once hired, train and manage them. From time to time, we may also have discussions with respect to potential acquisitions, some of which may be material, in order to further grow and diversify our business. However, acquisitions are subject to a number of risks and challenges, including difficulty of integrating the businesses, adverse effects on our earnings, existence of unknown liabilities or contingencies and potential disputes with counterparties. We will be unable to manage our business effectively if we are unable to alleviate the strain on resources caused by growth in a timely and successful manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growth and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe or our partners will manage the design, procurement and construction of our plants. If our or their management of these issues fail, our business and operating results could suffer.\nPreviously for our ZZ Joint Venture, and possibly for other projects we may work on in the future, we have or expect to manage plant design as it relates to the gasification systems. Some of this work has been or will be subcontracted to third parties. We are and will be coordinating and supervising these tasks. Although we believe that this is the most time and cost-effective way to build gasification plants, we bear the risk of cost and schedule overruns and quality control. If we do not properly manage the design, procurement and construction of our plants, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. Furthermore, as we continue to improve our technology, we may decide to make changes to our equipment that could further delay the construction of our plants. Additionally, for certain of our projects, including projects for which we provide a license or related service, we will rely on our partners to manage the design, procurement and construction of the plant. The success and timing of work on these projects by others will depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control. We can provide no assurances that the work will be completed timely or at all, or that the work will be performed at standards to our satisfaction.\nDisruption in U.S. and international economic conditions and in the commodity and credit markets may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe global economy may experience another significant contraction, which could impede our ability and the ability of our partners to obtain financing for our projects. This could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in a number of other ways. Any decline in economic conditions may reduce the demand or prices for the production from our plants. Our industry partners and potential customers and suppliers may also experience insolvencies, bankruptcies or similar events. As a direct result of these trends, our ability to finance and develop our existing projects, commence any new projects and sell our products may continue to be adversely impacted. In addition, the increased currency volatility could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Any of the above factors could also adversely affect our ability to access credit or raise capital even if the capital markets improve.\nOur lack of recurring revenue and earnings precludes us from forecasting operating results and our business strategies may not be accepted in the marketplace and may not help us to achieve profitability.\nOur lack of operating history or meaningful revenue precludes us from forecasting operating results based on historical results. Our proposed business strategies described in this annual report incorporate our senior management\u2019s current best analysis of potential markets, opportunities and difficulties that face us. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions accurately reflect current trends in our industry, terms of possible project investments or our customers\u2019 reaction to our products and services or that such products or services will be successful. Our business strategies may and likely will change substantially from time to time as our senior management reassesses its opportunities and reallocates its resources, and any such strategies may be changed or abandoned at any time. If we are unable to develop or implement these strategies through our projects and our technology, we may never achieve profitability which could impair our ability to continue as a going concern. Even if we do achieve profitability, it may not be sustainable, and we cannot predict the level of such profitability.\nWe face the potential inability to protect our intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the proprietary SGT technology originally based on U-GAS\u00ae technology licensed from GTI. All of the original patents granted around U-GAS\u00ae technology have expired and we are improving SGT technology, received some new patents and we have applied for other new patents for these improvements and new technologies. Proprietary rights relating to our technology are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, maintained within trade secrets or maintained in confidence through legally binding agreements. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our technology or gain access to our proprietary information and technical know-how and we may be especially vulnerable to Chinese entities in their attempts to copy all or part of our technology. In addition, we rely on proprietary information and technical know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. In the case of the TSEC Joint Venture, to which we have transferred the exclusive right to our technology within the joint venture territory, we are relying on the covenants and protections included in the TUCA. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nProceedings initiated by us to protect our proprietary rights could result in substantial costs to us. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or that they will not use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe upon our patents. Pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us may relate to our products or technologies. We may need to acquire licenses to, or contest the validity of, any such patents. We cannot assure you that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms or that we would prevail in any such contest. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the availability and cost of low rank coal and coal waste and our inability to obtain a low-cost source could have an impact on our business.\nWe believe that we have the greatest competitive advantage using our technology in situations where there is a ready source of low rank, low cost coal, coal waste or biomass to utilize as a feedstock. We intend to locate projects in areas where low cost coal and coal waste are available or where it can be moved to a project site easily without transportation issues and we are working to develop structured transactions that include securing options to feedstock resources including coal and biomass. The success of our projects and those of our customers will depend on the supply of low rank coal and coal waste. If a source of low cost coal or coal waste for these projects cannot be obtained effectively, our business and operating results could be seriously affected.\nDecreased cost or increased availability for natural gas in Australia, Poland, China and other regions where we develop projects could have an impact on our business and results of operation.\nWe compete with producers of other low-cost fuels used for electricity generation, such as natural gas. Declines in the price of natural gas, or continued low natural gas prices, could cause demand for coal-based energy to decrease and adversely affect the price of syngas and related projects. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices or other fuels may also cause utilities to phase out or close existing coal-fired power plants or reduce construction of new coal-fired power plants. In addition, competition provided by new methods of extracting natural gas could hurt our business in Australia, China and elsewhere around the world. All of this could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe termination of our license agreement with GTI or any of our joint venture agreements or licensing agreements may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe GTI Agreement, our joint ventures in China, our licensing and related service business and our business verticals are essential to us and our future development. With the exercise of our first extension of our agreement in May 2016, the GTI Agreement terminates on August 31, 2026, but may be terminated by GTI upon certain events of default if not cured by us within specified time periods. In addition, after the second ten-year extension period provided under the GTI Agreement, which is exercisable at our option, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining an extension of the term of the license at a royalty rate that we believe to be reasonable or at all. Our joint venture agreements do not terminate for many years but may be terminated earlier due to certain events of bankruptcy or default, and, in the case of the TSEC Joint Venture, if the joint venture does not establish positive net income within 24 months of formation. Termination of any of our joint ventures or other key business relationships would require us to seek another collaborative relationship in that territory. We cannot assure you that a suitable alternative third party would be identified, and even if identified, we cannot assure you that the terms of any new relationship would be commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any of our license agreements could be terminated by our customer if we default under the terms of the agreement and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA portion of our revenues will be derived from the merchant sales of commodities and our inability to obtain satisfactory prices could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn certain circumstances, we or our partners plan to sell methanol, glycol, DME, synthetic gasoline, SNG, ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen, elemental sulphur, ash, acetic acid, propionic acid and other commodities into the merchant market. These sales may not be subject to long term offtake agreements and the price will be dictated by the then prevailing market price. Revenues from such sales may fluctuate and may not be consistent or predictable. In particular, the market for commodities such as methanol is currently under significant pressure and we are unsure of how much longer this will continue. Our business and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to obtain satisfactory prices for these commodities or if prospective buyers do not purchase these commodities.\nWe face intense competition. If we cannot gain market share among our competition, we may not earn revenues and our business may be harmed.\nThe business of providing clean energy is highly competitive. We face completion from other forms of gasification technology, and other competing technologies that include reforming of natural gas for chemicals and hydrogen production, oil refining for fuels production, petroleum byproducts for plastics, precursors such as olefins and conventional natural gas, fuel oil and coal combustion in power generation equipment and other industrial applications. In the gasification market, large multi-national industrial corporations that are better capitalized, such as Air Products (with entrained flow technologies) and; Lurgi (with moving bed technology); and smaller Chinese firms offer coal gasification equipment and services which compete with our technology.\nWhile our technology can provide superior economics than these technologies in most cases, our size, our availability to the capital markets and the lack of commercial operating experience can make it difficult for us to win orders. In addition, new competitors, some of whom may have extensive experience in related fields or greater financial resources, may enter the market.\nIncreased competition could result in a loss of contracts and market share. Either of these results could seriously harm our business and operating results. In addition, there are a number of gasification and conventional, non-gasification, coal-based alternatives for producing heat and power that could compete with our technology in specific situations. If we are unable to effectively compete with other sources of energy, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed.\nOur information technology systems and those of our service providers are subject to our ability to maintain them to avoid cyber security risks and threats.\nWe depend on information technology systems that we manage, and others that are managed by our third-party service and equipment providers, to conduct our operations, and these systems are subject to risks associated with cyber incidents or attacks. It has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted cyber-attacks on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks, breaches to our or our service or equipment providers\u2019 systems could go unnoticed for a prolonged period of time. These cyber security risks could disrupt our operations and result in disruption of our operations, loss of critical data as well as result in higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents. If our or our service or equipment providers\u2019 systems for protecting against cyber incidents or attacks prove to be insufficient and an incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Currently, we do not carry insurance for losses related to cyber security attacks and may elect to not obtain such insurance in the future.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate control legislation and regulatory initiatives.\nRecent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d may be contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to such studies, many countries are actively considering legislation, or have already taken legal measures, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as coal, is an example of a greenhouse gas. Plants using our technology may release a significant amount of carbon dioxide. Methane is another greenhouse gas.\nNew legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business may require us or our customers to obtain additional permits, meet additional control requirements, install additional environmental mitigation equipment, or take other as yet unknown steps to comply with these potential regulations, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Although we plan to use advanced technologies to actively utilize or sequester any greenhouse gas emissions, compliance with any future regulation of greenhouse gases, if it occurs, could be costly and may delay our development of projects. Even if we or our customers obtain all necessary permits, the air quality standards or the interpretation of those standards may change, thus requiring additional control equipment, more stringent permitting requirements, or other measures. Such requirements could significantly increase the operating costs and capital costs associated with any future development, expansion or modification of a plant.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nOur management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn fiscal years ending June 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, we identified material weaknesses over management\u2019s review controls over significant accounting estimates and review controls over accounting for non-routine and complex accounting transactions. A material weakness was identified relating to the impairment evaluation of our cost method investments. We did not effectively operate controls over management\u2019s review of the impairment assessment, including its review of certain elements related to the valuation of our cost basis investments. Additionally, in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, management\u2019s assessment identified an additional material weakness in management\u2019s review controls over non-routine and complex accounting transactions that were caused by a lack of segregation of duties over these types of transactions.\nIn fiscal year June 30, 2019, management has identified material weaknesses over management\u2019s review controls and the lack of segregation of duties over accounting transactions due to the limited resources available.\nWe are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 and the related Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s implementing rules, require that management disclose whether the principal executive officer and principal financial officer maintained internal control over financial reporting that, among other things, provides reasonable assurance that material errors in our external financial reports will be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and that we maintain support for that disclosure that includes evidence of our evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control. We are a small company with international operations, limited financial resources and our finance and accounting staff is very limited.\nIn fiscal years ending June 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, we identified material weaknesses over management\u2019s review controls over significant accounting estimates and review controls over accounting for non-routine and complex accounting transactions. A material weakness was identified relating to the impairment evaluation of our cost method investments. We did not effectively operate controls over management\u2019s review of the impairment assessment, including its review of certain elements related to the valuation of our cost basis investments. Additionally, in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, management\u2019s assessment identified an additional material weakness in management\u2019s review controls over non-routine and complex accounting transactions that were caused by a lack of segregation of duties over these types of transactions.\nIn fiscal year June 30, 2019, management has identified material weaknesses over omplex accounting transactions, and the lack of segregation of duties over these types of transactions and the limited resources available.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully maintain the procedures, certification and attestation requirements of Section 404 or that we or our auditors will not identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, investors could lose confidence in our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nInternational operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.\nThe majority of our operations are located in China and Australia, and we are looking at development opportunities in other countries as well. As a result, a significant portion of our revenue is subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf general strikes and civil unrest;\n\u25cf other changes in political climate and energy-related policy and laws;\n\u25cf the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;\n\u25cf import and export regulations (including in respect of gas);\n\u25cf taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;\n\u25cf price controls;\n\u25cf transportation regulations and tariffs;\n\u25cf constrained methanol markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;\n\u25cf exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;\n\u25cf laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;\n\u25cf the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;\n\u25cf the possible inability to subject foreign person, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.\nForeign countries have occasionally asserted rights to assets held by foreign entities. If a country claims superior rights to our assets, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Various regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability. The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on our industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes, or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of feedstock supplies and markets, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including production facilities, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.\nForeign investment regulations could adversely impact our company and subject us to fines.\nMany nations, both developing and developed countries, have stringent laws which are related to the investment and re-patriotization of funds from profits within their respective countries and which may inhibit or prevent us from removing funds from the country in which the investment was made and could potentially impact our liquidity.\nFor example, Chinese regulations relating to outbound investment activities, in particular, round-tripping investments by Chinese residents may increase our administrative burden, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activity or otherwise adversely affect the implementation of our acquisition strategy. If Chinese residents, who are beneficial holders of our shares, make or have previously made direct or indirect round tripping investments through a SPV which falls within the scope of the registration under the SAFE Circular [2014] 37 (SAFE Circular [2014] 37 Relating to Foreign Exchange Administration of Offshore Investment, Financing and Round tripping Investment by Domestic Residents utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles), the Chinese residents must make foreign exchange registration for their offshore investments, otherwise, the Chinese residents may be ordered to return the capital to China and be imposed a fine by SAFE for such misconduct. At the time of applying for SAFE registration (including any change registration), the foreign-invested enterprises that do not constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to represent that its foreign shareholder is not directly or indirectly held by any Chinese residents; the foreign-invested enterprises that constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to disclose the actual controlling person of its foreign shareholder. Any false or misleading representations may result in administrative liabilities imposed on the onshore entities and their legal representatives. We cannot provide any assurances that all of our stockholders who are Chinese residents will make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by these SAFE regulations. The failure or inability of our Chinese resident stockholders to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the SAFE regulations may subject our Chinese subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, or limit the ability to distribute dividends to or obtain foreign-exchange dominated loans from our company. Given that SAFE [2014] Circular 37 is a newly issued regulation, certain aspects therein still remain in uncertainty. As it is uncertain how the SAFE regulations will be interpreted or implemented, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and obtaining foreign currency denominated borrowings, which may harm our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we decide to acquire a Chinese domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the SAFE regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIn relation to our Australian operations, the Australian Government regulates investments by foreign persons in certain companies, trusts, businesses and land under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act (\u201cFATA\u201d). This regime requires notification of the proposed acquisition to the Australian Treasurer, through the Foreign Investment Review Board (\u201cFIRB\u201d) and obtaining a no objections notification (\u201cFIRB approval\u201d) in respect of certain investments made by foreign persons. Under the FATA, we are considered a foreign person. Similarly, due to our ownership position in AFE, AFE will also be considered a foreign person under the FATA. This means that if we or AFE decide to acquire an Australian company, trust, business or interest in Australian land (which includes an interest in mining and production tenements), such an acquisition may require FIRB approval if it meets the relevant FATA thresholds. Also, due to the Australia - United States Free Trade Agreement, United States investors are considered \u201cagreement country investors\u201d under the FATA. The \u201cagreement country investors\u201d are subject to much higher FATA thresholds which means that United States investors can make significantly larger investments without needing to seek FIRB approval. However, we can only benefit from these higher FATA thresholds if we use entities incorporated or established in United States to directly make the proposed investment. The Treasurer will only grant FIRB approval if he can be satisfied that the proposed investment is not contrary to the Australian national interest. We cannot provide any assurances that we or AFE, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary FIRB approvals in relation to proposed acquisitions that meet the FATA thresholds. However, rejections of proposed investments are rare.\nFurthermore, depending on the proportion of our shares that are beneficially held by government-related entities at any one time, we, and in turn AFE, may be considered a foreign government investor under the FATA. Foreign government investors are subject to lower FATA thresholds and greater scrutiny by FIRB in relation to their proposed acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will always be able to accurately identify whether we are a foreign government investor under the FATA.\nFailure to obtain FIRB approval when required or otherwise comply with the FATA may subject us to fines and a range of legal sanctions, including orders requiring us to dispose of the relevant interest (in relation to interests that have been acquired without FIRB approval). This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIn our areas of operation, the projects we and our customers intend to build are subject to rigorous environmental regulations, review and approval. We cannot assure you that such approvals will be obtained, applicable requirements will be satisfied or approvals, once granted, will be maintained.\nOur operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, sitting of facilities or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as various Chinese, Polish and Australian authorities at the municipal, state/provincial or central government level and similar regulatory bodies in other countries, issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial potential administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before construction and/or operations at a facility commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with such activities, limit or prohibit construction activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas and impose substantial liabilities for pollution. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although to date we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with existing environmental requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not suffer such effects in the future or that projects developed by our partners or customers will not suffer such effects.\nAlthough we have been successful in obtaining the permits in China, any retroactive change in policy guidelines or regulations, or an opinion that the approvals that have been obtained are inadequate, could require us to obtain additional or new permits, spend considerable resources on complying with such requirements or delay commencement of construction. Other developments, such as the enactment of more stringent environmental laws, regulations or policy guidelines or more rigorous enforcement procedures, or newly discovered conditions, could require us to incur significant capital expenditures.\nOur projects and projects of our customers are subject to an extensive governmental approval process which could delay the implementation of our business strategy.\nSelling syngas, methanol, glycol and other commodities is highly regulated in many markets around the world, as will be projects in our business verticals. We believe these projects will be supported by the governmental agencies in the areas where the projects will operate because coal-based technologies, which are less burdensome on the environment, are generally encouraged by most governments. However, the regulatory environment is often uncertain and can change quickly, often with contradictory regulations or policy guidelines being issued. In some cases, government officials have different interpretations of such regulations and policy guidelines and project approvals that are obtained could later be deemed to be inadequate. Furthermore, new policy guidelines or regulations could alter applicable requirements or require that additional levels of approval be obtained. If we or our customers and partners are unable to effectively complete the government approval process in China, Poland, Australia, and other markets in which we intend to operate, our business prospects and operating results could be seriously harmed.\nForeign laws may not afford us sufficient protections for our intellectual property, and we may not be able to obtain patent protection outside of the United States.\nCertain nations that we operate in may not grant us certain intellectual property rights that are customarily granted in more developed legal systems. Patent law reform in the United States and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive. For example, Australia has enacted the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Raising the Bar) Act, which provides higher standards for obtaining patents. These reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to patent our products in these jurisdictions. In addition, despite continuing international pressure on the Chinese government, intellectual property rights protection continues to present significant challenges to foreign investors and, increasingly, Chinese companies. Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the commercial law in our other major markets and only limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although we have taken precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiaries and in our joint venture agreements (including as to the TSEC Joint Venture to which we have transferred the exclusive right to our technology within the joint venture territory) to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringement. Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiaries. China has put in place a comprehensive system of intellectual property laws however, incidents of infringement are common, and enforcement of rights can, in practice, be difficult. If we are unable to manage our intellectual property rights, our business and operating results may be seriously harmed.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar laws in connection with our foreign operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar other corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our corporate policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees or our respective agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that United States or other corruption laws and regulations prohibit us from using.\nIn order to effectively compete in some foreign jurisdictions, we utilize local agents and seek to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. Although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance, if we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including actions taken by our agents and our strategic or local partners, even though our agents and partners are not subject to the FCPA), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations would be negatively affected by potential currency fluctuations in exchange rates with foreign countries.\nCurrency fluctuations, devaluations and exchange restrictions may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Exchange rates are influenced by political or economic developments the United States, China or elsewhere and by macroeconomic factors and speculative actions. In some countries, local currencies may not be readily converted into U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or may only be converted at government-controlled rates, and, in some countries, the transfer of hard currencies offshore has been restricted from time to time. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure.\nFluctuations in exchange rates can have a material impact on our costs of construction, our operating expenses and the realization of revenue from the sale of commodities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to offset any such fluctuations and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and will be negatively affected if foreign currencies, such as the RMB, or the Australian dollar (\u201cAUD\u201d), or the Polish Zloty (\u201cPLN\u201d) depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange control regulations in China or other countries that restrict our ability to convert into U.S. dollars.\nRisks related to our Australian Platform\nEstimating the quantity and quality of mineral resources is an inherently uncertain process.\nEstimating the quantity and quality of mineral resources is an inherently uncertain process and any reserve estimates that we may receive from AFE related to the Pentland resource or from BFR in the future are and will be estimates and may not prove to be an accurate indication of the quantity and/or grade of mineralization that AFE or BFR has identified or that they will be able to extract, process and sell.\nMineral reserve estimates are expressions of judgement based on knowledge, experience and industry practice. Mineral reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on interpretations and geological assumptions, the application of sampling techniques, estimates of commodity prices, cost assumptions, and statistical inferences which may ultimately prove to have been unreliable.\nThe inclusion of mineral reserve estimates should not be regarded as a representation that these amounts can be economically exploited, and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on mineral reserve estimates, particularly inferred resource estimates, which are highly uncertain.\nConsequently, mineral reserve estimates are often regularly revised based on actual production experience or new information and are therefore expected to change. Furthermore, should AFE or BFR encounter mineralization or formations different from those predicted by past drilling, sampling and similar examinations, their mineral reserve estimates may have to be adjusted and mining plans, processing and infrastructure may have to be altered in a way that might adversely affect their operations. Moreover, a decline in the price of commodities, increases in production costs, decreases in recovery rates or changes in applicable laws and regulations, including environment, permitting, title or tax regulations, that are adverse to AFE or BFR, may mean the volumes of mineralization that AFE or BFR can feasibly extract may be significantly lower than the original mineral reserve estimates. If it is determined that mining of certain of resources and the reserves derived from them have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in the quantity of the aggregate resources of AFE and BFR being mined or result in AFE or BFR deciding not to proceed with the project.\nMining exploration and operations are subject to a number of factors which could adversely affect AFE and BFR.\nThe current and future operations of AFE and BFR, including exploration, appraisal, development and possible production activities may be affected by a range of exploration and operating factors, including:\n\u25cf Geological conditions;\n\u25cf Limitations on activities due to seasonal or adverse weather patterns;\n\u25cf Alterations to program and budgets;\n\u25cf Unanticipated operational and technical difficulties encountered in geophysical surveys, drilling, metallurgical laboratory work and production activities;\n\u25cf Mechanical failure of operating plant and equipment, industrial and environmental accidents, acts of terrorism or political or civil unrest and other force majeure events;\n\u25cf Industrial action, disputation or disruptions;\n\u25cf Unavailability of transport or drilling equipment to allow access and geological and geophysical investigations;\n\u25cf Unavailability of suitable laboratory facilities to complete metallurgical test work investigations;\n\u25cf Failure of metallurgical testing to determine a commercially viable product;\n\u25cf Shortages or unavailability of manpower or appropriately skilled manpower;\n\u25cf Unexpected shortages or increases in the costs of consumables, spare parts, plant and equipment; and / or\n\u25cf Prevention or restriction of access by reason of inability to obtain consents or approvals.\nBoth AFE and BFR have minimal operating history which could have an adverse effect on the success of their business operations.\nPrior to the completion of the Callide acquisition, neither AFE or BFR had developed or managed a fully operational mining or processing facility and neither of them has any direct or demonstrated experience in building or operating mining or processing facilities.\nWhile their directors and management have substantial experience in the mining and resources industries, there can be no assurance that their projects will experience results similar to those achieved by other companies or projects in which their directors and management have been involved in the past. The financial condition of AFE and BFR will depend upon the commercial viability and profitability of their projects. Neither AFE or BFR can provide any assurance that it will be able to commission or sustain the successful operation of its projects or that they will achieve commercial viability.\nOur Australian operations are subject to a number of operating risks which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe future operations of AFE and BFR will be subject to operating risks that could result in decreased production which could reduce its revenues. Operational difficulties may impact production volumes, delay or increase the cost of operating for a varying length of time. Such difficulties include (but are not limited to) unexpected maintenance or technical problems; failure of key equipment; depletion of mineral resources; increased or unexpected reclamation costs; interruptions due to transportation delays; industrial and environmental accidents; industrial disputes; unexpected shortages or increases in the costs of consumables and spare parts; availability of water; availability and cost of power and other utilities; fires; adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters. Other difficulties may arise as a result of variations in mining or operating conditions from those projected from drilling, such as geotechnical issues, variations in the amount of waste material, variations in geological conditions and the actions of potential contractors engaged to operate projects including any breach of contract or other action outside the control of AFE or BFR.\nUnforeseen geological, geotechnical or operational difficulties could also cause a loss of revenue due to lower production than expected, higher operating and maintenance costs and/ or ongoing unplanned capital expenditure to meet production targets. Any such geological conditions may adversely affect the financial performance of AFE and BFR.\nA failure to obtain access, whether under a contractual arrangement or otherwise, to an adequate supply of capital equipment or consumables for use in their operations could result in delays to the commencement of operations at projects for AFE and BFR, reduced production rates and increased costs.\nAFE and BFR may consider opportunities for expansion and/or opportunities to acquire other mining and processing rights in the future. There can be no certainty that any expenditures made by them towards the search for, acquisition of or evaluation of mineral deposits or rights will result in commercial discoveries or acquisitions.\nFailure to obtain necessary licenses or permits could delay or restrict our projects being developed in Australia.\nBoth AFE and BFR are required under applicable local laws and regulations to seek governmental concessions, permits, authorizations, licenses and other approvals, including in connection with its operating, producing, exploration and development activities. We cannot predict whether they will be able to obtain all required permits or other authorizations for its current and future operations. Obtaining, retaining or renewing the necessary governmental concessions, permits, authorizations, licenses (including with respect to environment and water use) and approvals can be a complex and time-consuming process and may involve substantial costs or the imposition of unfavorable conditions. There can be considerable delay in obtaining the necessary permits and other authorizations and in certain cases the relevant government agency may be unable to issue a required permit or other authorization in a timely manner.\nThe duration and success of permit applications are contingent on many factors that are outside of the control of AFE and BFR including objections from local communities, non-government organizations or special interest groups. Failure to obtain a material license or permit in connection with a specific project would adversely impact AFE and BFR.\nMineral exploration involves significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe exploration of mineral deposits involves significant risks which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge will not fully eliminate. While the discovery of a mineral deposit may result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be required to locate and establish ore reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular site. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which include the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, quality and proximity to infrastructure; commodity prices which are highly cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in AFE or BFR not receiving an adequate, or any, return on invested capital for any exploration activities that may be undertaken in the future.\nGovernment regulation or policy could impose a significant cost on our Australian operations.\nGovernment regulations will impose significant costs on the mining and processing operations of AFE and BFR, and future regulations could increase those costs or limit their ability to operate and produce. The mining and processing industries are subject to increasingly strict regulation with respect to matters such as limitations on land use, employee health and safety, mine permitting and licensing requirements, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, air quality standards, water pollution, protection of human health, plant life and wildlife, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on groundwater quality and availability.\nThe possibility exists that new legislation and/or regulations and orders may be adopted that may materially adversely affect the mining operations of AFE and BFR, cost structure and/or their ability of to sell (or, if applicable, export) their products. New legislation or administrative regulations (or new judicial interpretations or administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations or changes in respect policy or the enactment of policy-related decisions), including proposals related energy policy or to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the industry, may also require AFE, BFR or its customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs.\nEnvironmental regulations impacting the mining industry may adversely affect AFE and BFR.\nThe operations of AFE and BFR are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate, including those directly impacting mining activities and those indirectly affecting their businesses, such as applicable environmental laws. In addition, new environmental legislation or administrative regulations relating to mining or affecting demand for mined materials, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require AFE or BFR to significantly change or curtail their operations. The high cost of compliance with environmental regulations may discourage them from expanding existing mines or developing new mines and may also cause customers to limit or even discontinue their mining operations. As a result of these factors, our Australian projects could be adversely affected by environmental regulations directly or indirectly impacting the mining industry. Any reduction in demand as a result of environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of AFE and BFR.\nFailure to obtain necessary native title or Aboriginal cultural heritage consents and approvals could delay or restrict our projects being developed in Australia.\nBoth AFE and BFR are required under applicable local laws and regulations to seek authorizations and consents from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in relation to native title (where it has not been extinguished) and Aboriginal cultural heritage, including in connection with its operating, producing, exploration and development activities. We cannot predict whether they will be able to obtain all required authorizations and consents for its current and future operations. Obtaining, retaining or renewing the necessary authorizations and consents can be a complex and time-consuming process and may involve substantial costs or the imposition of unfavorable conditions. There can be considerable delay in obtaining the necessary authorizations and consents. However, where consents and authorizations are not provided by agreement, there are fallback options available under the native title \u201cright to negotiate\u201d process and the statutory process for development of cultural heritage management plans.\nThe duration and success of authorization and consent processes are contingent on many factors that are outside of the control of AFE and BFR. Failure to obtain an authorization or consent in connection with a specific project would adversely impact AFE and BFR.\nUncertainty or weaknesses in global economic conditions could adversely impact coal pricing.\nThe world prices of coal are strongly influenced by international demand and global economic conditions. Uncertainties or weaknesses in global economic conditions could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our financial results. In addition, if another global economic downturn were to occur, we would likely see decreased demand and decreased prices with respect to our Australian projects, resulting in lower revenue levels and decreasing margins. We are not able to predict whether the global economic conditions will continue or worsen and the impact it may have on our operations and the industry in general going forward.\nTaxation of dividends paid by AFE and BFR could have a negative impact on our shareholders.\nAustralian resident companies are liable for Australian income tax on their taxable income at a corporate tax rate (which is currently 30%). The payment of Australian income tax by an Australian company generates a \u201cfranking credit\u201d which, when the company pays a dividend to shareholders, generally flows through to the company\u2019s shareholders.\nDividends, to the extent that they are paid by AFE and BFR, may potentially be franked up to 100%. The rate of franking depends on the Australian company\u2019s level of available franking credits. The level of franking may vary over time and dividends may be partially or fully franked or not franked at all.\nNon-Australian tax resident shareholders who hold shares in an Australian tax resident company may be subject to Australian dividend withholding tax on the \u2018unfranked\u2019 component of any dividends paid by the company (unless those shares are held at or through a permanent establishment in Australia). Dividend withholding tax should not apply to non-Australian tax resident shareholders to the extent that the dividend is franked.\nWhere it applies, Australian dividend withholding tax is generally imposed at the rate of 30%, but the rate may be reduced under a double tax treaty between Australia and the jurisdiction where the shareholder is resident. Under the double tax treaty between the United States of America and Australia, the dividend withholding tax rate applicable to dividends paid to US tax residents is reduced to 5% of the gross amount of the unfranked dividend provided the shareholder holds 10% or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividends (where the US tax resident holds less than 10% of the voting power in the company paying the dividends, the dividend withholding tax rate is reduced to 15%).\nRisks Related to Our Chinese Operations\nEconomic conditions in China could have an adverse impact on the performance of our joint venture partners and, as a result, our results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by economic uncertainty in China or the United States, such as may result from the current trade tariff discussions between the U.S. and China or other political tensions, which could create further financial challenges for us and make our Chinese businesses less economic and more difficult to consummate new business.\nWe may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in China.\nChina historically has been deficient in Western-style management and financial reporting concepts and practices, as well as in modern banking, computer and other control systems. We have limited influence in decision making in our Chinese joint ventures. For example, we changed from the equity method of accounting for our investment in the Yima Joint Venture to the cost method of accounting because we concluded that we are unable to exercise significant influence over the Yima Joint Venture due to, among other things, our limited participation in operating and financial policymaking processes and our limited ability to influence technological decisions.\nWe may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of employees who are qualified to assist us in application of such concepts and practices to work in China.\nAs a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. This situation can be more challenging in cost method investments where we do not experience significant influence and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nChina\u2019s anti-corruption campaign may adversely impact our Chinese partners and our Chinese joint ventures.\nThe Chinese government initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign to improve governance in China. The primary focus of this campaign was largely on state-owned enterprises (\u201cSOE\u201d). Certain of our joint ventures are majority owned by an SOE. If one or more of the senior executives of our SOE joint venture partner or related entities are questioned or come under investigation, this could limit our participation in the on-going operations of the facilities and could adversely affect our realization of our investment in such joint ventures and facilities. This would materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty making distributions and repatriating earnings from our Chinese operations.\nUnder Chinese regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. The foreign invested company may not distribute profits until the losses of the previous fiscal years have been made up. Additionally, the foreign invested company shall make allocations of after-tax profits to a reserve fund and a bonus and welfare fund for their employees. In the case of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture, in addition to the reserve fund and the bonus and welfare fund, the company shall also make allocations to a venture expansion fund. In the case of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, the amount to be contributed to the reserve fund shall be no less than 10% of the after-tax profits unless the aggregate amount reaches 50% of the registered capital of the company, at which time the company may stop making allocations to the reserve fund. The amount to be contributed to other funds of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise or any of the above funds of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture may be determined by the board of the company in accordance with the applicable Chinese laws. Any amounts to be contributed to such funds shall be set aside prior to distribution of after-tax profit. If we are unable to make distributions and repatriate earnings from our Chinese operations, it could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nIncreased development of shale gas in China could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAccording to a 2014 study published by the EIA, China has the world\u2019s largest technically recoverable shale gas reserve resource, representing approximately 9.2% of the world\u2019s total recoverable shale gas resources. However, given the variation across the world\u2019s shale formations in both geology and above-the-ground conditions, the extent to which global technically recoverable shale resources will prove to be economically recoverable is not yet clear. The market effect of shale resources outside the United States will depend on the associated production costs, volumes, and market prices. For example, a potential shale well that costs twice as much and produces half the output of a typical U.S. well would not likely be developed. An increase in the development of shale gas would be a competitive alternative to syngas which is produced by our technology and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation if successful.\nOur operations in China may be adversely affected by evolving economic, political and social conditions.\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally. Such risks include the adverse effects on operations from war, international terrorism, civil disturbances, political instability, governmental activities and deprivation of contract and property rights. In particular, since 1978, the Chinese government has been reforming its economic and political systems, and we expect this to continue. Although we believe that these reforms have had a positive effect on the economic development of China and have improved our ability to do business in China, we cannot assure you that these reforms will continue or that the Chinese government will not take actions that impair our operations or assets in China. In addition, periods of international unrest may impede our ability to do business in other countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, changes in China\u2019s economic or political situations could impact the exchange rate of the Chinese Renminbi yuan, which could materially impact our financial positions and our results of operations in China.\nChinese regulations of loans and direct investment by offshore entities to Chinese entities may delay or prevent us from utilizing proceeds of funds to make loans or additional capital contributions to our operations in China, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nWe may make loans or additional capital contributions to our operations in China. Any loans to our Chinese operations are subject to Chinese regulations and approvals. Such loans by us cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local counterpart. We may also decide to finance our Chinese operations by means of capital contributions. This capital contribution must be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital contributions by us to our Chinese operations or any of their subsidiaries. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to capitalize our Chinese operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely and materially affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.\nThe Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nWe face risks related to natural disasters and health epidemics in China, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by natural disasters or the outbreak of health epidemics in China. For example, in May 2008, Sichuan Province suffered a strong earthquake measuring approximately 8.0 on the Richter scale that caused widespread damage and casualties. In addition, in the last decade, China has suffered health epidemics related to the outbreak of avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Any future natural disasters or health epidemics in China could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct substantially all of our current business through our operating subsidiaries in China. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to Chinese laws and regulations including those applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, decided legal cases have little precedential value in China. In 1979, the Chinese government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation since 1979 has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China. However, Chinese laws and regulations change frequently, and the interpretation of laws and regulations is not always uniform, and enforcement thereof can involve uncertainties. For instance, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we are entitled to by law or contract. However, since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting statutory and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative court proceedings and the level of law enforcement that we would receive in more developed legal systems. Such uncertainties, including the potential inability to enforce our contracts, could limit legal protections available to you and us and could affect our business and operations. In addition, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Accordingly, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the Chinese legal system, particularly with regard to the industries in which we operate, including the promulgation of new laws. This may include changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. These uncertainties could limit the availability of law enforcement, including our ability to enforce our agreements with Chinese government entities and other foreign investors.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe are at risk of being de-listed from The NASDAQ Stock Market if we do not regain compliance with the minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity for continued listing required by NASDAQ rules and certain other deficiencies.\nOn May 16, 2019, SES received a notice of noncompliance (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that the Company was not compliant with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market because the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity, as reported in SES\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2019, was below the required minimum of $2.5 million. Based on materials provided to Nasdaq by SES, the Staff granted SES an extension through November 12, 2019 to complete the Merger.\nOn November 13, 2019, SES received notification from the Staff that it did not meet the terms of the previously granted extension and, as a result, the Staff has determined that that the securities of SES would be subject to delisting unless SES timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d).\nAdditionally, on October 17, 2019, the Staff notified SES that since it failed to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019, it no longer complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). SES was given until December 16, 2019, to submit a plan of compliance for consideration by the Staff. However, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Staff has informed SES that it can no longer consider the Company\u2019s plan, and, as a result, the failure to file the Form 10-K serves as an additional and separate basis for delisting. On November 21, 2019, SES received an additional delinquency notification letter from the Staff due to SES\u2019s continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of the Company\u2019s failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\nSES has requested a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request automatically stayed any suspension/delisting action through December 5, 2019. On December 13, 2019, we received notification from the Panel that it had determined to extend the stay of suspension through the completion of the hearings process, which will take place on December 19, 2019. At the hearing, the Company will request the stay be extended through the closing of the previously announced Merger with AFE. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant a further extension to enable the Company to demonstrate compliance that it has regained compliance with all applicable requirements.\nOur historic stock price has been volatile and the future market price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe public market for our common stock has historically been very volatile. Any future market price for our shares is likely to continue to be very volatile. This price volatility may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell shares when they want at prices that they find attractive. We do not know of any one particular factor that has caused volatility in our stock price. However, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. Broad market factors and the investing public\u2019s negative perception of our business may reduce our stock price, regardless of our operating performance.\nOur common stock is thinly traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, the trading volume has historically been low. We cannot assure investors that trading volume will increase or the volatility of the trading price of our common stock will decrease. We cannot assure investors that a more active trading market will develop even if we issue more equity in the future.\nThe market valuation of our business may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control and the value of the investment of our stockholders may fluctuate correspondingly.\nThe market valuation of clean energy companies, such as us, frequently fluctuate due to factors unrelated to the past or present operating performance of such companies. Our market valuation may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf Changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes, particularly among securities of energy companies;\n\u25cf Changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new technologies, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf Variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in coal, oil, natural gas, methanol and ammonia prices;\n\u25cf Loss of a major customer of failure to complete significant commercial contracts;\n\u25cf Loss of a relationship with a partner; and\n\u25cf Additions or departures of key personnel.\nAs a result, the value of your investment in us may fluctuate.\nInvestors should not look to dividends as a source of income.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any economic return will initially be derived, if at all, from appreciation in the fair market value of our stock, and not as a result of dividend payments.", "PERMNO": 92453, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "SYNE"}
