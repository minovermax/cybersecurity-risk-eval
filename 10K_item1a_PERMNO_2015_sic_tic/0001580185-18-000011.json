{"cik": "1580185", "company": "J.G. Wentworth Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors generally have been separated into seven groups: (1) risks related to our overall business operations; (2) risks related to our legal and regulatory environment; (3) risks related to our financial position; (4) risks related to our Structured Settlements segment; (5) risks related to our Home Lending segment; (6) risks related to emergence from bankruptcy; and (7) risks related to ownership of our common stock. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related To Our Overall Business Operations\nFailure to execute on our business strategy could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have recently experienced losses in our Structured Settlements segment. Our future viability is dependent on management's ability to execute our business strategy to return this segment to profitability as well as increase results in the Home Lending segment.\nThe following are some of the elements of our business strategy:\n\u2022\nimplementing enhanced customer retention and loyalty strategies to improve conversion rates of leads into completed transactions and improve customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nrevising our direct response marketing programs to be more digital focused to increase efficiency at lower spend levels;\n\u2022\neffectively reorganizing our production activities;\n\u2022\nincreasing the volume of transactions completed; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing to access securitization or other financing markets on favorable terms.\nIf a return to profitability and cash flow generation do not occur within the time frame that we anticipate, or if we continue to incur losses in our Structured Settlements segment without significantly increasing Home Lending revenues and cash flows to offset these losses, we may not be able to renew our warehouse lines of credit and may not have sufficient working capital to fund our business, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in the industries in which we operate is intense and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in the industries in which we operate is intense. In the structured settlement and annuity payments purchasing industry, we compete with other purchasers of those payment streams. It is possible that some competitors may have a lower cost of funds or access to funding sources that may not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of asset purchases and establish relationships with our customers. Furthermore, competition for purchases of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. We also face competition from insurance companies that have recently begun offering payees the option to accelerate payments (at a stated discount rate) from structured settlements that the specific insurance company has issued to that payee.\nMany of our competitors with respect to our payment solutions business are larger banks and card providers with diversified consumer bases and strong name recognition. In personal lending, we compete with other lead aggregators, including online intermediaries that operate network-type arrangements and also face competition from lenders that source consumer loan originations directly through their owned and operated websites, by phone or by direct mail.\nIn our Home Lending segment, our competitors include banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies. We compete directly with many large financial institutions, regional or local banking institutions, and direct lending or retail lending mortgage loan originators. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and access to capital, as well as lower origination and operating costs. To compete effectively, we strive to have a high level of operational, technological, and managerial expertise, as well as access to capital at a competitive cost.\nThe competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are heavily dependent on direct response marketing and if we are unable to reach prospective customers and borrowers in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use direct response marketing to generate the inbound communications from prospective customers that are the basis of our payment purchasing, home lending, referral and payment solutions program management activities. As a result, we have spent considerable money and resources on advertising to reach prospective customers. We have recently scaled back the spending in our direct response marketing program and have revised the program to more efficiently reach prospective customers while operating at a lower spend level. Our reorganized marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective and if we are unable to reach prospective customers in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we are heavily dependent on television and digital advertising and a change in television viewing habits or Internet usage patterns could adversely impact our business. For example, the use of digital video recorders that allow viewers to skip commercials reduces the efficacy of our television marketing. There has also been a recent proliferation of new marketing platforms, including cellphones, personal computers and tablets, as well as an increasing use of social media. If we are unable to adapt to these new marketing platforms, this may reduce the success and/or cost-effectiveness of our marketing efforts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, an event that reduces or eliminates our ability to reach potential customers or interrupts our telephone system could substantially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team, and if we lose any member of that team or are unable to attract additional qualified talent to that team, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends to a considerable degree on the skills, experience and effort of our senior management team. If we lose the services of any member of our senior management team, it could have an adverse effect on our business, especially if we are unable to attract a qualified replacement. We do not carry \"key man\" insurance for any of the members of our senior management team. Competition to hire personnel possessing the skills and experience we require is intense, and we may not successfully attract qualified personnel to fill vacancies in our management team or to expand our management team, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have access to personally identifiable confidential information of current and prospective customers and the improper use of or failure to protect that information could adversely affect our business and reputation. Furthermore, any significant\nsecurity breach of our software applications or technology that contains personally identifiable confidential information of current customers could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur business often requires that we handle personally identifiable confidential information, the use and disclosure of which is significantly restricted under federal and state privacy laws. As part of our normal operations, we rely on secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential customer information through computer software systems and networks. Our information technology infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to security breaches, and a party able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate private customer information. We maintain and rely on external and internal cybersecurity solutions as part of our internal controls that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to our customers' confidential data is prevented or detected in a timely manner. However, although we have not had any occurrences of a breach of our cybersecurity solutions, these internal controls may not continue to prevent unauthorized access to our software systems and networks.\nIn addition, our employees, vendors and business partners may have access to such confidential information. It is not always possible to deter misconduct by our employees, vendors and business partners, and the precautions we take to prevent disclosure of confidential information by our employees, vendors and business partners may not be effective in all cases. If our employees, vendors or business partners improperly use or disclose such confidential information, we could be subject to legal proceedings or regulatory sanctions.\nLoss or misappropriation of confidential information of our customers may result in a loss of confidence in our transactions, may greatly harm our reputation, may adversely affect our ability to maintain current or potential customer relationships, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. We maintain insurance coverage for certain losses associated with a cybersecurity breach, but we cannot guarantee that our insurance policies will fully protect us against all such losses and liabilities.\nIf we are unable to upgrade and/or integrate our operational and financial information systems or expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur diversification has placed, and will continue to place, increased demands on our information systems and other resources and further expansion of our operations will require substantial financial resources. To compete effectively in light of our diversification, we will need to continue to upgrade and integrate our information systems and expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce. Any failure to upgrade and integrate our operational and financial information systems, or to expand, train, manage or motivate our workforce, may adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on uninterrupted computer access and the reliable operation of our information technology systems; any prolonged delays due to data interruptions, caused by third-party service providers or otherwise, or revocation of our software licenses could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and cause our customers to seek alternative service providers.\nMany aspects of our business are dependent upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage data and to maintain and upgrade our data processing capabilities. Our success is dependent on high-quality and uninterrupted access to our computer systems, requiring us to protect our computer equipment, software and the information stored on servers against damage by fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events. Interruption of data processing capabilities for any extended length of time, loss of stored data, programming errors or other technological problems could impair our ability to provide certain products. Some of our proprietary computer systems and back-up systems are deployed, operated, monitored and supported by third parties whom we do not control. We also rely on third-party service providers for software development and system support. A system failure, if prolonged, could result in reduced revenues, loss of customers and damage to our reputation, any of which could cause our business to materially suffer. In addition, due to the highly automated environment in which we operate our computer systems, any undetected error in the operation of our business processes or computer software may cause us to lose revenues or subject us to liabilities for third party claims. While we carry property and business interruption insurance to cover operations, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nWe depend on a number of third parties for the successful and timely execution of our business strategy and the failure of any of those parties to meet certain deadlines could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue.\nOur ability to operate our business depends on a number of third parties, including rating agencies, notaries, outside counsel, insurance companies, investment banks, the court system, servicers, sub-servicers, collateral custodians and entities that participate in the capital markets to buy the related debt. We do not control these third parties and a failure to perform according to our requirements or acts of fraud by such parties could materially impact our business.\nFor example, there have in the past and may be in the future deficiencies in court orders obtained on our behalf by third parties that result in those court orders being invalid, including as a result of failures to perform according to our requirements and acts of gross negligence or fraud, in which case we would need to take additional steps to attempt to cure the deficiencies. We may or may not be successful in curing these deficiencies and, if successful, there may nonetheless be a delay in our receipt of payment streams pursuant to the court orders and, if unsuccessful, we may have to repurchase such payment streams from our securitization\nfacilities. Any delay in the receipt of, or the invalidation of, a significant number of court orders or any delay in the closing of a securitization would significantly and adversely affect our earnings.\nWith respect to third parties engaged to perform activities required by servicing criteria, we are responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the applicable vendor and are required to have procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the third party's activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor, including, but not limited to, monitoring compliance with our predetermined policies and procedures and monitoring the status of payment processing operations. In the event that a vendor's activities do not comply with the servicing criteria, it could negatively impact our compliance with our servicing agreements.\nIf our current third-party partners were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure services from alternative vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In our Home Lending segment, we currently use one third party for sub-servicing, and changing to another third party would take considerable time and effort. We may incur significant costs to resolve any disruptions in service and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, in April 2012, the CFPB issued CFPB Bulletin 2012-03 which states that supervised banks and non-banks could be held liable for actions of their service providers. This bulletin was reissued substantially unchanged as Bulletin 2016-02 on October 31, 2016. As a result of Bulletin 2016-02, we could be exposed to liability, CFPB enforcement actions or other administrative penalties in certain of our business lines if the third parties with whom we do business violate consumer protection laws. In particular, as a result of our use of a sub-servicer in our Home Lending segment, regulators could conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our sub-servicer or that our sub-servicer has not performed appropriately, and as a result we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUse of social media to disseminate negative commentary may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative commentary regarding us or our brands may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Consumers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. In addition, social media platforms provide users with access to such a broad audience that collective action, such as boycotts, can be more easily organized. If such actions were organized against us, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, our brands maintain Facebook and Twitter accounts. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nUnfavorable press reports about us or the industries in which we operate may make prospective customers less willing to use us for their financial needs, lead to increased regulation or make third party vendors less willing to work with us.\nThe structured settlement, annuity and lottery purchasing and mortgage lending industries are periodically the subject of negative press reports from the media and consumer advocacy groups. The structured settlement, annuity and lottery purchasing industry is relatively new and is susceptible to confusion about the role of purchasers of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams and other alternative financial assets.\nWe depend upon direct response marketing and our reputation to attract prospective customers and maintain existing customers. A sustained campaign of negative press reports about us or the industries in which we participate could adversely affect the public's perception of us and these industries as a whole, as well as the willingness of prospective customers to use us for their financial needs. In addition, such unfavorable press reports can gain the attention of law makers and lead to additional regulation or reform in the industries in which we operate. For example, in August 2015, the Washington Post and several other media outlets published stories about the structured settlement payment purchasing industry, certain industry practices and the activities of one industry participant in the Maryland area. These articles gained national attention as well as the attention of members of Congress and state legislatures. Third party vendors also could potentially terminate their relationships with the Company due to perceived negative connotations resulting from unfavorable press reports.\nIf people are reluctant to sell structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams and other assets to us or to originate mortgages with us due to negative public perception, if our compliance costs are increased due to increased regulation\nof the industries in which we operate, or if third party vendors terminate their relationship with us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nOur business may suffer if our trademarks, service marks or domain names are infringed.\nWe rely on trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our brands. Many of these trademarks, service marks and domain names have been a key part of establishing our business. We believe these trademarks, service marks and domain names have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our rights or the use by others of features based upon, or otherwise similar to, ours. In addition, although we believe we have the right to use our trademarks, service marks and domain names, we cannot guarantee that our trademarks, service marks and domain names do not or will not violate the proprietary rights of others, that our trademarks, service marks and domain names will be upheld if challenged, or that we will not be prevented from using our trademarks, service marks and domain names, any of which occurrences could materially harm our business.\nWe operate primarily at two main locations, and any disruption at these facilities could harm our business.\nOur principal executive offices are located in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, and our Structured Settlements segment, including customer and technical support and management and administrative functions, operates principally out of that location. The majority of our Home Lending segment's underwriting, closing, funding, and corporate functions are managed centrally at its headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia. We take precautions to safeguard our facilities, including acquiring insurance, employing back-up generators, adopting health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data. Notwithstanding these precautions, any disruptions to our operations at these facilities, including from power outage, systems failure, vandalism, terrorism or a natural or other disaster, such as severe weather, hurricane, fire or flood, could significantly impair our operations for a substantial period of time, result in the loss of key information and cause us to incur additional expenses. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. In addition, most of our employees live in the areas surrounding our principal offices, and any natural or other disaster in those areas will likely also affect our employees, causing them to be unable to occupy our facilities, work remotely or communicate with or travel to other locations. Such damage to our facilities and operations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe success and growth of our business will depend upon our ability to adapt to and implement technological changes.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to interface effectively with our customers and other third parties and to process transactions efficiently. The asset purchase and loan and mortgage origination processes are becoming more dependent upon technological advancement, such as the ability to process applications over the Internet, interface with customers and other third parties through electronic means and underwrite loan applications using specialized software. Implementing new technology and maintaining the efficiency of the current technology used in our operations may require significant capital expenditures. As these requirements increase in the future, we will have to develop these technological capabilities fully to remain competitive or our business will be significantly harmed.\nRisks Related To Our Legal And Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations, and we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations directly impact our business and require constant compliance, monitoring and internal and external audits. In the event that we fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, the CFPB and applicable federal and state agencies may have the power to levy fines or file suits against us or compel settlements with monetary penalties and operational requirements. In addition, a material failure to comply with any state laws or regulations could result in the loss or suspension of our licenses in the applicable jurisdictions where such violations occur. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes could result in the enforcement of stricter compliance measures or adoption of additional measures on us or on the third parties, with whom we conduct our business, could restrict our ability to originate, finance, acquire or securitize financial assets or could lead to significantly increased compliance costs and operating expenses. For example, the implementation of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule (the \"TRID\"), which became effective on October 3, 2015, required additional technological changes and additional implementation costs for us as a mortgage loan originator and servicer. Any future changes in laws or regulations which increase our compliance costs, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business as currently conducted, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDodd-Frank continues to have the potential to increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs and place restrictions on certain originations and servicing operations.\nDodd-Frank represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry in the United States. Dodd-Frank includes, among other things: (i) the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks posed by financial firms, activities and practices, and to improve cooperation among federal agencies; (ii) the creation of the CFPB, which is authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to consumer financial products; (iii) the establishment of strengthened capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies; (iv) enhanced regulation of financial markets, including the derivatives and securitization markets; and (v) amendments to the TILA aimed at improving consumer protections with respect to asset backed securities and mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and prepayment considerations.\nThe CFPB has adopted, and may continue to adopt, rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to our lines of business. Since 2011, under former Director Richard Cordray\u2019s leadership, the CFPB implemented certain provisions of Dodd-Frank relating to mortgage originations and mortgage servicing. In 2014, a risk retention requirement was adopted under Dodd-Frank that requires sponsors of securitizations to retain at least 5% of the credit risk relating to the assets that underlie asset backed securities sold through a securitization, including MBSs and the securitizations of the payment streams that we purchase, absent certain exemptions, including a qualified residential mortgage (\"QRM\") exemption. The risk retention requirement became effective on December 24, 2016 and applies to securitizations created after the effective date. The risk retention requirement may result in higher costs of certain of our securitizations and origination operations and could impose on us additional compliance requirements to meet servicing and origination criteria for QRMs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the mortgages that we originate in our Home Lending segment will generally qualify for the QRM exemption and securitizations of these loans will not be subject to the risk retention requirement, securitizations of payment streams purchased in our Structured Settlements segment will be subject to the risk retention requirement, which will decrease the amount that cash that we receive in connection with each such securitization. In addition, on October 5, 2016, the CFPB finalized new Regulation E requirements, implementing the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, for prepaid accounts. The new Regulation E rules require financial institutions to limit consumers\u2019 losses when funds are stolen or cards are lost, investigate and resolve errors, and increase the amount of account information that must be provided to consumers. The rules also include new \"Know Before You Owe\" disclosures that are designed to give consumers clear, upfront information about fees and other costs. Also on October 5, 2016, the CFPB finalized further requirements for prepaid accounts under Regulation Z, implementing the TILA. Pursuant to the new Regulation Z rules, issuers of prepaid accounts must provide protections similar to those for credit cards if they allow consumers to use credit to make purchases in excess of the amount prepaid.\nIn addition, on January 25, 2018, the CFPB issued a final rule postponing the effective date of the revised final rule to April 1, 2019 from the previous effective date of April 1, 2018.\nThe ongoing implementation of Dodd-Frank, including the implementation of the securitization, origination and servicing rules by the CFPB, the implementation of the integrated disclosures under the TRID, and the CFPB's continuing examination of our structured settlement and annuity payment purchasing business, will likely increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs and may place restrictions on our originations, servicing and financing operations, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailures in our compliance systems could subject us to significant legal and regulatory costs. Furthermore, if our risk management methods are not effective, our business, reputation and financial results may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance, audit, risk and reporting systems and procedures. However, any compliance and risk management system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These limitations include the reality that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Thus, our policies and procedures may not be fully effective, and we may not always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed. As a result, we may be subject to significant legal and regulatory costs in the event that our systems fail to prevent violations of laws or regulations, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to liability for potential violations of predatory lending and ability to repay laws in our Home Lending segment.\nVarious federal, state and local laws have been enacted that are designed to discourage predatory lending practices. The federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (\"HOEPA\") prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in residential mortgage loans that have mortgage rates or origination costs in excess of prescribed levels and requires that borrowers be given\ncertain disclosures prior to origination. Some states have enacted, or may enact, similar laws or regulations, which in some cases impose restrictions and requirements greater than those in HOEPA. Additionally, the CFPB has implemented a rule that requires lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay a mortgage loan. This rule defines certain types of loans as \"qualified mortgages\" and creates a presumption that qualified mortgages satisfy the ability to repay standard. Non-qualified mortgages do not receive a presumption of a consumer's ability to repay. In addition, under the anti-predatory lending laws of some states, the origination of certain residential mortgage loans, including loans that are not classified as \"high-cost\" loans under applicable law, must satisfy a net tangible benefits test with respect to the related borrower. This test may be highly subjective and open to interpretation. As a result, a court may determine that a residential mortgage loan does not meet the test even if the related originator reasonably believed that the test was satisfied. If any of our production loans are found to have been originated in violation of predatory, ability to repay or abusive lending laws, we could incur penalties, fines and other expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse judicial developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse judicial developments have occasionally occurred and could occur in the future in the industries in which we do business. In the structured settlement payment purchasing industry, adverse judicial developments have occurred with regard to anti-assignment concerns and issues associated with non-disclosure of material facts and associated misconduct. Most of the settlement agreements that give rise to the structured settlement receivables that we purchase contain anti-assignment provisions that purport to prohibit assignments or encumbrances of structured settlement payments due under the agreement. If anti-assignment provisions are included in an agreement, a claimant or a payor could attempt to invoke the anti-assignment provision to invalidate a claimant's transfer of structured settlement payments to the purchaser, or to force the purchaser to pay damages. In addition, under certain circumstances, interested parties other than the related claimant or payor could challenge, and potentially invalidate, an assignment of structured settlement payments made in violation of an anti-assignment provision. Whether the presence of an anti-assignment provision in a settlement agreement can be used to invalidate a prior transfer depends on various aspects of state and federal law, including case law and the form of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted in the applicable state. Any adverse judicial developments calling into doubt laws and regulations related to structured settlements, annuities, lotteries or mortgage originations, financings or foreclosures could materially and adversely affect our investments in such assets and our financing.\nState or federal governmental examinations, legal proceedings, enforcement actions or tax rulings and related costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are routinely involved in regulatory reviews and legal proceedings concerning matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, both federal and state government agencies have increased civil and criminal enforcement efforts relating to consumer protection in the specialty finance industry. This heightened enforcement activity increases our potential exposure to damaging lawsuits, investigations and other enforcement actions. An adverse result in regulatory actions or examinations or private lawsuits may adversely affect our financial results. Defense of any lawsuit, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of our senior management that would otherwise be spent on other aspects of our business and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of, or adverse results in, lawsuits may also result in significant payments and modifications to our operations.\nIn addition, a number of participants in our industries have been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and regulatory actions by state regulators and other industry participants have been the subject of actions by state Attorneys General. Regulatory investigations, both state and federal, can be either formal or informal. The costs of responding to the investigations can be substantial. Furthermore, government-mandated changes to disclosure requirements and business practices could lead to higher costs and additional administrative burdens, in particular regarding record retention and informational obligations.\nWe could also suffer monetary losses or restrictions on our operations from interpretations of state laws in regulatory proceedings or lawsuits, even if we are not a party. For example, the federal and state agencies overseeing certain aspects of the mortgage market have entered into settlements and enforcement consent orders with other mortgage servicers regarding foreclosure practices that primarily relate to mortgage loans originated during the credit crisis. Although we are not a party to any of these settlements and enforcement consent orders and lack the legacy loans that gave rise to these settlements and enforcement consent orders, the practices set forth in those settlements and consent orders have been adopted by the industry as a whole and are also required by the CFPB's mortgage servicing rule, forcing us to comply with them in order to follow standard industry practices and regulatory requirements. While we have made and continue to make changes to our operating policies and procedures in light of these settlements and consent orders, further changes could be required.\nWe have been the subject of Civil Investigative Demands from the CFPB with respect to our Structured Settlements segment and could be subject in the future to enforcement actions by the CFPB.\nDodd-Frank grants regulatory powers to the CFPB and gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders and civil monetary penalties. Also, where a company has violated Title X of Dodd-Frank or CFPB regulations under Title X, Dodd-Frank empowers state Attorneys General and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties).\nWe have, since March 2014, been served with several CIDs from the CFPB relating to our structured settlement and annuity payment purchasing activities. The CIDs have requested various information and documents, including oral testimony, for the purpose of determining our compliance with federal consumer financial laws, and we have provided documents and oral testimony relating to requests in these CIDs. On February 1, 2018, the CFPB issued a letter to JGW LLC noting that it had completed its review as to JGW LLC and that the Office of Enforcement was not intending to recommend that the CFPB take any enforcement action. Thus, JGW LLC considers this matter closed.\nWhile we believe that the our practices are fully compliant with applicable law, if the CFPB or one or more state officials believe we have violated the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnlike banks and similar financial institutions with which we compete in our Home Lending segment, we are subject to state licensing and operational requirements that result in substantial compliance costs.\nBecause we are not a depository institution, we do not benefit from exemptions to state mortgage banking, loan servicing or debt collection licensing and some regulatory requirements that are generally given to depository institutions under state law. Home Lending must comply with state licensing requirements and varying compliance requirements in each jurisdiction in which it actively does business, which consists of 45 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2017. Future regulatory changes may increase our costs through stricter licensing or disclosure laws or increased fees, or may impose conditions to licensing that we are unable to meet. In addition, we are subject to periodic examinations by state regulators, which can result in refunds to borrowers of certain fees collected by us, and we may be required to pay substantial penalties imposed by state regulators due to compliance errors. Future state legislation and changes in existing regulation may significantly increase our compliance costs or reduce the amount of ancillary fees, including late fees that we may charge to borrowers. This could make our Home Lending business cost-prohibitive in the affected state or states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Home Lending business would be adversely affected if we lose our licenses or if we are unable to obtain licenses in new markets.\nOur mortgage operations are subject to licensing under various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. In most states in which we operate, a regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to mortgage loan servicing companies and mortgage loan origination companies such as us. These rules and regulations generally provide for licensing as a mortgage servicing company, mortgage origination company or third party debt default specialist, requirements as to the form and content of contracts and other documentation, licensing of our employees and employee hiring background checks, licensing of independent contractors with which we contract, restrictions on collection practices, disclosure and record-keeping requirements and enforcement of borrowers' rights. In certain states, we are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities. Some states in which we operate require special licensing or provide extensive regulation of our business.\nWe believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. We may not, however, be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits in the future. In addition, the states that currently do not provide extensive regulation of our business may later choose to do so, and if such states so act, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all requisite licenses and permits. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing agreements and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, the adoption of additional, or the revision of existing, rules and regulations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in existing state laws governing the transfer of structured settlement or lottery payments or in the interpretation thereof may adversely impact our Structured Settlements segment.\nThe structured settlement and lottery payments secondary markets are highly regulated and require court approval for each sale under applicable state transfer statutes. These transfer statutes, as well as states' uniform commercial codes, insurance laws and rules of civil procedure, help ensure the validity, enforceability and tax characteristics of the structured settlement payments and lottery receivables purchasing transactions in which we engage. States may amend their transfer statutes, uniform commercial\ncodes and rules of civil procedure in a manner that inhibits our ability to conduct business, including by means of retroactive laws, which would adversely impact our business. In addition, courts may interpret transfer statutes in a manner that inhibits our ability to conduct business. Failing to comply with the terms of a transfer statute when purchasing payments could potentially result in forfeiture of both the right to receive the payments and any unrecovered portion of the purchase price we paid for the payments, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain changes in current tax law could have a material adverse effect on our Structured Settlements segment, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe use of structured settlements is largely the result of their favorable federal income tax treatment. Under current tax law, claimants receiving installment payments as compensation for a personal injury are exempt from all federal income taxation on such payments, provided certain conditions are met. Congress has previously considered and may revisit legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax deferred nature of structured settlements and annuity products. If the tax treatment for structured settlements was changed adversely by a statutory change or a change in interpretation, the dollar volume of structured settlements issued could be reduced significantly, which would, in turn, reduce the addressable market of our structured settlement payments purchasing business. In addition, if there were a change in the Code or a change in interpretation that would result in adverse tax consequences for the assignment or transfer of structured settlement payments, such change could also reduce the market of our structured settlements and annuity payments purchasing business. Such a reduction of that market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be assessed excise taxes that result from IRS audits of our compliance with Section 5891 of the Code which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nSection 5891 of the Code, as set forth in the Tax Relief Act, levies an excise tax upon those people or entities that acquire structured settlement payments from a seller on or after February 22, 2002, unless certain conditions are satisfied. Such tax equals 40% of the discount obtained by the purchaser of the structured settlement payments. However, no such tax is levied if the transfer of such structured settlement payments is approved in a qualified court order. A qualified court order under the Tax Relief Act means a final order, judgment or decree that finds that the transfer does not contravene any federal or state law or the order of any court or administrative authority and is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee's dependents. The order must be issued under the authority of an applicable state statute of the state in which the seller is domiciled, or, if there is no such statute, under the authority of an applicable state statute of the state in which the payment obligor or annuity provider has its principal place of business, and issued by a court of such state, or by the responsible administrative authority (if any) that has exclusive jurisdiction over the underlying action or proceeding. If we fail to satisfy these conditions, we could be assessed excise taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Structured Settlements segment could be adversely affected if the Bankruptcy Code is changed or interpreted in a manner that affects our rights to scheduled payments with respect to a payment stream we have purchased.\nIf a holder of a structured settlement, annuity or lottery payment stream were to become a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, a court could hold that the scheduled payments transferred by the holder under the applicable purchase agreement do not constitute property of the estate of the claimant under the Bankruptcy Code. If, however, a trustee in bankruptcy or other receiver were to assert a contrary position, such as by requiring us, or any securitization vehicle, to establish our right to those payments under federal bankruptcy law or by persuading courts to recharacterize the transaction as secured loans, such result could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the rights to receive the scheduled payments are deemed to be property of the bankruptcy estate of the claimant, the trustee may be able to avoid assignment of the receivable to us.\nFurthermore, a general creditor or representative of the creditors, such as a trustee in bankruptcy, of a special purpose vehicle to which an insurance company assigns its obligations to make payments under a structured settlement, annuity or lottery payment stream could make the argument that the payments due from the annuity provider are the property of the estate of such special purpose vehicle (as the named owner thereof). To the extent that a court accepted this argument, the resulting delays or reductions in payments on our receivables could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlso, many of our financing facilities are structured using \"bankruptcy remote\" special purpose entities to which structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams are sold in connection with such financing facilities. Under current case law, courts generally uphold such structures, the separateness of such entities and the sales of such assets if certain factors are met. If, however, a bankruptcy court were to find that such factors did not exist in the financing facilities or current case law was to change, there would be a risk that defaults would occur under the financing facilities. Moreover, certain subsidiaries may be consolidated upon a bankruptcy of one of our subsidiaries or the sales may not be upheld as true sales by a reviewing court. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur purchases of certain financial assets may be viewed as consumer lending, which could subject us to adverse regulatory limitations and litigation.\nFrom time to time, we have been named as defendant in suits involving attempts to recharacterize the purchase of court-ordered or non-court-ordered structured settlement payments or other assets as loan transactions. If a transaction is characterized as a loan rather than a sale, then various consumer lending laws apply, such as usury statutes, consumer credit statutes or truth-in-lending statutes. If a court finds any of our structured settlement, annuity or lottery purchase transactions are subject to consumer lending laws, we may not have complied in all respects with the requirements of the applicable statutes with respect to those transactions. The failure to comply could result in remedies including the rescission of the agreement under which we purchased the right to the stream of periodic payments and the repayment of amounts we received under that agreement.\nOur foreclosure proceedings in certain states may be delayed due to inquiries by certain state Attorneys General, court administrators and state and federal government agencies, the outcome of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAllegations of irregularities in foreclosure processes, including so-called \"robo-signing\" by mortgage loan servicers, have gained the attention of the Department of Justice, regulatory agencies, state Attorneys General and the media, among other parties. Certain state Attorneys General, court administrators and government agencies, as well as representatives of the federal government, have issued letters of inquiry to mortgage servicers requesting written responses to questions regarding policies and procedures, especially with respect to notarization and affidavit procedures. Even though we have not received any letters of inquiry and we do not have the legacy loans that have been examined for irregularities in the foreclosure process, our operations may be affected by regulatory actions or court decisions that are taken in connection with these inquiries. In addition to these inquiries, several state Attorneys General have requested that certain mortgage servicers suspend foreclosure proceedings pending internal review to ensure compliance with applicable law.\nThe current legislative and regulatory climate could lead borrowers to contest foreclosures that they would not otherwise have contested, and we may incur increased litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. Delays in foreclosure proceedings could also require us to make additional servicing advances by drawing on our financing facilities, delay the recovery of advances, or result in compensatory fees being imposed against us by a GSE or the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the \"FHFA\") for delaying the foreclosure process, all or any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased regulation of lead generation could adversely affect our personal loan business.\nOn July 4, 2017, Blue Global LLC, a lead generator for payday and other short-term small loans, installment loans, and auto loans was fined $104 million by the FTC. In addition, on September 19, 2017, the CFPB fined lead generator Zero Parallel $350,000 for steering consumers to lenders that were unlicensed or otherwise offered unlawful loans. Our practices do not resemble the practices engaged in by Blue Global or Zero Parallel. However, the activities of bad actors in the lead generation industry have spurred intensified regulatory scrutiny and may result in increased regulation. For example, if enacted, proposed California Senate Bill 297 would require lead generators to register with the state; comply with legal requirements for the privacy and security of personal information; and refrain engaging in false, misleading or deceptive business or advertising practices.\nIn addition, the CFPB\u2019s Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans Payday Loan Rule, which will go into effect in August 2019, could have an indirect impact on our personal loan business. While we introduce consumer borrowers to lenders and do not engage in any lending, the new rule significantly increases the complexity and costs of making high-cost loans that have a term of less than 45 days, which could affect loan volume.\nRisks Related To Our Financial Position\nWe have indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and ability to operate or grow our business. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet all of our obligations or service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to extend or refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations, which may not be successful.\nAs of April 2, 2018, we had $59.7 million total indebtedness (not including indebtedness related to our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations, which indebtedness is recourse only to the VIE assets on our balance sheet) and there was $10.3 million in borrowing availability under the New RCF. Our indebtedness could have a number of important consequences. For example, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, which could result in an event of default under one or more agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in the general economic, competitive and regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a portion or all of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less highly leveraged, as they may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial part of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to repay our indebtedness depends on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness.\nMuch of our debt is short-term and some of our facilities are not committed and we therefore regularly seek to extend or refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to extend, renew or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is uncertain and may be affected by our financial performance, as well as our regulatory environment, global economic and financial conditions and other factors that are outside of our control.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations or we are unable to extend or refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. We may not be able to accomplish any such measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, these measures may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service or debt obligations. If we cannot fund our debt service and other obligations, the lenders under the New RCF can terminate their commitments to loan money, can declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We were recently forced to file for bankruptcy due to concerns about our ability fund our debt service and ultimately pay or refinance our indebtedness upon its maturity.\nHome Lending\u2019s operations are dependent on access to its warehouse lines of credit, which are uncommitted. If the lenders under these warehouse lines of credit terminate, or modify the terms of, these lines of credit, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Home Lending segment depends on short-term debt financing in the form of secured borrowings under warehouse facilities with financial institutions. These facilities are uncommitted, which means that any request we make to borrow funds under these facilities may be declined for any reason, even if at the time of the borrowing request we have then-outstanding borrowings that are less than the borrowing limits under these facilities. If we breach or trigger the representations and warranties, covenants, events of default, or other terms of our warehouse facilities, we may not be able to obtain additional financing under the warehouse facility when necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, because these warehouse facilities are uncommitted, at any given time we may not be able to obtain additional financing under the warehouse facility when necessary, exposing us to, among other things, liquidity risks which could adversely affect the profitability and operations of this segment.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet the financing requirements of our business.\nWe are currently highly dependent on obtaining financing to fund our purchases of structured settlement payments and other financial assets and our mortgage loan originations. We currently depend on (i) our committed warehouse lines to finance our purchase of structured settlement, annuity, and lottery payment streams prior to their securitization or other financing, (ii) a permanent financing facility for our life contingent structured settlement payments and life contingent annuity payments purchases, (iii) repurchase facilities, participation agreements and warehouse lines of credit with major financial institutions and regional banks to finance our mortgage originations and (iv) the New RCF for general corporate and working capital purposes.\nIn order to access these facilities we are required to meet certain conditions to borrow. In the future we may not be able to meet these conditions, in which case we would be unable to borrow under one or all of our facilities. In addition, these warehouse\nlines and other financing facilities may not continue to be available to us in the future, either beyond their current maturity dates or, in the case of uncommitted warehouse lines, prior to their maturity dates, at reasonable terms or at all. In the future, we will likely need to borrow additional money. Our ability to renew or replace our existing facilities or warehouse lines of credit as they expire and to borrow the additional funds we will need to accomplish our business strategy is affected by a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nour financial condition and performance;\n\u2022\nthe level of liquidity in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the lenders that provide us financing;\n\u2022\nlimitations on borrowings on repurchase facilities, participation agreements and warehouse lines of credit;\n\u2022\nlimitations imposed on us under financing agreements that contain restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions that may limit our ability to raise or borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\naccounting changes that may impact calculations of covenants in our financing agreements.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew, replace or refinance our existing financing arrangements or enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all. An event of default, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and make it difficult for us to renew existing facilities or obtain new financing facilities.\nWe may seek opportunities to acquire financial services businesses that could benefit from our recognized brand name and direct-to-consumer marketing experience. Our liquidity and capital resources may be diminished by any such transactions. Additionally, a significant acquisition may require us to raise additional capital to facilitate such a transaction, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nChanges in federal, state and international regulation of the financial institutions that we rely on for financing could increase the cost of funding for those institutions and therefore reduce our sources of funding and increase our costs. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms for any of the foregoing reasons, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn increase in the cost of our financing sources, especially relative to the discount rate at which we purchase assets, may reduce our profitability.\nOur ability to monetize our structured settlement, annuity, and lottery payment stream purchases depends on our ability to obtain temporary and/or permanent financing at competitive rates, especially relative to our purchase discount rate. If the cost of our financing increases relative to the discount rate at which we are able to purchase assets, our profits will decline. A variety of factors can materially and adversely affect the cost of our financing, including, among others, an increase in interest rates or an increase in the credit spread on our financings relative to underlying benchmark rates. Similarly, a variety of factors can materially adversely affect our purchase discount rate including, among others, increased competition, regulatory and legislative changes, including the imposition of additional or lower rate caps to those currently in effect in certain states in which we operate, the views of courts and other regulatory bodies and the efforts of consumer advocacy groups.\nOur earnings may decrease because of changes in prevailing interest rates.\nOur profitability is directly affected by changes in prevailing interest rates, and volatile interest rate environments can lead to volatility in our results of operations.\nIn our Structured Settlements segment, we purchase structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams at a discount rate based on, among other factors, our estimates of the future interest rate environment. Once a critical mass of payment streams is achieved, those payment streams are then securitized or otherwise financed. The discount rate at which a securitization is sold to investors is based on the current interest rates as of the time of such securitization. Interest rates may fluctuate significantly during the period between the purchase and financing of payment streams, which can reduce the spread between the discount rate at which we purchased the payment streams and the discount rate at which we securitize or otherwise finance such payment streams, which would reduce our revenues. If we are unable to finance the payment streams we purchase at a discount rate that is sufficiently lower than the discount rate at which we make such purchases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn our Home Lending segment, increases in prevailing interests rates could generate an increase in delinquency, default and foreclosure rates resulting in an increase in both operating expenses and interest expense and could cause a reduction in the value of our assets. Increases in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our loan originations volume because refinancing\nan existing loan would be less attractive for homeowners and qualifying for a loan may be more difficult for prospective borrowers. We could also be affected by decreasing interest rates. A decrease in prevailing interest rates may increase prepayment speeds causing our servicing fees to decline more rapidly than anticipated and we may record a decrease in the value of our MSRs. In addition, a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to higher compensating interest expense and increased amortization expense as we revise downward our estimate of total expected income as prepayment speeds increase and could reduce our earnings on custodial deposit accounts.\nOn December 13, 2017, the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% to 1.50%. Recent economic reports and forecasts from federal officials suggest it is possible that the Federal Reserve will further increase interest rates three times during 2018. On March 21, 2018, the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.25% to 1.75%. In the event that interest rates continue to rise, we could be subject to the risks discussed above.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates.\nFrom time to time, we have used various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. The derivative financial instruments that we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risks. In addition, the nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility, and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use financial models and estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may be required to record negative fair value adjustments.\nWe use financial models to value certain of our assets and liabilities. These models are complex and use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Even if the general accuracy of our valuation models is validated, valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the models. In determining the value for such assets and liabilities, we make certain assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, assumptions regarding future interest rates, projected rates of delinquencies, defaults and liquidations, our costs to service loans and prepayment and repayment rates.\nIf these assumptions or relationships prove to be inaccurate, if market conditions change or if errors are found in our models, the value of certain of our assets may decrease. We may be required to record impairment charges, which could impact our ability to satisfy minimum net worth covenants and borrowing conditions in our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe remaining intangible assets that we recorded in connection with previous acquisitions may become impaired.\nIn connection with the accounting for the acquisition of Home Lending and other acquisitions, we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and any other indefinite-lived intangible assets have been impaired. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. We have previously impaired goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the 2011 acquisition of OAC and goodwill associated with the 2015 acquisition of Home Lending. Any further reduction or impairment of the value of our intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders' equity in future periods.\nIncreases in our tax liabilities, as a result of changes in tax or accounting policies applicable to our business or as a result of changes in the operation of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.\nOur U.S. GAAP income may be significantly higher than our taxable income due to current tax and accounting laws and policies. The tax rules applicable to our business are complex and we continue to evaluate our positions and processes. If these laws and policies were to change, or if the operation of our business were to change in a way that affects the application of these laws and policies, we could owe significantly more in income taxes than the cash generated by our operations. If we were unable for any reason to continue purchasing structured settlement annuity, lottery payment streams or other products we could generate significant tax liabilities. In addition, such changes could also have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.\nResiduals from prior securitizations have historically represented a significant portion of our assets, and we may not be able to sell or refinance these residuals in the future.\nAfter a securitization is executed, we retain a subordinated interest in the receivables, referred to as the residuals, which we include within our balance sheet within the caption VIE and other finance receivables, at fair value. If we are required to sell\nor refinance our residuals in order to generate cash for operations, we may not be able to generate proceeds that reflect the value of those residuals on our books. In addition, a sale of the residuals under those circumstances would likely generate taxable income without sufficient cash to pay those taxes. Changes in interest rates, credit spreads and the specific credit of the underlying assets may lead to unrealized losses that negatively affect our U.S. GAAP income.\nAdditionally, certain risk retention requirements promulgated under Dodd-Frank and similar national and international laws could limit our ability to sell or finance our residual interests in the future.\nMore specifically, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 246, also known as \u201cRegulation RR,\u201d requires the sponsor of a securitization transaction (or the majority-owned affiliate of such sponsor) to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets in accordance with any one of \u00a7\u00a7 246.4 through 246.10 thereof. Except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 246.5 through 246.10, \u00a7 246.4 requires that if the sponsor retains only an eligible vertical interest as part of its required risk retention, that such interest represent no less than 5% of the securitized assets. According to Regulation RR, \u201celigible vertical interest\u201d means, with respect to any securitization, a single vertical security or an interest in each class of asset-backed security interests in the issuing entity that constitutes the same proportion of each such class. Additionally, \u00a7 246.4 requires that if the sponsor retains only an eligible horizontal residual interest as part of its required risk retention, that such interest represent no less than 5% of the fair asset value of all asset-backed security interests in the issuing entity issued as part of the securitization. According to Regulation RR, \u201celigible horizontal residual interest\u201d means, with respect to any securitization, an asset-backed security interest in the issuing entity (1) that is an interest in a single class or multiple classes in the issuing entity, provided that each interest meets, individually or in the aggregate, all of the requirements of this definition; (2) with respect to which, on any payment date or allocation date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds to satisfy its obligation to pay all contractual interest or principal due, any resulting shortfall will reduce amounts payable to the eligible horizontal residual interest prior to any reduction in the amounts payable to any other asset-backed security interest, whether through loss allocation, operation of the priority payments, or any other governing contractual provision (until the amount of such asset-backed security interest is reduced to zero); and (3) that, with the exception of any non-economic real estate mortgage investment conduits' residual interest, has the most subordinated claim to payments of both principal and interest by the issuing entity. Finally, if a sponsor retains both an eligible vertical interest and an eligible horizontal residual interest, the percentage of the fair asset value of the eligible horizontal residual interest and the percentage of the eligible vertical interest must equal at least 5. In any case, the percentages of any of the aforementioned interests must be determined as of the closing date of the securitization transaction.\nIn addition, the risk retention rules impose substantial limitations on hedging, transferring or pledging any retained residual interest from securitization transactions closed after the effectiveness of the rules. The Company and its subsidiaries have traditionally pledged their retained residual interests pursuant to special purpose, non-recourse credit facilities. However, they will be substantially limited from doing so for post-effectiveness retained residual interests unless the pledge of such interest meets the requirements of the rules, including that the related facility be full-recourse to an applicable company subsidiary. The current terms of our senior secured credit facility prevent us from entering into such recourse indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash we could possibly receive from financing these residuals, as we have done in the past.\nWe have certain indemnification and repurchase obligations under our various financing facilities driven by potential underwriting risk.\nIn the ordinary course of our financing activities, we provide customary indemnities to counterparties in certain financing and other transactions. No assurance can be given that these counterparties will not call upon us to discharge these obligations in the circumstances under which they are owed. In addition, in connection with financing transactions, in certain instances we retain customary repurchase obligations with respect to any assets sold into or financed under those transactions that fail to meet the represented objective eligibility criteria. Although we believe our origination practices are sufficient to assure material compliance with such criteria, certain instances have and may occur in which we are required to repurchase such assets. Certain of our products have a life contingent aspect, which would cause us to repurchase the obligation and incur losses.\nIn addition, the profitability of our purchases of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams depends on our selection of high quality counterparties and confirmation that there is no senior claim on the payment stream, such as child support or bankruptcy. In the event that one or more of our counterparties is unable or unwilling to make scheduled payments on a payment stream we have purchased, this may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nRisks Related To Our Structured Settlements Segment\nAnnuity providers and other payors could change their payment practices for assignments of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nWe currently have established relationships and experience with various insurance companies as well as state lottery commissions and other payors. Purchases of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams require that the payors of such payment streams redirect payments from the initial payee and change the payee records within their operational and information\ntechnology systems in order to direct the purchased payment streams to us. Often, when we purchase less than all payment streams related to a receivable, the insurance company or other payor directs all of the payments streams to us, and we then take on the administrative responsibility to direct un-purchased payments to the seller or other payees. Moreover, if we complete more than one purchase transaction with a seller, the payor of the payment stream may be required to make further changes in their operational and information technology systems to cover such additional purchase and to allow us to assume additional administrative payment responsibility in order to direct multiple payment streams to different payees. Often, insurance companies or other payors are paid a fee by us in consideration for their costs and expenses in redirecting payments and updating their operational and information technology systems.\nIf, however, in the future, one or more of such insurance companies, lottery commissions or other payors were to no longer be willing to redirect payments to new payees, or allow us to assume administrative responsibility for directing payments, it could become more expensive or no longer possible to purchase structured settlement payments or other receivables paid by such payors, or we could incur significant legal expenses associated with compelling a payor to redirect payment to us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nIf the identities of structured settlement or annuity holders become readily available, it could have an adverse effect on our structured settlements or annuity payment purchasing business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect to continue to build and enhance our databases of holders of structured settlements and annuities through a combination of commercial and digital advertising campaigns, social media activities and targeted marketing efforts. If the identities of structured settlement or annuity holders in our databases were to become readily available to our competitors or to the general public, including through the physical or cyber theft of our databases, we could face increased competition and the value of our proprietary databases would be diminished, which would have a negative effect on our structured settlements and annuity payment purchasing businesses and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on the opinions of certain rating agencies regarding insurance companies we purchase payment streams from, as well as our securitizations, and would be negatively impacted if any of these rating agencies stop rating these insurance companies or our securitizations.\nStandard & Poor's, Moody's and A.M. Best evaluate some, but not all, of the insurance companies that are the payors on the structured settlement, annuity and certain lottery payment streams that we purchase. Similarly, Standard & Poor's, Moody's, A.M. Best and DBRS, Inc. evaluate some, but not all, of our securitizations of those assets. We may be negatively impacted if any of these rating agencies stop covering these insurance companies or decide to downgrade their ratings or change their methodology for rating insurance companies or our securitizations. A downgrade in the credit rating of the major insurance companies that write structured settlements could negatively affect our ability to access the capital, securitization or other markets and we may be required to hold assets longer than initially anticipated. In addition, we may be negatively impacted if any of these rating agencies stop rating our securitizations, which would adversely affect our ability to complete our securitizations and the price that we receive for them. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to complete future securitizations or other financings or sell the payment streams of the structured settlement, annuity or lottery payment streams on favorable terms, then our business will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to aggregate and securitize or otherwise finance or sell many of the financial assets that we purchase, including structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, in the form of privately offered asset-backed securities, direct asset sales, other term financings or private sales. The availability of financing sources is dependent in part on factors outside of our control. For example, our results in 2008 and 2009 were impacted by the financial crisis, which resulted in a lack of purchasers of our asset-backed securitizations and a resultant lack of capital availability from our warehouse facilities. We were forced to limit transaction volume without access to the securitization market and with limited warehouse capacity. We significantly scaled back new transactions, resulting in insufficient cash flow relative to our leverage. In 2009, J.G. Wentworth, LLC and certain of its affiliates completed reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In the future, we may not be able to continue to securitize or otherwise sell our structured settlement payments at favorable rates or obtain financing through borrowings or other means on acceptable terms or at all, in which case we may be unable to satisfy our cash requirements. Our financings generate cash proceeds that allow us to repay amounts borrowed under our committed warehouse lines, finance the purchase of additional financial assets and pay our operating expenses. Changes in our asset-backed securities program could materially adversely affect our earnings and ability to purchase and securitize structured settlement, annuity, or lottery payment streams on a timely basis. These changes could include:\n\u2022\na delay in the completion of a planned securitization or other financing;\n\u2022\nnegative market perception of us;\n\u2022\na change in rating agency criteria with regards our asset class;\n\u2022\ndelays from rating agencies in providing ratings on our securitizations; and\n\u2022\nfailure of the financial assets we intend to securitize to conform to rating agency requirements.\nWe plan to continue to access the securitization and other financing markets frequently. If our senior management does not accurately gauge the appropriate asset mix or timing for a securitization, other financing or asset sale, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If for any reason we were not able to complete a securitization or other financing, it could negatively impact our cash flow during that period. If we are unable to consummate securitizations or other financing or sale transactions in the future or if there is an adverse change in the market for structured settlement, annuity, or lottery payment streams generally, we may have to curtail our activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInsolvency of payors of the structured settlement, annuity and lottery payments we purchase and other similar events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn instances where insurance companies or other payors of the structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment assets we purchase go bankrupt, become insolvent, or are otherwise unable to pay the purchased payment streams on time, we may not be able to collect all or any of the scheduled payments we have purchased. For example, on September 1, 2011, in the Matter of the Rehabilitation of Executive Life Company of New York (\"ELNY\"), in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York filed an Agreement of Restructuring in connection with the liquidation of ELNY under Article 75 of the New York Insurance Laws. This restructuring plan was subsequently approved by the court. Under this plan, payment streams to be paid on certain receivables purchased by us were reduced. In the future, bankruptcies, additional insolvencies and other events may occur which limit the ability of these payors to pay on time and in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to maintain our relationships with the vendors involved with our prepaid cards.\nWe currently serve as program manager for our prepaid cards. We have chosen to partner with third-party service providers to serve as the card-issuer, the card-processor and as our network partner. If any of these vendors were to suspend, limit or cease operations or if our relationship with such service providers were to otherwise terminate, we would need to implement a substantially similar arrangement with another vendor, obtain additional state licenses, or curtail our prepaid operations, as applicable. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements with a different service provider to replace our existing arrangements, we may not be able to negotiate a comparable alternative arrangement in a timely fashion, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Transitioning to a new issuer, processor or network partner may result in delays in the issuance of prepaid cards, which could cause irreparable harm to our brand and reputation.\nFraudulent and other illegal activity involving our prepaid cards could lead to reputational damage to us and reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and reload network.\nCriminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving prepaid cards, reload products or customer information. Illegal activities involving prepaid cards often include malicious social engineering schemes, where people are asked to provide a prepaid card or reload product in order to obtain a loan or purchase goods or services. Illegal activities may also include fraudulent payment or refund schemes and identity theft. We rely upon third parties for some transaction processing services, which subjects us and our customers to risks related to the vulnerabilities of those third parties. A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services, cause network acceptance members to cease doing business with us or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. Fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including significant monetary fines.\nOur payment solutions business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards as a payment mechanism or there are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general.\nAs the prepaid financial services industry evolves, consumers may find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than traditional or other financial services. Consumers might not use prepaid financial services for any number of reasons, including the general perception of our industry or advances in mobile or other payment technologies. Further, negative publicity surrounding other prepaid financial service providers could impact our business and prospects for growth to the extent it adversely impacts the perception of prepaid financial services among consumers. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards, our payment solutions business may not grow as anticipated.\nRisks Related To Our Home Lending Segment\nAdverse changes in the residential mortgage lending and real estate markets would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Home Lending results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the residential mortgage lending and real estate markets, the financial markets and the economy generally. In recent years, concerns about the mortgage market, significant declines in home prices, increases in home foreclosures, high unemployment, the availability and cost of credit and rising government debt levels, as well as inflation, energy costs, U.S. budget debates and European sovereign debt issues, have contributed to increased volatility and uncertainty for the economy and financial markets. The mortgage market continues to be adversely affected by tightened lending standards and decreased availability of credit since the 2008 financial crisis. This has an impact on new demand for homes, which may compress the home ownership rates and weigh heavily on future home price performance. There is a strong correlation between increases (or decreases) in home prices and mortgage loan default rates. Increases in the number of mortgage defaults negatively impact our servicing business because they increase the costs to service the underlying loans and may ultimately reduce the number of mortgage loans we service.\nAdverse economic conditions also adversely impact our mortgage loan originations business. On December 13, 2017, the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% to 1.50%. Recent economic reports and forecasts from federal officials suggest it is possible that the Federal Reserve will further increase interest rates three times during 2018. On March 21, 2018, the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.25% to 1.75%. Rising interest rates would slow home purchase demand and may preclude many potential borrowers from refinancing their existing loans, which would decrease our originations.\nAdverse changes in the residential mortgage market may reduce the number of mortgages we service, reduce the profitability of mortgage loans we currently service, reduce the number of new mortgage loans we originate, adversely affect our ability to sell mortgage loans we originate or increase delinquency rates. Any of the foregoing adverse developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to continue to grow our loan origination volume.\nOur loan origination operations primarily consist of distributed retail and affiliate relationship operations. In our affiliate relationship operations, we generate program leads from our lead-generation partners and originate mortgage loans directly with borrowers through six telephone call centers or the Internet. In our distributed retail operations, we generate leads and originate loans from business and personal referrals as well as from previous customers via our 24 branch locations that are located in 15 states. One of our affinity relationships accounts for a significant portion of our leads for mortgage originations. The volume of loans funded within our loan origination business is subject to multiple factors, including the success of our customer direct originations, our ability to maintain our affinity and lead-generation relationships, changes in interest rates, availability of government programs and consumer credit. Any of these factors could lead to our inability to maintain or grow our loan originations volume, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Home Lending is actively licensed as a mortgage originator in 45 states and the District of Columbia. We plan to become licensed in additional states, which we expect will have a positive impact on our origination growth. However, there are no assurances that we will obtain these additional licenses. If we are unable to obtain additional licenses, we will not be able to grow our business in accordance with our current plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in delinquencies and defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of conditions in the residential mortgage lending and real estate markets in recent years, borrowers may not have sufficient equity in their homes to permit them to refinance their existing loans, which may reduce the volume or growth of our loan production business. This may also provide borrowers with an incentive to default on their mortgage loans even if they have the ability to make principal and interest payments. Further, interest rates have remained at historic lows for an extended period of time, but now appear to be increasing. Borrowers with adjustable rate mortgage loans must make larger monthly payments when the interest rates on those mortgage loans adjust upward from their initial fixed rates or low introductory rates, as applicable, to the rates computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin. Increases in monthly payments may increase the delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures on a significant number of the loans that we service.\nIncreased mortgage delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures may result in lower servicing revenue for loans that we service for the GSEs, including Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, because we only collect servicing fees at the time they are due from GSEs for performing loans. Additionally, while increased delinquencies generate higher ancillary fees, including late fees, these fees are not likely to be recoverable in the event that the related loan is liquidated. In addition, an increase in delinquencies lowers\nthe interest income that we receive on cash held in collection and other accounts because there is less cash in those accounts. Also, increased mortgage defaults may ultimately reduce the number of mortgages that we service.\nIncreased mortgage delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures will also result in a higher cost to service those loans due to the increased time and effort required to collect payments from delinquent borrowers and to liquidate properties or otherwise resolve loan defaults if payment collection is unsuccessful, and only a portion of these increased costs are recoverable under our servicing agreements. Increased mortgage delinquencies, defaults, short sales and foreclosures may also result in an increase in our interest expense and affect our liquidity as a result of borrowing under our credit facilities to fund an increase in our advancing obligations.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies in cases where we might be required to repurchase loans sold with recourse or under representations and warranties. A borrower filing for bankruptcy during foreclosure would have the effect of staying the foreclosure and thereby delaying the foreclosure process, which may potentially result in a reduction or discharge of a borrower's mortgage debt. Even if we are successful in foreclosing on a loan, the liquidation proceeds upon sale of the underlying real estate may not be sufficient to recover our cost basis in the loan, resulting in a loss to us. For example, foreclosure may create a negative public perception of the related mortgaged property, resulting in a diminution of its value. Furthermore, any costs or delays involved in the foreclosure of the property securing the mortgage loan or a liquidation of the underlying property will further reduce the net proceeds and, thus, increase the loss. If these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe geographic concentration of our servicing portfolio may result in a higher rate of delinquencies and/or defaults.\nWe have higher concentrations of loans in our servicing portfolio in Virginia and California. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 17.8% and 22.8% of the loans we serviced as measured by unpaid principal balances were concentrated in Virginia and California, respectively.\nTo the extent the states where we have a higher concentration of loans experience weaker economic conditions, greater rates of decline in single-family residential real estate values or reduced demand within the residential mortgage sector relative to the United States generally, the concentration of loans we service in those regions may increase the effect of these risks. Additionally, if states in which we have greater concentrations of mortgage loans were to change their licensing or other regulatory requirements to significantly increase our business costs, we may be required to stop doing business in those states or may be subject to higher costs of doing business in those states, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs our origination volume increases in the states where we have only recently become licensed and in the additional states where we plan to become licensed, we expect our geographic concentration to change and our origination and servicing of loans could be impacted by geographic concentrations in different states. To the extent those states experience weaker economic conditions or greater rates of decline in single-family residential real estate values, the concentration of loans we originate and service in those regions may increase the effect of the risks to our business.\nWe are highly dependent upon GSEs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales.\nThere are various government proposals which deal with GSE reform, including winding down the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as proposals to implement reforms relating to borrowers, lenders and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of loans that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, improving underwriting standards and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. Thus, the long-term future of the GSEs is in doubt.\nOur ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales depends to a significant degree on GSEs. We sell mortgage loans to GSEs and also rely on programs administered by the GSEs, Ginnie Mae, and others that facilitate the issuance of MBSs in the secondary market. These entities play a critical role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with many of them. Almost all of the conforming loans we originate qualify under existing standards for inclusion in guaranteed mortgage securities backed by one of these entities. We also derive other material financial benefits from these relationships, including the assumption of credit risk on loans included in such mortgage securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees and the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures. If we are unable to complete the sale or securitization of certain of our mortgage loans due to changes in GSE programs or if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to GSEs, we may lack liquidity under our mortgage financing facilities to continue to fund mortgage loans and our revenues and margins on new loan originations would be materially and negatively impacted.\nAny discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of the GSEs or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of the GSEs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGSE actions may negatively impact our MSRs and business.\nIn January 2011, the FHFA instructed the GSEs to study possible alternatives to the current residential mortgage servicing and compensation system used for single-family mortgage loans. The FHFA has released progress reports on the implementation of these efforts and outlined (i) the development of a new Contractual and Disclosure Framework that will align the contracts and data disclosures that support the mortgage-backed securities and set uniform contracts and standards for MBSs that carry no or only a partial federal guarantee; (ii) the development of a common securitization platform that will perform major elements of the securitization process and eventually act as the agent of an issuer; and (iii) the initiation of a Uniform Mortgage Data Program to implement uniform data standards for single-family mortgages. There can be no certainty regarding what the GSEs may propose as alternatives to current servicing compensation practices, or when any such alternatives would become effective.\nAlthough MSRs that have already been created may not be subject to any changes implemented by the GSEs, it is possible that, because of the significant role of GSEs in the secondary mortgage market, any changes they implement could become prevalent in the mortgage servicing industry generally. Other industry stakeholders or regulators may also implement or require changes in response to the perception that the current mortgage servicing practices and compensation do not appropriately serve broader housing policy objectives. Changes to the residential mortgage servicing and compensation system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur counterparties may terminate our MSRs.\nThe owners of the loans we service may, under certain circumstances, terminate our MSRs. Ginnie Mae may terminate our status as an issuer if we fail to comply with servicing standards or otherwise breach our agreement with Ginnie Mae, or if there is a concern of the overall economic conditions and performance of our enterprise. If this were to happen, Ginnie Mae would seize our MSRs without compensation. As is standard in the industry, under the terms of our master servicing agreements with GSEs, GSEs have the right to terminate us as servicer of the loans we service on their behalf at any time and the GSEs also have the right to cause us to sell the MSRs to a third party. In addition, failure to comply with servicing standards could result in termination of our agreements with GSEs. Some GSEs may also have the right to require us to assign the MSRs to a subsidiary and sell our equity interest in the subsidiary to a third party. If we were to have our servicing rights terminated on a material portion of our servicing portfolio, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to maintain or grow our business if we cannot originate and/or acquire MSRs on favorable terms.\nOur servicing portfolio is subject to \"run off,\" meaning that mortgage loans we service may be prepaid prior to maturity, refinanced by a mortgage loan not serviced by us, liquidated through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or other liquidation process, or repaid through standard amortization of principal. As a result, our ability to maintain and grow the size of our servicing portfolio depends on our ability to originate additional mortgages, to recapture the servicing rights on loans that are refinanced and to acquire MSRs. We may not be able to originate a sufficient volume of mortgage loans, recapture a sufficient volume of refinanced loans or acquire MSRs on terms that are favorable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to recapture loans from borrowers who refinance.\nOne of the focuses of our origination efforts is \"recapture,\" which involves actively working with existing borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans with us instead of another originator of mortgage loans. Borrowers who refinance have no obligation to refinance their loans with us and may choose to refinance with a different originator. If borrowers refinance with different originators, this decreases the profitability of our primary servicing portfolio because the original loan will be repaid, and we will not have an opportunity to earn further servicing fees after the original loan is repaid. Moreover, recapture allows us to generate additional loan servicing rights more cost-effectively than MSRs acquired on the open market. If we are not successful in recapturing our existing loans that are refinanced, our servicing portfolio will become increasingly subject to run-off, which would increase our costs and risks and decrease the profitability of our servicing business.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about borrowers, counterparties and other third parties, which could be intentionally or negligently misrepresented.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with borrowers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of borrowers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of borrowers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. We additionally rely on representations from public officials concerning the licensing and good standing of the third-party mortgage brokers through which we do business.\nIf any material information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected and we may be subject to repurchase or indemnification obligations under loan sales agreements. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, the mortgage broker, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Even though we may have rights against persons and entities who made or knew about the misrepresentation, such persons and entities are often difficult to locate and it is often difficult to collect any monetary losses that we have suffered as a result of their actions. We have controls and processes designed to help us identify misrepresented information in our loan originations operations; however, we may not have detected or may not detect all misrepresented information in our loan originations or from our mortgage business clients. Any such misrepresented information could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInsurance on real estate securing mortgage loans and real estate securities collateral may not cover all losses.\nThere are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, that result from such events as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, acts of war or terrorism and that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make the insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed. Under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected real property. Any uninsured loss could result in the loss of cash flow from, and a decrease in the asset value of, the affected property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to indemnify purchasers of the mortgage loans we originate or of the MBSs backed by such loans or to repurchase the related loans if the loans fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics.\nThe indentures governing our securitized pools of mortgage loans and our contracts with purchasers of our whole loans contain provisions that require us to indemnify purchasers of the loans we originate or of the MBSs backed by such loans or to repurchase the related loans under certain circumstances. While our contracts vary, they contain provisions that require us to repurchase loans if:\n\u2022\nour representations and warranties concerning loan characteristics, loan quality and loan circumstances are inaccurate;\n\u2022\nwe fail to secure adequate mortgage insurance within a certain period after closing;\n\u2022\na mortgage insurance provider denies coverage; or\n\u2022\nwe fail to comply, at the individual loan level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in the current dynamic regulatory environment.\nWe believe that, as a result of the current market environment, many purchasers of residential mortgage loans are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify them or repurchase loans they have purchased and would benefit from enforcing any indemnification and repurchase remedies they may have. Our exposure to repurchases under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all loans we have sold. If we are required to indemnify or repurchase loans that we originate and sell or securitize that result in losses that exceed our reserve, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to follow the guidelines of Ginnie Mae and the GSEs and are not able to negotiate our fees with these entities for the purchase of our loans.\nIn our transactions with Ginnie Mae and the GSEs, we are required to follow specific guidelines that impact the way we service and originate mortgage loans including:\n\u2022\nour staffing levels and other servicing practices;\n\u2022\nthe servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge;\n\u2022\nour modification standards and procedures; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of non-reimbursable advances.\nIn particular, the FHFA has directed GSEs to align their guidelines for servicing delinquent mortgages they own or guarantee, which can result in monetary incentives for servicers that perform well and penalties for those that do not. In addition, FHFA has directed Fannie Mae to assess compensatory fees against servicers in connection with delinquent loans, foreclosure delays, and other breaches of servicing obligations.\nWe cannot negotiate these terms with the GSEs, and they are subject to change at any time. A significant change in these guidelines that has the effect of decreasing our fees or requiring us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services\ncould decrease our revenues or increase our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to make servicing advances that can be subject to delays in recovery or may not be recoverable in certain circumstances.\nDuring any period in which a borrower is not making payments, we are required under most of our servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors, pay property taxes and insurance premiums, pay legal expenses and fund other protective advances. We also advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties that we service that are in the foreclosure process or have been foreclosed. As home values change, we may have to reconsider certain of the assumptions underlying our decisions to make advances and, in certain situations, our contractual obligations may require us to make certain advances for which we may not be reimbursed. In addition, in the event a mortgage loan serviced by us defaults or becomes delinquent, the repayment to us of the advance may be delayed until the mortgage loan is repaid or refinanced or liquidation occurs. With respect to loans in Ginnie Mae pools, advances are not recovered until the loan becomes current or we make a claim with the FHA or other insurer, and our right to reimbursement is capped. Advances are typically recovered upon weekly or monthly reimbursement or from sale in the market. An increase in delinquency and default rates on the loans that we service will increase the need for us to make advances. In the event we receive requests for advances in excess of amounts we are able to fund, we may not be able to fund these advance requests, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investments in mortgage loans and MSRs may become illiquid, and we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions.\nOur investments in mortgage loans and MSRs may become illiquid. If that were to occur, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain or validate third party pricing on the investments we purchase. Illiquid investments also typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. We cannot predict if our mortgage loans or MSRs may become illiquid, or when such event may occur, though some factors that have contributed to periods of illiquidity for these assets generally in the past have been weak economic conditions, rates of decline in single-family residential real estate values and volatile interest rates. Any illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the recorded value.\nRisks Related to Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the bankruptcy could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, vendors, employees, service providers and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nvendors or other contract counterparties could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and reputation.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our projections filed with the Bankruptcy Court in the course of our Chapter 11 Cases, and will not be comparable to our historical financial results as a result of the implementation of our Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nWe filed with the Bankruptcy Court projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of our Plan and our ability to continue operations following our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the Chapter 11 Cases and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to then prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide\nvariety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on those projections.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly. Following emergence, our Board of Directors now consists of five directors, none of which, except for Stewart A. Stockdale, our Chief Executive Officer, previously served on our Board of Directors. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on our Board of Directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. There is no guarantee that the new Board of Directors will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, strategic plans consistent with those pursued by the Company under the prior Board of Directors. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe ability of the new directors to quickly expand their knowledge of our business plans, operations and strategies in a timely manner will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about our strategy and operations. If our Board of Directors is not sufficiently informed to make such decisions, our ability to compete effectively and profitably could be adversely affected.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nThe change of ownership rules under Section 382 of the Code, as well as our emergence from bankruptcy, may limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income.\nWe have net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes. Generally, NOL carryforwards can be used to reduce future taxable income. Our use of our NOL carryforwards may be limited, however, under Section 382 of the Code, if we undergo a change in ownership of more than 50% of our common stock over a three-year period as measured under Section 382 of the Code. The complex change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of our stock, including certain public \u201cgroups\u201d of stockholders as set forth under Section 382 of the Code, including those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions. It is possible that we will experience another ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code resulting in an annual limit on the use of our NOL carryforwards. This limitation could result in a meaningful increase in our federal and state income tax liability in future years. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is complex. No assurance can be given that we will not undergo an ownership change that would have a significant adverse effect on the use of our NOL carryforwards. In addition, the possibility of causing an ownership change may reduce our willingness to issue new common stock to raise capital.\nA special exception from the Section 382 limitation rules discussed above may apply in the case of a corporation that experiences an ownership change as the result of a bankruptcy proceeding. Under that exception, if certain claimants receive the loss corporation\u2019s stock under the bankruptcy plan, although an ownership change may have occurred, there would be no limitation on the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its NOLs under Section 382. However, the application of such exception may require the company to reduce the amount of the NOL carryforward. We have not yet determined whether or not this exception applies in the context of our emergence from bankruptcy. If this exception does not apply, our ability to utilize our NOLs in the future may be severely limited.\nUnder the Plan, our pre-petition debt and certain other obligations were canceled and extinguished. Absent an exception, a debtor recognizes cancellation of debt income (\u201cCODI\u201d) upon discharge of its outstanding indebtedness for an amount of consideration that is less than its adjusted issue price. In accordance with Section 108, we will exclude the amount of discharged indebtedness from taxable income since the Code provides that a debtor in a bankruptcy case may exclude CODI from income but must reduce certain tax attributes by the amount of CODI realized as a result of the consummation of a plan of reorganization. The amount of CODI realized by a taxpayer is the adjusted issue price of any indebtedness discharged less than the sum of (i) the amount of cash paid, (ii) the issue price of any new indebtedness issued, and (iii) the fair market value of any other consideration, including equity, issued. As a result of the CODI, we may be required to reduce the amount of the NOL carryovers.\nNewly enacted laws, such as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or regulations and future changes in the U.S. taxation of businesses may impact our effective tax rate or may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly changed the Code, reducing in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and adding a new limitation on the\ndeductibility of business interest expense and restrictions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions. We are still in the process of analyzing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and its possible effects on the Company. We cannot predict how the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, regulations, or other guidance issued under it or conforming or non-conforming state tax rules might affect us or our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that U.S. tax laws, including the corporate income tax rate, will not undergo significant changes in the near future.\nRisks Related To Ownership Of Our Common Stock\nThe New Common Stock is subject to certain transfer restrictions.\nAfter our filing Form 15 on January 5, 2018, we are no longer required to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, other than this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our New Common Stock is not publicly traded and is subject to restrictions on transfers, among others, that any transfers must be approved by our Board of Directors or pursuant to general terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors, which may include that transfers be subject to (i) a right of first refusal subject to certain ownership thresholds, (ii) compliance with applicable securities laws generally for such transfers and (iii) such other conditions to be determined by our Board of Directors to ensure the Company will not incur obligations to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such transfer restrictions and the terms thereof are set forth in our governing documents.\nThe ability to transfer the New Common Stock may be limited by the absence of an active trading market and the New Common Stock is not registered.\nPrior to our emergence from bankruptcy, our Class A common stock was traded on the over-the-counter markets. In connection with our Plan, we suspended our reporting obligations under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and delisted the Class A common stock from the OTC. All of the Company's New Common Stock is subject to restrictions on transfer as set forth in our governing documents. We do not expect to register any of the New Common Stock under the Securities Act.\nAs a result of these actions, an active trading market for the New Common Stock may not be developed or maintained in the future or, even if developed, may not be liquid. The liquidity of any market for the New Common Stock will depend on various factors, including the number of holders of the New Common Stock and the interest of security dealers in making a market for the New Common Stock. If an active trading market is not developed and maintained or such trading market is not liquid, holders of New Common Stock may be unable to sell their New Common Stock at fair market value or at all. Consequently, holders of the New Common Stock may bear certain risks associated with holding securities for an indefinite period of time, including, but not limited to, the risk that the New Common Stock will lose some or all of its value. No assurance can be given that the liquidity of any trading market may develop, that the holders of the New Common Stock will be able to sell their New Common Stock or on the price at which holders would be able to sell their New Common Stock.\nWe have suspended ongoing reporting obligations with respect to our SEC filings.\nWe have filed a Form 15 to terminate our ongoing reporting obligations. We expect that we will no longer be required to file any current or periodic reports with the SEC as and when due going forward. Accordingly, subject to the provisions contained in our governance documents, holders of New Common Stock, or any potential buyers of New Common Stock from such holders, will no longer have access to ongoing and updated reports and results from the Company. Consequently, holders of the New Common Stock may bear certain risks associated with holding securities of a non-reporting company, including increased difficulty in valuing and transferring the New Common Stock.\nWe are under no obligation to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions.\nWe are under no obligation, and do not expect, to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions on account of the New Common Stock. The terms of any such distributions are set forth in our governance documents. In addition, the New RCF Agreement significantly restricts certain of our subsidiaries' ability, and therefore our ability, to make distributions and certain other payments. Consequently, a holder\u2019s only ability to recognize a return on the New Common Stock may be through the sale of the New Common Stock.\nThe New Common Stock is subject to dilution.\nThe New Common Stock is subject to dilution as a result of the issuance of new equity securities. In addition, our Board of Directors may agree to grant equity securities to employees, consultants and directors under certain management incentive plans that may result in additional issuances of New Common Stock or rights with respect thereto. Furthermore, we may issue equity securities in connection with future investments, acquisitions or capital raising transactions. Such grants or issuances may result in substantial dilution in ownership of the New Common Stock.\nCertain rights under our governance documents are based on ownership percentages of the New Common Stock.\nCertain rights under our governance documents are limited to holders of New Common Stock holding specified percentages of the outstanding New Common Stock. For example, only those holders above certain percentage thresholds may be provided with registration rights, including demand, shelf and piggyback rights, certain consent rights over corporate actions, preemptive rights and/or a right of first refusal on any proposed transfers of the New Common Stock. Such thresholds and the terms of such rights are set forth in our governance documents.\nAs a holding company, we have no operations and our only material asset is our economic interest in JGW LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from JGW LLC to pay our expenses, including payments with respect to our indebtedness, taxes and dividends (if and when declared by our Board of Directors).\nWe are a holding company and have no material direct operations or assets other than our ownership of common membership interests in JGW LLC (\u201cCommon Interests\u201d). We have no independent means of generating revenue and as a result are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. We intend to cause JGW LLC to make distributions to us, as its managing member, in an amount sufficient to cover all expenses, including payments with respect to our indebtedness, applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by our Board of Directors. However, our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, it is likely that Ginnie Mae will place restrictions on the cash generated by Home Lending such that it can only be used for Home Lending's operations and, thus, cannot be used to assist with the repayment of indebtedness at the corporate level. Furthermore, the New RCF Agreement governing the New RCF significantly restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us. To the extent that we need funds and JGW LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under any present or future debt covenants or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHolders of the New Common Stock may not be able to recover in future cases of bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency, or reorganization.\nHolders of the New Common Stock will be subordinated to all liabilities of the Company, JGW LLC and their subsidiaries, including the indebtedness under the New RCF Agreement. Therefore, the assets of the Company and JGW LLC will not be available for distribution to any holder of the New Common Stock in any bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or JGW LLC unless and until all indebtedness, if any, of the Company, JGW LLC and their subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement (to the extent any loans thereunder are outstanding) has been paid. The remaining assets of the Company, JGW LLC and each of their subsidiaries may not be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding claims of its equity holders, including the holders of the New Common Stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.", "PERMNO": 14288, "SIC": 6153, "TIC": "JGWEQ"}
