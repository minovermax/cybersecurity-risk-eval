{"cik": "1431372", "company": "Gastar Exploration Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following material risk factors associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in which we operate. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\nAn investment in Gastar is subject to risks inherent in our business. The trading price of our common shares will be affected by the performance of our business relative to, among other things, competition, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions. The value of an investment in Gastar may decrease, resulting in a loss.\nOil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices are volatile. Substantial declines in commodity prices have significantly and negatively affected our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends primarily on the market prices of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs. Oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices are set by broad market forces, which have been and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. In late 2014, commodity prices declined significantly as a result of several factors, including increased worldwide supplies, a stronger U.S. dollar, weather factors, a strong competition among oil producing countries for market share and decreased demand in emerging markets. Although commodity prices rose during 2017, a buildup in inventories, lower global demand or other factors could cause prices for U.S. oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs to weaken, which could negatively affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nLower realized prices also may reduce the amount of oil, condensate, natural gas or NGLs that we can produce economically. Prices for oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, condensate, natural gas or NGLs, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe domestic and foreign supply and demand of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nVolatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets;\n\u2022\nOverall economic conditions and market uncertainty;\n\u2022\nWeather conditions;\n\u2022\nThe cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting and marketing natural gas, condensate, oil and NGLs;\n\u2022\nThe proximity to, and capacity of, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nPolitical conditions in the Middle East and other oil producing regions, such as Venezuela;\n\u2022\nDomestic and foreign governmental regulations; and\n\u2022\nThe price and availability of competing alternative fuels.\nThe long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs are uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022\nAdversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations and our ability to meet our financial covenants under our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nReducing the amount of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically;\n\u2022\nCausing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;\n\u2022\nReducing our revenues, operating income or cash flows;\n\u2022\nReducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nReducing the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties;\n\u2022\nReducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nReducing or eliminating our ability to pay cash dividends on our outstanding preferred stock; and\n\u2022\nLimiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nOur success is influenced by oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices in the specific areas where we operate, and these prices could be lower than prices at major markets.\nRegional oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices may move independently of broad industry price trends. Because some of our operations are located outside major markets, we are directly impacted by regional prices regardless of Henry Hub, WTI or other major market pricing.\nWe are highly leveraged and may not be able to generate sufficient cash or cash flows, as applicable, to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such agreements, which may not be successful, or if successful, could be highly dilutive to existing holders of our common and preferred stock.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations and to meet related covenants applicable to our debt instruments, including our senior secured first lien term loan facility which had an outstanding principal balance of $256.6 million at December 31, 2017 (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and our $162.5 million of outstanding Convertible Notes due 2022 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control, as well as our ability to complete pending and proposed asset sales. As of March 12 2018, our cash balance was approximately $100.6 million. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.\nOur level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to support the payment of debt service;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, and putting us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have fewer fixed obligations and greater cash flows to devote to their businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in operating our business and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nOur ability in the future to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the indentures governing our Notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Term Loan and the indentures governing our Notes currently restrict our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due including required repayments of amounts owed under our Term Loan as a result of such dispositions. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations, we would be forced to restructure our indebtedness and equity capitalization. Depending upon asset values and other factors, any future restructuring could be highly dilutive to existing holders of our common and preferred stock, could result in equity holders losing a significant amount or all of their investment in us and may adversely affect the trading prices and values of our existing debt and equity securities.\nIf by April 30, 2018, we do not pay all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock in cash, we may be required to issue a significant number of shares of common stock dividends to holders of our outstanding preferred stock, which will dilute our common stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have two series of perpetual preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate stated value liquidation preference of $154.6 million. Commencing in August 2017, we suspended payment of the regular monthly dividends on the two series of preferred stock. If we do not or cannot pay accumulated dividends on our outstanding preferred stock in cash by April 30, 2018, we may be required to issue shares of common stock by May 31, 2018 to pay all accumulated and unpaid dividends, which would aggregate approximately $12.3 million as of such date (assuming no issuance of cash dividends before such date), and pay all future monthly dividends in common stock, in each case\nassuming our common stock is then listed on a national securities exchange or market and we have surplus as determined under Delaware law at that time equal to or in excess of the par value of the common stock issued as dividends. Under the terms of the certificates of designations applicable to our two outstanding series of preferred stock, the number of shares of common stock issued in lieu of cash dividends are determined based upon a ten day average last sale trading price of the common stock immediately prior (or reasonably close) to the date of such dividend payment. If such average last sale price in May 2018 were equal to our last sale price at March 12, 2018 of $0.74 per share and assuming we have not issued any preferred cash dividends prior to such date, we would be obligated to issue approximately 16.6 million shares of our common stock in May 2018 (including shares for the May 2018 monthly dividend, which is accrued at a higher rate as described in the following paragraph) to holders of our outstanding preferred stock as dividends in lieu of cash dividends.\nIn the event all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock are not paid in full in cash by April 30, 2018, unless and until all accrued and unpaid preferred stock dividends are paid in full in cash for the most recent two calendar quarters, (i) the fixed rate of dividends accruing after such date on each of our two outstanding series of preferred stock will increase by 2.00% per annum (ii) dividends commencing in May 2018, if not paid in cash, will be required to be paid monthly in common stock, or in the event our common stock is not traded on an exchange, additional \u201cpay in kind\u201d shares of our preferred stock series, in each case to the extent legally able to do so under Delaware law and (iii) the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, will have the right to elect up to two additional directors to our board of directors. In such event, the monthly dividend requirement for our currently outstanding preferred stock would increase to approximately $1.5 million per month for all outstanding shares of preferred stock, an increase of $258,000 per month. If the average last sale price in months following May 2018 were equal to our last sale price at March 12, 2018 of $0.74 per share and assuming we have not issued preferred cash dividends prior to such date, we would be obligated to issue approximately 2.0 million shares of our common stock monthly for each of the months following May 2018.\nAs a result, a significant number of newly issued shares of common stock may be issued as dividends on our outstanding preferred stock after April 30, 2018, which issuances will dilute the ownership of our common stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. If our common stock ceases to be listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities market, \u201cpay in kind\u201d dividends of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may be payable in lieu of cash or common stock dividends, which would also have an dilutive effect on our common stock and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe covenants in our Term Loan and Notes restrict us from paying cash dividends on our outstanding preferred stock after August 1, 2018, unless we meet a fixed charge coverage ratio test, and we may not be able to pay such dividends in the future.\nThere is no assurance when or if we will be able to pay cash dividends under our covenants applicable to our Term Loan or Notes, including accumulated and unpaid dividends, on our outstanding two series of preferred stock in the future. To be able to pay such dividends, we must meet a fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing twelve months of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 from August 1, 2018, to, but excluding May 1, 2019 and of not less than 1.25 to 1.0 from and after May 1, 2019. We may in the future, in lieu of cash dividends, elect or be required to pay accumulated and unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock by issuing shares of our common stock, as provided in the certificates of designation of rights and preferences setting forth the terms of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, which issuance will dilute our existing common shareholders. If we fail to pay full cash dividends for any month in each of four calendar quarters, then holders of our outstanding Series A and Series B Preferred Stock, may be issued shares of common stock as dividends, or under certain circumstances, additional \u201cpay in kind\u201d shares of preferred stock, and have the right to elect up to two directors to the board of directors of the Company, as described in the immediately preceding risk factor.\nOur development operations will require substantial capital expenditures in order to grow or maintain our production levels. Our limited access to the funds for necessary future growth and maintenance capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay cash dividends to our preferred stockholders and to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We expect to make substantial growth and maintenance capital expenditures in our business for the development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our preferred stockholders and to service our indebtedness. Our preliminary capital budget for 2018 totals approximately $115.0 million, including capitalized costs, which we expect to fund these expenditures using existing cash balances, property sales proceeds, possible financing activities and cash generated internally from our operations.\nOur cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nOur estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nThe amount of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs that we produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nThe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u2022\nThe costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nOur ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nThe ability and willingness of banks to lend to us; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to access the capital markets.\nIn the current oil and natural gas price environment, our sources of capital are constrained. Our failure to obtain the funds for capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay cash dividends to our preferred stockholders and to service our indebtedness. Further, the Indenture governing our Notes and the agreement governing our Term Loan restrict us from incurring additional borrowings. Even if we are successful in obtaining additional borrowings, the terms of such financings could be highly dilutive to our equity or be available only at significantly higher interest rates. These funds, if available, may limit or prohibit paying cash dividends to our preferred stockholders and to service our indebtedness. In addition, incurring additional debt will increase our already significant financial leverage.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception and may incur additional significant net losses in the future.\nWith the exception of the one-time sale of our Australian properties in 2009, recognition of a $27.7 million non-cash gain on acquisition of assets at fair value for the Chesapeake Energy Corporation acquisition, and subsequent sale of certain properties acquired from Chesapeake, which resulted in net income of $40.0 million in 2013, and recognition of a $23.9 million gain attributable to the change in mark to market of commodity derivatives contracts held at December 31, 2014 and an $8.6 million net arbitration settlement which resulted in net income of $36.5 million in 2014, we have not been profitable since we started our business. Our capital has been employed in an increasingly expanding oil and natural gas exploration and development program, with our focus on finding significant oil and natural gas reserves and producing from them over the long-term rather than focusing on achieving immediate net income. The uncertainties described in this Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K may impede our ability to ultimately find, develop, exploit or maintain our oil and natural gas reserves. Our failure to achieve profitability in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and continue our exploration and development program.\nHedging of our production may result in losses or prevent us from benefiting to the fullest extent possible from increases in prices for oil and natural gas.\nWe have entered into NYMEX futures contracts as hedges on approximately 1,200,000 Bbls of crude production and 2.4 Bcf of natural gas production in 2018 and 967,000 Bbls of crude production in 2019 as of December 31, 2017. In light of recent significant fluctuation in oil and natural gas prices, the continued benefit these hedges provide will diminish should energy commodities futures market pricing improve. In addition, the use of these arrangements also may limit our ability to benefit from significant increases in the prices of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs.\nAny disruptions in production, development of proved oil and natural gas reserves, or our ability to process and sell oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs from our properties in the Mid-Continent would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or reduce future revenues.\nOur current production is geographically concentrated in the Mid-Continent. Production in the Mid-Continent could unexpectedly be disrupted or curtailed due to reservoir or mechanical problems or governmental actions limiting or shutting-in production.\nOur producing properties are concentrated in the Mid-Continent, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nFollowing the completion of our Appalachian Basin Sale in 2016, our producing properties and all of our proved reserves are geographically concentrated in the Mid-Continent, with a particular concentration in Oklahoma. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by and costs associate with governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, water shortages, natural disasters such as earthquakes or weather related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, condensate, natural gas or NGLs and changes in regional and local political regimes and regulations. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to market our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs may be impaired by capacity constraints and availability of the gathering systems and pipelines that transport our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs.\nThe availability of a ready market for our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs production depends on the proximity of our reserves to and the capacity of natural gas gathering and processing systems, pipelines and trucking or terminal facilities. We do not own or operate any natural gas lines or distribution facilities and rely on third parties to construct additional interstate pipelines to increase our ability to bring our production to market. We enter into agreements with companies that own pipelines used to transport natural gas from the wellhead to contract destination. Those pipelines are limited in size and volume of natural gas flow.\nFurther, interstate transportation of natural gas is regulated by the federal government through the FERC. FERC sets rules and carries out administratively the oversight of interstate markets for natural gas and other energy policy. Additionally, state regulators have powers over sale, supply and delivery of oil and natural gas within their state borders. While we employ certain companies to represent our interests before state regulatory agencies, our interests may not receive favorable rulings from any state agency, or some future occurrence may drastically alter our ability to enter into contracts or deliver natural gas to the market.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could increase our costs of compliance and delay or restrict our ability to dispose of produced water generated by our drilling and production operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe inject into disposal wells significant volumes of produced water generated in connection with our drilling and production operations, pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. There exists a growing concern that the injection of produced water into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, including Oklahoma, where we operate. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are pursuing initiatives designed to impose additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for injection wells that impose certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on injection wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend injection well operations. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (\u201cOCC\u201d) has implemented a variety of measures including adopting the National Academy of Science\u2019s \u201ctraffic light system,\u201d pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted and, further, evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors. In December 2016, the OCC\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator\u2019s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, the OCC\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Division issued an order in February 2017 limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected belowground into the Arbuckle formation and imposed further reductions in the Edmond area of the state in August 2017.\nAnother consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that injection well disposal operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules governing waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of produced water into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where produced water injection activities occur or are proposed to be performed. Court decisions or the adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater generated by production and development activities, whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of salt water disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 58% of our proved reserves are classified as proved undeveloped at December 31, 2017 and may ultimately prove to be less than current reserves estimates.\nAt December 31, 2017, approximately 58% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped and all were located in the Mid-Continent. It will take approximately $280.6 million of capital to drill our undeveloped locations over the next five years. Our estimate of proved reserves at December 31, 2017 assumes that we will spend in 2018 and 2019 development capital expenditures to develop these reserves of $30.6 million and $71.3 million, respectively. Further, our drilling efforts may be delayed or unsuccessful and actual reserves may prove to be less than current reserve estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and our results of operations. Absent significant price increases, sustained low oil and natural gas prices could impact our\nproved reserves and related PV-10 adversely as the prices used for such estimates under SEC rules are based on the trailing 12-month unweighted average prices. Lower prices used in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in volumes due to economic limits or render undeveloped reserves non-economic, which in turn may make it more likely that we will incur impairment charges in the future against our oil and natural gas properties under full cost accounting. In addition, oil and natural gas prices sustained at current or lower levels and the resultant impact such prices may have on our drilling economics and our ability to raise capital could require us to re-evaluate and postpone our development drilling, which could result in the reduction of some of our proved undeveloped reserves.\nOil and natural gas reserves are depleting assets, and the failure to replace our reserves would adversely affect our production and cash flows.\nOur future oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs production depends on our success in finding or acquiring new reserves. If we fail to replace reserves, our level of production and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Production from oil and natural gas properties decline as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our total proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities and/or acquire properties containing proved reserves. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Further, we may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nExploration is a high risk activity, and our participation in drilling activities may not be successful.\nOur future success will largely depend on the success of our exploration drilling program. Participation in exploration drilling activities involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nUnexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\nBlowouts, fires or explosions with resultant injury, death or environmental or natural resource damages;\n\u2022\nPressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nEnvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, crude oil and produced water spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering NORM and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the environment;\n\u2022\nUncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil, brine water or drilling fluids;\n\u2022\nEquipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes;\n\u2022\nAdverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nCompliance with existing and any future governmental laws and regulations, including environmental requirements;\n\u2022\nStockholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to limit sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nShortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment or obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations.\nReserve estimates depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates, which may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present values of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves.\nThere are many uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values, many of which are beyond our control. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas or oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil or natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend on many variables and assumptions, such as:\n\u2022\nHistorical oil or natural gas production from that area, compared with production from other producing areas;\n\u2022\nAssumptions concerning the effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nAssumptions concerning future prices;\n\u2022\nAssumptions concerning future transportation and operating costs;\n\u2022\nAssumptions concerning severance and excise taxes; and\n\u2022\nAssumptions concerning development costs and workover and remedial costs.\nAny of these variables or assumptions could vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil or natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineer at different times, may vary substantially. Because of this, our reserve estimates may materially change at any time.\nYou should not consider the present values of estimated future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10-K to be the current market value of the estimated reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices and costs in effect when the estimate is made. Current or actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nThe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nSupply and demand for oil or natural gas;\n\u2022\nActual prices received for oil or natural gas in the future being different than those used in the estimate;\n\u2022\nCurtailments or increases in consumption of oil or natural gas;\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental regulations or taxation; and\n\u2022\nThe timing of both production and expenses in connection with the development and production of oil or natural gas properties.\nIn this report, the net present value of estimated future net revenues of our proved reserves at December 31, 2017 is calculated using the historical 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices which differ from current oil and natural gas prices. These average prices and the 10% discount rate are not necessarily the most appropriate price or discount factor based on prices and interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nFuture downward revisions of the present value of our proved reserves and increased drilling expenditures without current additions to proved reserves may lead to write downs in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We are subject to the full cost ceiling limitation which has resulted in past write-downs of estimated net reserves and may result in a write-down in the future if commodity prices continue to decline.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a \u201cceiling\u201d or limitation on the amount of our oil and natural gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. We may continue to experience write downs of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in the future if the present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves is lower than our remaining unamortized capitalized costs. If the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the cost ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test write-down of our estimated net reserves to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders\u2019 equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile similar to the current market. In addition, a write-down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, if there are differences in timing between the incurrence of significant costs of exploration or development activities and the recognition of significant proved reserves resulting from such activities and if we experience unsuccessful drilling activities. Expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable in the subsequent period. Absent significant price increases, sustained lower oil and natural gas prices continue to impact our proved reserves and related PV-10 adversely as the prices used for such estimates under SEC rules are based on the trailing 12-month unweighted average prices. Lower prices used in\nestimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in volumes due to economic limits or render undeveloped reserves non-economic, which in turn may make it more likely that we will incur impairment charges in the future against our oil and natural gas properties under full cost accounting.\nWe cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate, which may affect the timing and success of our future operations.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest, specifically the Mid-Continent oil play. As a result, we have a limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nTiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nThe operator\u2019s operating expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\nApproval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nSelection of drilling and completion technology.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 63 gross (8.6 net) wells in which we have an interest were operated by other companies, representing 24% of our total gross wells (5% of our total net wells).\nThe indenture governing our Notes and the agreement governing our Term Loan impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness and may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing our Notes and the agreement governing our Term Loan contain customary restrictions on our activities, including covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to:\n\u2022\nTransfer or sell assets or use asset sale proceeds;\n\u2022\nIncur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred equity securities;\n\u2022\nPay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nMake certain investments;\n\u2022\nCreate or incur certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nIncur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nEnter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nMerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nEnter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nTake or omit to take any actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing the Notes.\nFor more information, see Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4. Long-Term Debt.\u201d\nThe restrictions in the indenture governing the Notes and in the agreement governing our Term Loan may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The breach of any of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the Notes or under the agreement governing our Term Loan. An event of default under our Term Loan could permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable.\nAres Management LLC, which manages the affiliated funds that hold substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness and are also the largest beneficial owners of our common stock, has the ability to influence our business plan significantly and may have interests that differ from our management and other shareholders.\nOn March 3, 2017, we refinanced all of our outstanding indebtedness with the initial issuance of a $250.0 million senior secured first lien five-year Term Loan and $125.0 million principal of five-year Notes issued to funds (the \u201cPurchasers\u201d) managed by affiliates of Ares Management LLC (\u201cAres\u201d). In addition, Ares managed funds also acquired 29,408,305 shares of our common stock for $50.0 million cash, and as a result, became our largest stockholder with 15.8% of our outstanding common stock at March 3, 2017. In order to provide funding for the STACK Leasehold Acquisition and a portion of our 2017 capital budget, on March 21, 2017, Ares purchased for cash an additional $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Notes sold at par (the \u201cAdditional Notes\u201d). The Notes, including the Additional Notes, were issued with conversion rights that were subject to the approval of holders of issued and outstanding common stock (other than the Purchasers), which approval was obtained May 2, 2017 (the \u201cRequisite Stockholder Approval\u201d). Pursuant to the purchase agreement for the Additional Notes, upon receipt of Requisite Stockholder Approval, Purchasers and the Company exchanged $37.5 million principal amount of the Additional Notes for (a) 25,456,521 newly issued shares of Common Stock (the \u201cRepurchase Shares\u201d) and (b) 2,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Special Voting Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cMandatory Repurchase\u201d). See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nAres also has the right to designate two directors to serve on our board of directors. The views of Ares as manager of our lenders, or any directors appointed by Ares, may differ from, or conflict with, the rest of our management on matters such as the need to raise capital or the need to waive or amend covenants in the Term Loan or the indenture governing the Notes in order to pursue our business plan or avoid a default under such agreements. In addition, Ares, through its affiliates managing our primary secured lenders, may take actions, or fail to grant waivers or amendments to agreements governing our indebtedness, that may not be consistent with, or may conflict with, the interests of other stockholders.\nIf the counterparties to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use hedges to mitigate our oil and natural gas price risk with counterparties. If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivative instruments, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. We cannot provide assurance that our counterparties will honor their obligations now or in the future. A counterparty\u2019s insolvency or inability or unwillingness to make payments required under terms of derivative instruments with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At the date of filing of this Form 10-K, our counterparties were Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., Cargill, Incorporated, Koch Supply & Trading, LP and NextEra Energy Marketing, LLC.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various significant legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. No assurance can be given regarding the outcome of these legal proceedings. Litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, however, can result in substantial costs and diversion of resources from our business. These costs would be reflected in terms of dollar outlay as well as the amount of time, attention and other resources that our management would have to appropriate to the defense of such claims. Considerable legal, accounting and other professional services expenses have been incurred in legal proceedings to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future. Defense costs and any adverse outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding our legal proceedings, see Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nDeficiencies of title to our leased interests could significantly affect our financial condition.\nOur practice in acquiring exploration leases or undivided interests in oil and natural gas leases is not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest prior to executing the lease. Instead, we rely upon the judgment of lease brokers and others to perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental or county clerk\u2019s office before leasing a specific mineral interest. This practice is widely followed in the industry. Prior to drilling an exploration well, the operator of the well will typically obtain a preliminary title review of the drillsite lease or spacing unit within which the proposed well is to be drilled to identify any obvious deficiencies in title to the well and, if there are deficiencies, to identify measures necessary to cure those defects to the extent reasonably possible. It does happen, from time-to-time, that the examination made by the operator\u2019s title lawyers reveals that the lease or leases are invalid, having been purchased in error from a person who is not the rightful owner of the mineral interest desired. In these circumstances, we may not be able to proceed with our exploration and development of the lease site or may incur costs to remedy a defect, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, development and production interest and operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the operation and maintenance of our facilities, including laws regulating removal of\nnatural resources from the ground, the discharge of materials into the environment and otherwise relating to environmental protection. Oil and natural gas operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations which seek to maintain occupational health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of drilling methods and equipment.\nGovernmental authorities administering these laws and any implementing regulations require various timely permits, including drilling and environmental permits, before conducting regulated activities and we cannot assure you that such permits will be obtained or obtained in a timely manner. The failure or delay in obtaining the requisite permits or other approvals may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these laws and regulations impose numerous obligations and restrictions that are applicable to our interests and operations including:\n\u2022\nDrilling and abandonment bonds or other financial responsibility assurances;\n\u2022\nRestriction on types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment;\n\u2022\nReports concerning operations;\n\u2022\nSpacing of wells;\n\u2022\nLimits or prohibitions on drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;\n\u2022\nThe application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection;\n\u2022\nThe imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations;\n\u2022\nLimitations on access to properties;\n\u2022\nTaxation; and\n\u2022\nOther regulatory controls on operating activities.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies have from time to time imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the flow rate of wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations applicable to our interests and operations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or the performance of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining or limiting some or all of our operations in affected areas, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Legal requirements are sometimes unclear or subject to reinterpretation and may be amended in response to economic or political conditions. As a result, it is hard to predict the ultimate future cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our interests and operations. In addition, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the NAAQS for ozone to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either \u201cattainment/unclassifiable\u201d or \u201cunclassifiable\u201d and is expected to issue attainment or non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed under the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018. States are also expected to issue regulations implementing the NAAQS rule that may be more stringent than the federal standards. In a second example, in response to recent seismic events near belowground disposal wells used for the injection of oil and natural gas-related wastewaters, regulators in some states, including Oklahoma, have imposed more stringent permitting and operating requirements for produced water disposal wells. In Oklahoma, the OCC has implemented a variety of measures including adopting the National Academy of Science\u2019s \u201ctraffic light system,\u201d pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted and, further, evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors. Compliance with these or other new legal requirements could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations such as shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have conducted investigations or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding\nthat \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Additionally, the EPA published final CAA regulations in 2012 and again in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; ; published in June 2016 an effluent limited guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 establishing more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian land. However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM\u2019s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court.\nAlso, from time to time the U.S. Congress considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Oklahoma, where we operate, have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic activities in particular. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate or where we own working interests, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nWe could incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to contamination that occurs as a result of our operations.\nWe may incur significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations or in operations in which we own a working interest as a result of the handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells or the wells in which we own a working interest are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in significant delays or restrictions in acquisition of permits or performance of projects, or more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nThe process of drilling for and producing oil and natural gas involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses, and we may not have enough insurance to cover these risks adequately.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves many operating hazards, such as:\n\u2022\nWell blowouts, fires and explosions;\n\u2022\nSurface craterings and casing collapses;\n\u2022\nRoad collapses;\n\u2022\nUncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil, brine, water or well fluids;\n\u2022\nPipe and cement failures;\n\u2022\nFormations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\nStuck drilling and service tools;\n\u2022\nPipeline or tank ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\nNatural disasters; and\n\u2022\nEnvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, crude oil or produced water spills and unauthorized discharges of brine, toxic gases or well fluids.\nAny of these events could cause substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022\nInjury or death;\n\u2022\nDamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\nDamage to natural resources due to underground migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nPollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nRegulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nSuspension or cancellation of operations; and\n\u2022\nRepair, restoration and remediation costs.\nWe could also be responsible for environmental damage caused by previous owners of property from whom we purchased leases or properties. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. Although we maintain what we believe is appropriate and customary insurance for these risks, the insurance may not be available or sufficient to cover all of these liabilities. If these liabilities are not covered by our insurance, paying them could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties.\nFuture regulations relating to and interpretations of recently enacted U.S. federal income tax legislation may vary from our current interpretation of such legislation and any significant variance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted legislation in Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which made significant changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of business entities. The Tax Act, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, (ii) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, (iii) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, and (iv) limits the deductibility of interest expense and (v) changes the cost recovery rules. The Tax Act is highly complex and subject to interpretation. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on us, and significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur oil and natural gas sales and our related hedging activities expose us to potential regulatory risks.\nThe FTC, the FERC, and the CFTC hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales of oil and natural gas and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Our sales may also be subject to certain reporting and other requirements. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nTo the extent that we enter into transportation contracts with natural gas pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation, we are subject to FERC requirements related to use of such capacity. Any failure on our part to comply with the FERC\u2019s regulations and policies, or with an interstate pipeline\u2019s tariff, could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties.\nThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010 new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was enacted that, in part, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nThe CFTC has proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and trade-execution. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception to such requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for un-cleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from such margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flow.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts, materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivatives contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations, the impact of which is not clear at this time.\nAny of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nClimate change legislation and regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes and GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has , however, adopted rules under authority of the CAA that, among other things, establish permitting reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal pollutant emissions, which reviews could require meeting \"best available control technology\" standards for those emissions. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, including, among other things, onshore producing facilities, which include certain of our operations.\nFederal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published Subpart OOOOa NSPS that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012 and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. In another example, the BLM published a final rule in November 2016 that imposes requirements to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking on federal and Indian lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019. The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court. These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and gas sector could result in increased costs to our operations and similar operations that we do not operate but in which we own a working interest as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally\ndetermined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions.\nHowever, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations, or the equipment and operations of assets in which we own an interest, could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with those operations as well as delays or restrictions in our ability to permit GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce and lower the value of our reserves, which devaluation could be significant. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such physical effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration, development and production interests and operations. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense. We are smaller and have less operating history than many of our competitors, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete with other oil and natural gas companies in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties. Our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, numerous independent oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies that have substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do and, in many instances, have been engaged in the oil and natural gas business for a much longer time than we have. These companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase more properties and prospects than our financial and human resources permit. In addition, these companies may be able to spend more on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to the current and future success of oil and natural gas companies. Our ability to explore for oil and natural gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct our operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. Increased competitive pressure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nTechnological changes could affect our operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services utilizing new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement such new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, many other oil and natural gas companies have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may be unable to respond to such competitive pressures and implement such technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies that we currently use or may implement in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nWe depend on our key personnel, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe depend, to a large extent, on the services of a limited number of senior management personnel and directors. We recently lost the services of our chief executive officer and are commencing are a search for his replacement and as a result, are reliant on a limited number of senior and executive officers. Particularly, the loss of the services of our interim chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief operating officer could negatively impact our future operations. We have employment agreements with our interim chief executive officer and our chief financial officer; although, we do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our senior management. We believe that our success is also dependent on our ability to continue to retain the services of skilled technical personnel and a replacement chief executive\nofficer. Our inability to retain a new chief executive officer or retain other skilled technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nSome of our directors may not be subject to suit in the United States.\nOne of our directors is a citizen of Canada. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon such director, to bring suit against him in the U.S. or to enforce in the U.S. courts any judgment obtained there against him predicated upon any civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Investors should not assume that Canadian courts will enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against such director predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or \u201cblue sky\u201d laws of any state within the United States or will enforce, in original actions, liabilities against those directors upon the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities or blue sky laws.\nSeasonal weather conditions and regulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and regulations designed to protect various wildlife. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. These constraints, the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nOur common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of drilling and rig activity, economic conditions in the natural gas and oil industry, general economic conditions or other events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for oil and natural gas exploration companies, in particular, have experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results or asset values of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against certain oil and natural gas exploration companies. If this type of litigation were instituted against us following a period of volatility in our common stock trading price, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nFuture issuances of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe future issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market, or the perception that such an issuance could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. A decline in the price of our common stock could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred shares and set the terms of the preferred shares without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. The preferred shares that we have issued rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred shares that rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights or voting rights. If we issue additional preferred shares in the future, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have issued in the past, and may in the future continue to issue, in the open market at prevailing prices or in capital markets offerings series of perpetual preferred stock with dividend and liquidation preferences that rank ahead of our common stock.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business. In addition, the indenture under which the Notes were issued and the agreement governing the Term Loan contain covenants that significantly restrict the payment of cash dividends on our outstanding common stock and only limitedly permit the payment of cash dividends on our outstanding preferred stock as long as such debt remains outstanding. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings,\nfinancial condition, capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors. Accordingly, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment, which may not occur.\nIf commodity prices drop, we may be limited or unable to lawfully declare dividends on our capital stock.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) permits payment of dividends out of a corporation\u2019s surplus. Surplus is defined as the excess of net assets over the corporation\u2019s capital as determined under the DGCL. If commodity prices drop, the net value of our assets will decline and, accordingly, we may not have available surplus from which to lawfully pay or declare dividends on our capital stock.", "PERMNO": 91069, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GSTCQ"}
