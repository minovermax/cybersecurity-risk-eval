The occurrence of one or more of these events or circumstances could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the foreseeable future.\nSince we entered the oil and gas business in April 2005 through December 31, 2014, we had incurred an accumulated deficit of $784.5 million. If we fail to eventually generate profits from our operations, we will not be able to sustain our business. We may never report profitable operations or generate sufficient revenue to maintain our Company as a going concern.\nNatural gas and oil prices declined dramatically in the third and fourth quarters of 2014. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe prices we receive for our natural gas and oil production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Natural gas and oil are commodities, and therefore their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for natural gas and oil have been extremely volatile. Recently, natural gas and oil prices have declined dramatically.\nDuring the past five years, the NYMEX price for West Texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as NYMEX-WTI, has ranged from a low of $44.45 per Bbl, in January 2015 to a high of $113.93 per Bbl in April 2011. The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.82 per MMBtu in April 2012 to a high of $7.92 per MMBtu in March 2014. During 2014, NYMEX-WTI prices ranged from $53.27 to $107.26 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $2.75 to $7.92 per MMBtu. On January 30, 2015, the NYMEX-WTI price for crude oil was $48.24 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.68 per MMBtu, representing decreases of 55% and 66%, respectively, from the high of $107.26 per Bbl of oil and $7.92 per MMBtu for natural gas during 2014.\nThese markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our daily production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\ni.\nthe current uncertainty in the global economy;\nii.\nchanges in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\niii.\nthe condition of the U.S. and global economies;\niv.\nthe actions of certain foreign countries;\nv.\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\nvi.\npolitical conditions, including embargoes, war or civil unrest in or affecting other oil producing activities of certain countries;\nvii.\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\nviii.\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\nix.\nproduction or pricing decisions made by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC;\nx.\nweather conditions;\nxi.\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\nxii.\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per-unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically in the future. Higher operating costs associated with any of our oil or natural gas fields will make our profitability more sensitive to oil or natural gas price declines. A sustained decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. In addition, a sustained decline in oil or natural gas prices might result in substantial downward estimates of our proved reserves. Our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan agreement contain financial covenants based on our\nlevels of proved reserves and proved developed and producing reserves. In addition, the borrowing base of our revolving credit facility is based, in part, on our proved reserves. Reductions in our estimated proved reserves could result in our failure to satisfy these reserve coverage ratios, which could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and second lien term loan agreement, and could result in a reduction of our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility.\nDrilling for and producing natural gas and oil are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:\ni.\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\nii.\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\niii.\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\niv.\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\nv.\nequipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;\nvi.\nunexpected operational events and drilling conditions;\nvii.\npipe or cement failures;\nviii.\ncasing collapses;\nix.\nlost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools;\nx.\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\nxi.\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas and fluids;\nxii.\nfires and natural disasters;\nxiii.\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;\nxiv.\nadverse weather conditions;\nxv.\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\nxvi.\nnatural gas and oil property title problems; and\nxvii.\nmarket limitations for natural gas and oil.\nIf any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield natural gas or oil in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospects are in various stages of evaluation and development. There is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield natural gas or oil in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable, particularly in light of the current economic environment. The use of seismic data and other technologies, and the study of producing fields in the same area, will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether natural gas or oil will be present or, if present, whether natural gas or oil gas will be present in commercially viable quantities. Moreover, the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects.\nWe have relatively limited experience in drilling wells in the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations and limited information regarding reserves and decline rates in these areas. Wells drilled to these areas are more expensive and more susceptible to mechanical problems in drilling and completion techniques than wells in conventional areas.\nWe have relatively limited experience in the drilling and completion of Marcellus and Utica Shale formation wells, including relatively limited horizontal drilling and completion experience. Other operators in these plays may have significantly more experience in the drilling and completion of these wells, including the drilling and completion of horizontal wells. In addition, we have limited information with respect to the ultimate recoverable reserves and production decline rates in these areas due to their limited histories. The wells drilled in Marcellus and Utica Shale formations are primarily horizontal and require more artificial stimulation, which makes them more expensive to drill and complete. The wells also are more susceptible to mechanical problems associated with the drilling and completion of the wells, such as casing collapse and lost equipment in the wellbore due to the length of the lateral portions of these unconventional wells. The fracturing of these formations will be more extensive and complicated than fracturing geological formations in conventional areas of operation.\nOur core properties are geographically concentrated, making us disproportionately vulnerable to risks associated with operating in our core areas of operation.\nOur core properties are geographically concentrated. As of January 31, 2015, our core natural gas reserves and operations are primarily located in West Virginia and Ohio. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of events or circumstances in these areas such as regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells caused by governmental regulation, gathering, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, or interruption of the gathering, processing or transportation of natural gas or natural gas liquids.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nEstimates of natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. To prepare our proved reserve estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. As required by SEC rules and regulations, we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions as well as operating and development costs being incurred at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and gas production because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows, standardized measure or PV-10 in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. Actual future net revenues from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\ni.\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\nii.\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\niii.\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\niv.\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this annual report.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exploration and development operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is very capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for, and development, production, gathering, processing and acquisition of, oil and natural gas reserves and production. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from bank borrowings, cash generated by operations, proceeds from non-core asset sales and proceeds from public (including \u201cat-the-market\u201d, or ATM) offerings of our preferred stock, private offerings in 2014 of our common stock, private offerings in 2012 of our senior notes and, to a lesser extent, public (including years-past ATM) offerings of our common stock.\nWe intend to finance our future capital expenditures with a combination of internally-generated cash flow, capital market related funding, anticipated borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from non-core asset sales and potential joint venture or other strategic opportunities. However, our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\ni.\nthe prices at which oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold;\nii.\nour proved reserves;\niii.\nthe amount of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from our wells;\niv.\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\nv.\nour ability to access capital markets at opportune times.\nIf our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. We may need to seek additional financing in the future. The issuance of additional debt may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock. In addition, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, depending on market conditions and restrictions under our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business.\nAs of January 31, 2015, our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately $948.3 million. This indebtedness consisted primarily of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and borrowings under our second lien term loan and our senior notes. Our principal debt facilities are described under the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section of this annual report.\nWe expect to incur additional debt from time to time, and such borrowings may be substantial. Our debt could have material adverse consequences to us, including the following:\ni.\nit may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our credit and other debt agreements, or maintain compliance with financial and other debt covenants;\nii.\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other general corporate purposes may be impaired;\niii.\na significant portion of our cash flow is committed to payments on our debt, which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes, such as future capital expenditures, acquisitions and general working capital;\niv.\nwe are more vulnerable to price fluctuations and to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry is more limited; and\nv.\nour ability to capitalize on business opportunities, and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to others in our industry, may be limited.\nOur failure to service any such debt or to comply with the applicable financial and other debt covenants could result in a default under the related debt agreement, and under any other debt agreement or any commodity derivative contract under which such default is a cross-default, which could result in the acceleration of the payment of such debt, termination of the lenders' commitments to make further loans to us, loss of our ownership interests in the secured properties, early termination of the commodity derivative contract (and an early termination payment obligation) and/or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDowngrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn January 16, 2015, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services lowered our corporate credit rating from B- to CCC+, lowered its rating on our second lien term loan from B to B- and lowered its rating on our senior unsecured debt from CCC to CCC-, with negative outlook. The downgrade in these ratings was due in part to our current liquidity position and Standard & Poor\u2019s revised pricing assumptions for oil and natural gas. Our credit ratings could be lowered further if our liquidity position worsens or if prices of natural gas and oil continue at their currently depressed levels or further decline. Reduced credit ratings could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to raise additional capital in the capital markets and could also make it more difficult for us to negotiate reasonable terms with our vendors and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and our results of operations and financial position.\nRestrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility, second lien credit agreement, and the indenture governing our senior notes may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, or to engage in, expand or pursue our business strategies.\nThe credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility, the second lien credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to, with certain exceptions:\ni.\nincur indebtedness and issue preferred stock;\nii.\ngrant liens on our assets;\niii.\nmake certain restricted payments, including payment of dividends on our outstanding common and preferred stock;\niv.\nchange the nature of our business;\nv.\nacquire or make expenditures for oil and gas properties outside of the U.S. and Canada;\nvi.\nacquire certain assets or businesses or make certain asset sales;\nvii.\ndispose of all or substantially all our assets or enter into mergers, consolidations or similar transactions;\nviii.\nmake investments, loans or advances;\nix.\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\nx.\ncreate new subsidiaries; and\nxi.\nenter into certain derivatives transactions.\nThe credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including maintaining:\ni.\ncommencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2015, a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility) of not less than (a) 0.75 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2015 and (b) 1.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2015 and for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter;\nii.\na leverage ratio (secured net debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility) with, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016, a limitation on netting of up to $100,000,000 of\nunencumbered cash) of not more than (a) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014, (b) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2015 and (c) 2.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending thereafter; and\niii.\na ratio of proved reserves to secured debt of not less than 1.5 to 1.0 (the \u201cProved Reserves Coverage Ratio\u201d) and a ratio of proved developed and producing reserves to secured debt of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 (the \u201cPDP Reserves Coverage Ratio\u201d), each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014.\nThe second lien credit agreement also requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including maintaining:\ni.\nthe Proved Reserves Coverage Ratio and PDP Reserves Coverage Ratio described above; and\nii.\ncommencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016, a leverage ratio (secured net debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the second lien credit agreement) with a limitation on netting of up to $100,000,000 of unencumbered cash) of not more than 2.5 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the trailing four-quarter period then ended.\nOur compliance with these provisions may affect our ability to react to changes in market or industry conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures for exploration and development, finance acquisitions, equipment purchases and other expenditures, or withstand a future downturn in our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or reduce our expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financings could be obtained or, if obtainable or obtained, would be on terms acceptable or favorable to us. If market, industry or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired.\nOur principal debt agreements are described under the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section of this annual report.\nOur failure to timely file certain periodic reports with the SEC in the future would limit our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital.\nDuring 2013, we did not file within the time frames required by the SEC our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 and certain pro forma financial information regarding our April 2013 Eagle Ford Shale properties sale (as part of the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on April 30, 2013 reporting the sale). We became current with our SEC reporting obligations on July 12, 2013; however, until twelve months after the date on which we became current, we were ineligible to use abbreviated and less costly SEC filings.\nWe have now timely filed all our required SEC reports for a period of twelve months, and we are now eligible to use abbreviated and less costly SEC filings to register our securities for sale. However, additional late SEC filings would limit our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that would be beneficial to our business.\nIn addition, we anticipate that the filing of this annual report will render us unable to use our currently effective universal shelf Form S-3 registration statement as we expect that, on the date of filing of this report, the Company will no longer meet the criteria of a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer under which the Form S-3 registration statement was originally filed as an automatic shelf registration statement. Accordingly, we are preparing to file a post-effective amendment to the existing registration statement to convert it to a non-automatic shelf registration statement to enable us to issue securities from time to time, including issuances of common stock, in ATM offerings. We plan to file the post-effective amendment to the registration statement during the first quarter of 2015. However, the post-effective amendment must be declared effective by the SEC and may be subject to review by the SEC, which review could delay our ability to raise debt or equity capital under the registration statement, and thus adversely affect access to financing at a time when such financing may be critical to our business.\nA pending SEC investigation and pending securities litigation may divert the attention of management and other important resources, may expose us to negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs further described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings,\u201d on April 26, 2013, we were advised by the staff of the SEC Enforcement Division that the SEC had commenced an inquiry into matters disclosed in certain of our SEC filings and press releases, as well as the\nsufficiency of our internal controls and our decisions to change auditors from Hein & Associates LLP to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, (\u201cPwC\u201d), and from PwC to BDO USA, LLP, among other matters. This investigation is ongoing and we are cooperating with the SEC in connection with these matters. We may incur significant professional fees and other costs in responding to the SEC investigation. If the SEC were to conclude that enforcement action is appropriate, we could be required to pay substantial civil penalties and fines. The SEC also could impose other sanctions against us or certain of our current and/or former directors and officers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, there is a risk that we may have to restate our historical consolidated financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC or take other actions not currently contemplated in connection with the SEC investigation.\nAs also further described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings,\u201d in late 2013, certain class action cases that remained outstanding against the Company were consolidated (the \u201cSecurities Case\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints in the Securities Case alleged that the Company made certain false or misleading statements in its filings with the SEC, including statements related to the Company\u2019s internal and financial controls, the calculation of non-cash share-based compensation expense, the late filing of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 (which was filed by the Company with the SEC in June 2013), the dismissal of the Company\u2019s previous independent registered accounting firm, and other matters. The complaints demanded that the defendants pay unspecified damages to the class action plaintiffs, including damages allegedly caused by the decline in the Company\u2019s stock price between February 22, 2013 and April 22, 2013.\nOn June 23, 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an opinion and order granting the Company\u2019s and the individual defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Securities Case and, accordingly, the Securities Case has now been dismissed. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs defending the Securities Case. Depending on the outcome of the appeal, we could be required to pay one or more settlements or judgments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, as further described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings,\u201d we have one remaining stockholder derivative case outstanding. On March 19, 2014, Richard Harveth filed a stockholder derivative suit in the 125th District Court of Harris County, Texas on behalf of the Company against the Company\u2019s directors and senior officers. This suit is referred to as the Derivative Case. The Derivative Case generally asserts that the individual defendants unjustly enriched themselves and breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by publishing allegedly false and misleading statements to the Company's investors regarding the Company's business and financial position and results, and allegedly failing to maintain adequate internal controls. The complaint demands that the defendants pay unspecified damages to the Company, including damages allegedly sustained by the Company as a result of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the defendants, as well as disgorgement of profits and benefits obtained by the defendants, and reasonable attorneys', accountants' and experts' fees and costs to the plaintiff. The Company is presently seeking dismissal of the Derivative Case.\nOur indemnification obligations and limitations of our directors' and officers' liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our directors and officers with respect to current and future investigations and litigation, including the matters discussed in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d In connection with some of these pending matters, we are required to, or we have otherwise agreed to, advance legal fees and related expenses to certain of our directors and officers and expect to do so while these matters are pending. Certain of these obligations may not be \u201ccovered matters\u201d under our directors' and officers' liability insurance, or there may be insufficient coverage available. Further, in the event the directors and officers are ultimately determined to not be entitled to indemnification, we may be unable to recover any amounts we previously advanced to them.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that the above-described pending claims, or claims yet to arise, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims. The insurers also may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters. Furthermore, the insurers could become insolvent and be unable to fulfill their obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us for insured claims. Due to these coverage limitations, we may incur significant unreimbursed costs, including costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, our board of directors, management and employees may spend a substantial amount of time on the pending litigation, diverting a significant amount of resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs a result of the outstanding SEC investigation, the Securities Case and the Derivative Case (and the other shareholder derivative cases that have been dismissed), we have been the subject of negative publicity. We believe this negative publicity has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our stock price and may harm our reputation and our relationships with current and future investors, lenders, customers, suppliers, business partners and employees. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nA prolonged credit crisis would likely materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot predict.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long-term or short-term debt or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing. A prolonged credit crisis, such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and related turmoil in the global financial system would likely materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. The economic situation could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection.\nFuture economic conditions in the United States and global markets may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.\nThe United States and other world economies are slowly recovering from the economic recession that began in 2008. While economic growth has resumed, it remains modest and the timing of an economic recovery is uncertain. There are likely to be significant long-term effects resulting from the recession and credit market crisis, including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than what was experienced in the years preceding the recession. Economic production and business and consumer confidence levels have not yet fully recovered to pre-recession levels. In addition, more volatility may occur before a sustainable, yet lower, growth rate is achieved. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including for oil and natural gas. A lower future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which will reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.\nIf our access to natural gas and oil markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases. Our ability to sell natural gas and/or receive market prices for our natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline gathering and transportation system capacity constraints.\nMarket conditions or the restriction in the availability of satisfactory natural gas and oil transportation arrangements may hinder our access to natural gas and oil markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of natural gas and oil and the proximity of reserves to transportation infrastructure. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of pipeline gathering and transportation systems, processing facilities, terminals and rail and truck transportation owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. Our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our natural gas or oil may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production.\nThe amount of natural gas and oil being produced by us and others could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in these areas. If this occurs, it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Because of the current economic climate, certain pipeline projects that are or may be planned for the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale areas may not occur for lack of financing. In addition, capital constraints could limit the ability to build or expand gathering systems, such as the Eureka Hunter Gas Gathering System, necessary to gather our gas to deliver to interstate pipelines. In such event, we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project for these specific regions, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of purchasers for a substantial portion of our revenue. The inability of one or more of our purchasers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a relatively small number of purchasers of our production. Our inability to continue to provide services to key customers, if not offset by additional sales to our other customers, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These companies may not provide the same level of our revenue in the future for a variety of reasons, including their lack of funding, a strategic shift on their part in moving to different geographic areas in which we do not operate or our failure to meet their performance criteria. The loss of all or a significant part of this revenue would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages of equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, pipeline operators, oil and natural gas marketers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices and activity levels in certain regions where we are active, causing periodic shortages. During periods of high oil and gas prices, we have experienced shortages of equipment, including drilling rigs and completion equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with higher commodity prices and increased activity levels. In addition, there is currently a shortage of hydraulic fracturing and wastewater disposal capacity in many of the areas in which we operate. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, pipe and other midstream services equipment and qualified personnel in exploration, production and midstream operations. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill wells, construct gathering pipelines and conduct other operations that we currently have planned or budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nWe are dependent upon contractor, consultant and partnering arrangements.\nWe had a total of approximately 440 full-time employees as of December 31, 2014. Despite this number of employees, we expect that we will continue to require the services of independent contractors and consultants to perform various services, including professional services such as reservoir engineering, land, legal, environmental, accounting and tax services. We will also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation and leasing. Our dependence on contractors, consultants and third-party service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed, and the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects.\nIf we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may suffer if we lose key personnel.\nOur operations depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers, including specifically Gary C. Evans, our chairman and chief executive officer, and other senior management. Our business or prospects could be adversely affected if any of these persons do not continue in their management role with us and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements. Additionally, we do not presently carry key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or senior management.\nWe cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and so are unable to control their proper operation and profitability.\nWe do not operate all the properties in which we have an ownership interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operations of these non-operated properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production, revenues and reserves. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\ni.\nthe nature and timing of the operator\u2019s drilling and other activities;\nii.\nthe timing and amount of required capital expenditures;\niii.\nthe operator\u2019s geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;\niv.\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\nv.\nthe operator\u2019s selection of suitable technology.\nCompetition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, exploiting mineral leases, marketing natural gas and oil, treating and gathering third-party natural gas production and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects and establish and maintain more diversified and expansive midstream services than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in an efficient manner even in a highly competitive environment. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, offering midstream services, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.\nThe use of geoscience, petro-physical and engineering analyses and other technical or operating data to evaluate drilling prospects is uncertain and does not guarantee drilling success or recovery of economically producible reserves.\nOur decisions to explore, develop and acquire prospects or properties targeting the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale depend on data obtained through geoscientific, petro-physical and engineering analyses, the results of which can be uncertain. Even when properly used and interpreted, data from whole cores, regional well log analyses and 2-D and 3-D seismic only assist our technical team in identifying hydrocarbon indicators and subsurface structures and estimating hydrocarbons in place. They do not allow us to know conclusively the amount of hydrocarbons in place and if those hydrocarbons are producible economically. In addition, the use of advanced drilling and completion technologies for the development of our unconventional resources, such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracture stimulations, requires greater expenditures than traditional development drilling strategies. Our ability to commercially recover and produce the hydrocarbons that we believe are in place and attributable to our properties will depend on the effective use of advanced drilling and completion techniques, the scope of our drilling program (which will be directly affected by the availability of capital), drilling and production costs, availability of drilling and completion services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, regulatory approval and geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. Our estimates of unproved reserves, estimated ultimate recoveries per well, hydrocarbons in place and resource potential may change significantly as development of our oil and gas assets provides additional data.\nWe rely on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we use information technology to maintain, analyze and process, to varying degrees, our property information, reserve data, operating records (including amounts paid or payable to suppliers, working interest owners, royalty holders and others), drilling partnership records (including amounts paid or payable to limited partners and others), gas gathering, processing and transmission records, oil and gas marketing records and general accounting, legal, tax, corporate and similar records. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if our information technology resources fail or are compromised or damaged, whether due to a virus, intentional penetration or disruption by a third party, hardware or software corruption or failure or error, service provider error or failure, natural disaster, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other causes. A significant disruption in the functioning of these resources could adversely impact our ability to access, analyze and process information, conduct operations in a normal and efficient manner and timely and accurately manage our accounts receivable and accounts payable, among other business processes, which could disrupt our operations, adversely affect our reputation and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. The release of confidential business information also may subject us to liability, which could expose us to significant expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial results, stock price and reputation. Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays, cessations of service or errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions, result in increased expenses and divert the attention of management and key information technology resources.\nNew technologies may cause our current exploration, development and drilling methods to become obsolete.\nThe natural gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. One or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technologies on a timely basis or at\na cost that is acceptable to us. If we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations, and we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks that we may ultimately face.\nWe maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses to protect against the risks we foresee. For example, we maintain (i) comprehensive general liability insurance, (ii) employer\u2019s liability and workers' compensation insurance, (iii) automobile liability insurance, (iv) environmental insurance, (v) property insurance, (vi) directors' and officers' insurance, (vii) control of well insurance, (viii) pollution insurance and (ix) umbrella/excess liability insurance. We do not carry business interruption insurance. We may elect not to carry, or may cease to carry, certain types or amounts of insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, it is not possible to insure fully against pollution and environmental risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and under insured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\ni.\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\nii.\nabnormally pressured formations;\niii.\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses;\niv.\nfires and explosions;\nv.\npersonal injuries and death; and\nvi.\nnatural disasters.\nEureka Hunter Pipeline\u2019s midstream activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with constructing, operating and maintaining pipelines and related equipment and natural gas treating equipment, including the possibility of pipeline leaks, breaks and ruptures, pipeline damage due to natural hazards, such as ground movement and weather, equipment failures, explosions, fires, accidents and personal injuries and death.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then that accident or other event could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.\nWe purchase and acquire from third parties or directly from the mineral fee owners certain oil and gas leasehold interests and other real property interests upon which we will perform our drilling and exploration activities. The existence of a title deficiency can significantly devalue an acquired interest or render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we generally rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or internal or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest and before drilling a well on a leased tract. The failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nProduct price derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently and will likely continue to enter into derivative contracts to economically hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production. Derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\ni.\nproduction is less than expected;\nii.\nthe counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations; or\niii.\nthere is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received.\nIn addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. Under the terms of our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan, the percentage of our total production volumes with respect to which we are allowed to enter into derivative contracts is limited, and we therefore retain the risk of a price decrease for our remaining production volumes. Also, our failure to service our debt or to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under the applicable debt agreement, and therefore a default under any of our derivative contracts under which such debt default is a cross-default, could result in the early termination of the derivative contracts (and early termination payment obligations) and/or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the prices of natural gas and oil continue at current levels or further decline, we will not be able to hedge future production at the same level as our current derivative contracts and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nInformation as to our derivatives activities is set forth under \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Derivative Instruments and Commodity Derivative Activities\u201d, \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d, and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWrite-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties could occur if oil and gas prices remain depressed or decline further or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results. Because our properties currently serve, and will likely continue to serve, as collateral for advances under our existing and future credit facilities, a write-down in the carrying values of our properties could require us to repay debt earlier than we would otherwise be required. It is likely that the cumulative effect of a write-down could also negatively impact the value of our securities, including our common and preferred stock and our senior notes.\nWe account for our crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, developmental dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Future wells are drilled that target geological structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature. A subsequent allocation of costs is then required to properly account for the results. The evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties. If capitalized costs exceed future cash flows, we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair value. Any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities, but will reduce our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity. When evaluating our properties, we are required to test for potential write-downs at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets, which is typically on a field by field basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized $118.5 million in exploration expense, which includes leasehold impairment and expiration expense related to leases in the Williston and Appalachian Basin regions. Additionally, we recorded proved impairments of $301.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due primarily to the dramatic reduction in prices for oil and gas as well as changes in production estimates and lease operating costs indicating potential impairment of our Williston and Appalachian Basin proved properties, and the resulting provision for reduction to the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values.\nWe review our oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices subsequently increase. Given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets, prices could remain depressed or decline further or other events may arise that would require us to record further impairments of the book values associated with oil and gas properties. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will be required to further write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would reduce our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThere are restrictive covenants, governance and other provisions in the New LLC Agreement that may restrict the ability of Eureka Hunter Holdings to pursue its business strategies and our ability to exert influence over and manage the business and operations of Eureka Hunter Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nWe are involved in midstream operations through our substantial equity investment in Eureka Hunter Holdings. The New LLC Agreement contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Eureka Hunter Holdings and its subsidiaries to, with certain exceptions:\ni.\nissue additional equity interests;\nii.\npay distributions to its owners, or repurchase or redeem any of its equity securities;\niii.\nincur indebtedness;\niv.\nmodify, amend or terminate material contracts;\nv.\nmake any material acquisitions, dispositions or divestitures; or\nvi.\nenter into a sale, merger, consolidation or other change of control transaction.\nFurther, pursuant to the terms of the New LLC Agreement, the number and composition of the board of managers of Eureka Hunter Holdings may change over time based on MSI\u2019s percentage ownership interest in Eureka Hunter Holdings, or the failure of Eureka Hunter Holdings to satisfy certain performance standards on and after December 31, 2018. Currently, the board of managers of Eureka Hunter Holdings is composed of six members, three of whom are designated by us and three of whom are designated by MSI. Any decrease in the proportion of members that we are entitled to designate to the board of managers of Eureka Hunter Holdings will adversely affect our ability to exert influence over and manage the business and operations of Eureka Hunter Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nThe New LLC Agreement also allows MSI, as the holder of the Series A-2 Units, to initiate a \u201cQualified Public Offering\u201d of securities of Eureka Hunter Holdings at any time, so long as MSI holds at least a 20% of the total Class A Common Units in Eureka Hunter Holdings. A Qualified Public Offering means an underwritten initial public offering of securities of Eureka Hunter Holdings for which aggregate cash proceeds to be received by Eureka Hunter Holdings from such offering are at least $25 million and which results in equity securities of Eureka Hunter Holdings being listed on a national securities exchange.\nThe New LLC Agreement also contains transfer restrictions on Magnum Hunter\u2019s ownership interests in Eureka Hunter Holdings (subject to certain exceptions) and certain \u201cdrag-along\u201d and \u201ctag-along\u201d rights in favor of MSI.\nThese restrictive covenants, governance and other provisions may restrict the ability of Eureka Hunter Holdings to pursue its business strategies and our ability to exert influence over and manage the business and operations of Eureka Hunter Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nNGAS conducted part of its operations through private drilling partnerships, and, following our acquisition of NGAS in April 2011, we sponsored two private drilling partnerships, which subject us to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nNGAS conducted a portion of its operations through private drilling partnerships with third parties. Following our acquisition of NGAS, we, as sponsor, completed two private drilling partnerships. Under our partnership structure, proceeds from the private placement of interests in each investment partnership, together with the sponsor\u2019s capital contribution, are contributed to a separate joint venture or \u201cprogram\u201d that the sponsor forms with that partnership to conduct drilling or property operations. These NGAS historical drilling partnerships and our sponsored drilling partnerships expose us to additional risks that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. These additional risks include risks relating to regulatory requirements relating to the sale of interests in the investment partnerships, risks relating to potential challenges to tax positions taken by the investment partnerships, risks relating to disagreements with partners in the investment partnerships and risks relating to our general liability , in our capacity as general partner of the investment partnerships and program partnerships.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental laws, which could adversely affect our business.\nExploration for and development, exploitation, production, processing, gathering, transportation and sale of oil and natural gas in the United States are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including complex tax laws and environmental laws and regulations. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws, regulations or incremental taxes and fees, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations.\nMatters subject to regulation include oil and gas production and saltwater disposal operations and our processing, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials, discharge permits for drilling operations, spacing of wells, environmental protection and taxation. We could incur significant costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental or other laws, including third-party claims for personal injuries and property damage, reclamation costs, remediation and clean-up costs resulting from oil spills and pipeline leaks and ruptures and discharges of hazardous materials, fines and sanctions, and other environmental damages.\nPursuant to the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States, including wetlands. The term \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d has been broadly defined to include certain inland water bodies, including certain wetlands and intermittent streams. On April 21, 2014, the EPA proposed a new definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that, if finalized, would tend to broaden rather than narrow the scope. As a result of a settlement reached in 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on whether to list numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act over the next several years. The final designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities.\nThe Eureka Hunter Gas Gathering System and the expected future expansion of these operations by Eureka Hunter Pipeline are subject to additional governmental regulations.\nEureka Hunter Pipeline is currently continuing the construction of the Eureka Hunter Gas Gathering System, which provides or is expected to provide gas gathering services primarily in support of our Company-owned properties as well as other upstream producers\u2019 operations in West Virginia and Ohio. Eureka Hunter Pipeline has completed certain sections of the pipeline and anticipates further expansion of the pipeline in the future, which expansion will be determined by various factors, including the prospects for commitments for gathering services from third-party producers, the availability of gas processing facilities, obtainment of rights-of-way, securing regulatory and governmental approvals, resolving any land management issues, completion of pipeline construction and connecting the pipeline to the producing sources of natural gas.\nThe construction, operation and maintenance of the Eureka Hunter Gas Gathering System involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond the control of Eureka Hunter Pipeline and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. There can be no assurance that pipeline construction projects will be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost, or at all. The Eureka Hunter Gas Gathering System is also subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Eureka Hunter Pipeline\u2019s business activities in many ways, including restricting the manner in which substances are disposed, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination, and requiring capital expenditures to comply with control requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances and wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, there exists the possibility that landowners and other third parties will file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of substances or wastes into the environment.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Eureka Hunter Pipeline\u2019s business due to its handling of natural gas and other petroleum products, air emissions related to operations, historical industry operations including releases of substances into the environment and waste disposal practices. For example, an accidental release from the Eureka Hunter Gas Gathering System could subject Eureka Hunter Pipeline to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Eureka Hunter Pipeline may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s budget proposals for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 include proposals that would, among other things, eliminate or reduce certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nIt is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective and whether such changes may apply retroactively. Although we are unable to predict whether any of these or other proposals will ultimately be enacted, the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $710 million that expire in varying amounts through 2034. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net tax asset because we do not believe the net operating loss carry-forwards are realizable as of December 31, 2014. In addition, changes in the ownership of our stock (including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Internal Revenue Code, which may significantly limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carry-forwards. To the extent an ownership change has occurred or were to occur in the future, it is possible that the limitations imposed on our ability to use pre-ownership change losses could cause a significant net increase in our U.S. federal income tax liability and could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Operations related to well stimulation, including hydraulic fracturing, are typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In guidance released in 2014, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel. In addition, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process is periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress, but has never passed. On May 9, 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Several states, including Texas, have implemented, new regulations pertaining to hydraulic fracturing, including requirement to disclose chemicals used in connection therewith. For example, Texas recently enacted a law that requires hydraulic fracturing operators to disclose the chemicals used in the fracturing process on a well-by-well basis. Further, various municipalities in several states, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, have passed ordinances which seek to prohibit hydraulic fracturing. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with final results expected to be released in 2016. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards in 2015. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a revised proposed rule on May 24, 2013 that would update existing regulation for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. BLM is expected to release a final rule in 2015.\nIn April 2012, the EPA issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds, or VOC, emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air. The EPA also issued regulations that establish standards for VOC emissions from several types of equipment at natural gas well sites, including storage tanks, compressors,\ndehydrators and pneumatic controllers, as well as natural gas gathering and boosting stations, processing plants, and compressor stations. In March 2013, the EPA proposed updates to these VOC performance standards to clarify the requirements for storage tanks used in crude oil and natural gas production. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in VOCs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. On January 14, 2015, the White House announced a goal to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45% from 2012 emission levels by 2025. That same day and in support of the effort, EPA announced that it will release a proposed rule in the summer of 2015 that will directly regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.\nTo our knowledge, there has been no contamination of potable drinking water, or citations or lawsuits claiming such contamination, arising from our hydraulic fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that we produce.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic conditions. Based on these findings, in 2010 the EPA adopted two sets of regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, including one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that requires certain construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. The stationary source final rule addresses the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit programs, pursuant to which these permit programs have been \u201ctailored\u201d to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting. Those regulations were challenged in federal court. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gas emissions alone cannot trigger an obligation to obtain an air permit. However, the Supreme Court upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate GHG emissions from stationary sources, concluding sources that trigger air permitting requirements based on their traditional criteria pollutant emissions must include a limit for greenhouse gases in their permit. On June 2, 2014 the EPA unveiled proposed regulations to limit GHG emissions from existing power plants. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain sources, including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. We are evaluating whether GHG emissions from our operations are subject to the GHG emissions reporting rule and expect to be able to comply with any applicable reporting obligations.\nIn early 2014, President Obama announced the \u201cClimate Action Plan,\u201d a broad-based plan designed to cut carbon pollution. A major focus of that plan is methane emission reductions. In April 2014, the EPA announced that it was seeking input on how to best obtain additional methane reductions from potentially significant sources of methane and VOCs in the upstream oil and gas sector. The EPA released five technical white papers covering emissions from specific oil and gas sources and outlining potential mitigation techniques. The EPA has indicated that it plans to use the white papers to determine whether new regulations are needed to obtain additional reductions in emissions from these sources.\nAlso, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states already have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant added costs to reduce emissions of GHGs or could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce.\nFinally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate change that could have significant physical effect, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nWe must obtain governmental permits and approvals for our operations, which can be a costly and time consuming process, which may result in delays and restrictions on our operations.\nRegulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of specific permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration, development or production operations or our midstream operations. For example, we are often required to prepare and present to federal, state, local or foreign authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or development or production of oil or natural gas, pipeline construction, natural gas compression, treating or processing facilities or equipment and other associated equipment may have on the environment. Further, the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting\nprocess, including through intervention in the courts. Accordingly, the permits we need may not be issued, or if issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably.\nOur operations expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing human health and safety aspects of our operations, the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or midstream construction activities commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling or pipeline construction activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or injunctive relief. Under existing environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from our operations, or our operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion, water management activities, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nDerivatives reform could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d), which was enacted in 2010, established a framework for the comprehensive regulation of the derivatives markets, including the swaps markets. Since the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), and the SEC have adopted regulations to implement this new regulatory regime, and continue to propose and adopt regulations, with the phase-in likely to continue for at least the next year. Among other things, entities that enter into derivatives will be subject to position limits for certain futures, options and swaps (under a pending regulatory proposal), and are currently subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements. There are also possible credit support requirements stemming from regulations that have not yet been finalized in their entirety. Although Dodd-Frank favors mandatory exchange trading and clearing, entities that enter into over-the-counter swaps to mitigate commercial risk, such as Magnum Hunter, may be exempt from the clearing mandate where their positions qualify for exemption under existing CFTC regulations. Whether we are required to post collateral with respect to our derivative transactions will depend on our counterparty type, final rules to be adopted by the CFTC, SEC and the bank regulators, and how our activities fit within those rules. While rules proposed by the CFTC and federal banking regulators would allow for non-cash collateral and exemptions from margin for non-financial companies using swaps to hedge risk, the rules are not final and therefore some uncertainty remains. Many entities, including our counterparties, are now subject to significantly increased regulatory oversight which is expected to include, under regulations that are not yet final, minimum capital requirements. These changes could materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we are required to post cash or other collateral with respect to our derivative positions, we could be required to divert resources (including cash) away from our core businesses, which could limit our ability to execute strategic hedges and thereby result in increased commodity price uncertainty and volatility in our cash flow. Although it is difficult to predict the aggregate effect of this regulatory regime once it is entirely in place, the new regime could increase our costs, limit our ability to protect against risks and reduce liquidity, all of which could impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nAny acquisitions we pursue present risks.\nOur growth has been attributable in part to acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage, either directly as asset acquisitions or indirectly through the acquisition of companies. We expect to continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities on terms we consider favorable. However, we cannot assure you that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms. In addition, we compete against other companies for acquisitions, and we cannot assure you that we will successfully acquire any material property interests. Further, we cannot assure you that future acquisitions by us will be integrated successfully into our operations or will be profitable.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage requires an assessment of numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\ni.\nestimated recoverable reserves;\nii.\nexploration and development potential;\niii.\nfuture oil and natural gas prices;\niv.\noperating costs; and\nv.\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nIn connection with such an assessment, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. The resulting assessments are inexact and their accuracy uncertain, and such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it necessarily permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies within the time frame required to complete the transactions. Inspections may not always be performed on every well or of every property, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is made.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may be substantially different in operating and geologic characteristics, geographic location or regulatory environment than our existing properties. While our core current operations are primarily focused in the West Virginia and Ohio regions, we may pursue acquisitions of properties located in other geographic areas.\nAcquisitions may not be successful, may substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and may create integration difficulties.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire businesses or assets we believe complement our existing core operations and business plans. We may not be able to successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations or achieve the desired profitability from such acquisitions. These acquisitions may require substantial capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional indebtedness which may change significantly our capitalization and results of operations. Further, these acquisitions could result in:\ni.\npost-closing discovery of material undisclosed liabilities of the acquired business or assets, title or other defects with respect to acquired assets, discrepancies or errors in furnished financial statements or other information or breaches of representations made by the sellers;\nii.\nthe unexpected loss of key employees or customers from acquired businesses;\niii.\ndifficulties resulting from our integration of the operations, systems and management of the acquired business; and\niv.\nan unexpected diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other operations.\nIf acquisitions are unsuccessful or result in unanticipated events, such as the post-closing discovery of the matters described above, or if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations, such acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nThere are risks in connection with dispositions we have made and intend to pursue.\nWe have made and continue to pursue dispositions of assets and properties, both to increase our cash position (or reduce our indebtedness) and to redirect our resources toward our core operations or for other purposes, either through asset sales or the sale of stock of one or more of our subsidiaries. We continue to pursue dispositions of non-core assets. However, we cannot assure you that suitable disposition opportunities will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to complete such dispositions on favorable terms. Further, we cannot assure you that our use of the net proceeds from such dispositions will result in improved results of operations.\nAs with a successful acquisition, the successful disposition of assets and properties requires an assessment of numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\ni.\nestimated recoverable reserves;\nii.\nexploration and development potential;\niii.\nfuture oil and natural gas prices;\niv.\noperating costs;\nv.\npotential seller indemnification obligations;\nvi.\nthe creditworthiness of the buyer; and\nvii.\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nIn connection with such an assessment, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. The resulting assessments are inexact and their accuracy uncertain, and such a review may not reveal all existing or potential benefits associated with a property, nor will it necessarily permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies within the time frame required to complete the transactions. Additionally, significant dispositions can change the nature of our operations and business.\nRisks Related to Our Common and Preferred Stock\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since it first became listed on a national securities exchange in August 2006 and may fluctuate substantially in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol \u201cMHR\u201d. On February 23, 2015, the last reported sale price of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, was $2.66 per share. Recently, the price of our common stock has declined substantially. This decline correlates, in part, to the overall recent decline in natural gas and oil prices. The price of our common stock may be subject to further downward pressure if the prices of natural gas and oil continue at current levels or further decline.\nOverall, the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since it first became listed on a national securities exchange in August 2006. From August 30, 2006 to December 31, 2014, the trading price at the close of the market (initially the American Stock Exchange and now the NYSE) of our common stock ranged from a low of $0.20 per share to a high of $9.27 per share. In addition, the stock market in general, and early stage public companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies.\nWe expect our common stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\ni.\nchanges in oil and natural gas prices;\nii.\nvariations in quarterly drilling, production and operating results;\niii.\nacquisitions and dispositions of assets;\niv.\nresults of our midstream operations;\nv.\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\nvi.\nchanges in market valuations of comparable companies;\nvii.\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nviii.\nthe level of our overall indebtedness;\nix.\nfuture issuances of our common stock and related dilution to existing stockholders;\nx.\nlegal or regulatory proceedings or the threat thereof; and\nxi.\nthe other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this annual report.\nWe may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future, and our stock price could decline as a result. Volatility or depressed market prices of our common stock could make it difficult for our stockholders to resell shares of our common stock when they want or at attractive prices.\nThe market for our common stock may not provide investors with sufficient liquidity or a market-based valuation of our common stock.\nThe volume of trading in our common stock may not always provide investors sufficient liquidity in the event they wish to sell large blocks of common stock. There can be no assurance that an active market for our common stock will be available for trading in large volumes. If we are unable to maintain or further develop an active market for our common stock, our stockholders may not be able to sell our common stock at prices they consider to be fair or at times that are convenient for them, or at all.\nWe will likely issue additional common stock in the future, which would dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders.\nIn the future we may issue additional securities up to our total authorized and unissued amounts, including shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders. We are currently authorized under our certificate of incorporation to issue up to 350,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, preferences and rights as may be determined by our board of directors.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were 200,505,749 shares of our common stock outstanding, 4,000,000 shares of our non-convertible Series C Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, or Series C Preferred Stock, outstanding, 4,424,889 shares of our non-convertible Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, or Series D Preferred Stock, outstanding and 3,721,556 Depositary Shares representing 3,722 shares of our Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, or Series E Preferred Stock, outstanding.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining personnel, option or warrant exercises, future acquisitions or future placements of our securities for capital-raising or other business purposes.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and Delaware law, contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors and our executive officers, who collectively beneficially owned approximately 5.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of February 23, 2015.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us and changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\ni.\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval;\nii.\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws without stockholder approval;\niii.\nthe requirement for advance notice of director nominations to our board of directors and for proposing other matters to be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\niv.\nrequiring that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chairman, by a majority of our board of directors, by our chief executive officer or by stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at such meeting; and\nv.\nallowing our directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on the board of directors, including vacancies resulting from removal of directors or enlargement of the board of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us.\nAs of February 23, 2015, our board of directors and executive officers collectively beneficially owned approximately 5.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Although this is not a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, these stockholders, acting together, may have the ability to exert influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and certain other corporate matters and transactions.\nThe provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law, and any concentrated ownership of our common stock by our directors and executive officers, could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to appreciation in the market value of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our businesses. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and investment opportunities. In addition, our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes limit the payment of dividends on our stock under certain circumstances without the prior written consent of the lenders or note holders. Accordingly, stockholders\nmust look solely to appreciation in the market value of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment, which appreciation in value may never occur or may occur only from time to time and then only for limited periods of time.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our common stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend rights, liquidation rights and/or voting rights. The terms of such preferred stock may also require us to redeem the preferred stock at the option of the holders of the preferred stock or mandatorily at certain times or under certain circumstances. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur assets are subject to liquidation preferences in favor of the holders of our preferred stock, which will impact the rights of holders of our common stock if we liquidate.\nWe have a significant number of shares outstanding of each of our Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares representing our Series E Preferred Stock. Under the certificates of designations of these series of preferred stock, if we liquidate, holders of our preferred stock (including the holders of the Depositary Shares) are entitled to receive payment of the stated liquidation preference of their shares, together with any accrued but unpaid dividends, before any payment is made to holders of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on our preferred stock in the future.\nOur Series C Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, and Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock currently accrue dividends at annual rates of 10.25%, 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility, the second lien credit agreement, and the indenture governing our senior notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain payments, including the payment of dividends on our preferred stock if there is an event of default under any of our credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to pay dividends on our preferred stock in the future. If we fail to pay dividends on our preferred stock, (i) the market price of our preferred stock will likely be adversely affected; (ii) we will no longer be eligible to use the abbreviated and less costly Form S-3 registration statement to register our securities for sale; and (iii) we cannot pay dividends on any junior class of securities or repurchase or redeem any shares of a junior class of security. In addition, if we have four \u201cQuarterly Dividend Defaults,\u201d whether consecutive or non-consecutive, with respect to a series of preferred stock, then (i) the stated dividend rate of the series increases to a stated penalty rate, (ii) the series has the right to appoint two directors to our board and (iii) if not paid in cash, dividends must be paid in shares of common stock or (if the common stock is not publicly traded) in shares of the series of preferred stock (until the dividend default has been cured). A \u201cQuarterly Dividend Default\u201d is any failure to pay in full a monthly dividend within any quarterly dividend period.\nOur outstanding warrants, stock options, stock appreciation rights and Depositary Shares, which are exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock, may be exercised or converted, and the vesting restrictions on our outstanding shares of restricted common stock may lapse, which would dilute our existing common stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had:\ni.\noutstanding warrants that had an exercise price of (a) $8.50 per warrant share and a final maturity of April 2016 and were exercisable for an aggregate of 17,030,622 shares of our common stock and (b) $8.50 per warrant share and a final maturity of April 2016 and were exercisable for an aggregate of 2,142,858 shares of our common stock;\nii.\noutstanding employee and director stock options and stock appreciation rights that had exercise prices ranging from $0.51 to $7.95 per share and covered an aggregate of 13,194,956 shares of our common stock (and of which an aggregate of 9,140,323 stock options and stock appreciation rights, or approximately 69.3%, were exercisable as of December 31, 2014 and of which an aggregate of 176,225 stock options and stock appreciation rights, or approximately 1.3%, had exercise prices below $3.14, the closing sales price of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2014;\niii.\n2,317,013 shares of restricted common stock that will vest in tranches over time through January 8, 2017; and\niv.\noutstanding Depositary Shares representing our Series E Preferred Stock that had a conversion price (based on stated liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends) of $8.50 per share of common stock and were exercisable for an aggregate of 10,945,753 shares of our common stock.\nAny such exercise or conversion will be dilutive to the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock and securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock in the public markets and the issuance of shares of common stock and securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock in future acquisitions.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us or by other parties in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of such shares in the public market could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of common stock.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock and securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock in furtherance of our acquisitions and development of assets or businesses. If we use our shares for this purpose, the issuances could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock, depending on market conditions at the time of such an event, the price we pay, the value of the assets or business acquired and our success in exploiting the properties or integrating the businesses we acquire and other factors.", "PERMNO": 91419, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BRMR"}
