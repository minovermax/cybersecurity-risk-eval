{"cik": "1494582", "company": "BOSTON OMAHA Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the risks discussed below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS\nWe are reliant on the success of our expansion plans.\nOur growth strategy depends to a significant degree upon our ability to successfully acquire, develop and profitably operate new businesses, in both the outdoor billboard and insurance industries and in other industries and markets which we may choose to enter. The successful acquisition and development of new businesses will depend on a number of factors, including the identification and availability of suitable assets, businesses or acquisition candidates, the determination of new industries in which to expand, the availability of adequate financing, the hiring, training and retention of qualified employees, the ability of management to effectively control the expansion process, and other factors, some or all of which may be beyond our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our growth strategy, to acquire new businesses on a timely and cost-efficient basis or to operate our new businesses profitably. If the expected operating efficiencies from such transactions do not materialize, if we fail to integrate new businesses into our existing portfolio, or if the costs of such integration exceed expectations, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIncreased operating expenses associated with the expansion of our business may negatively impact our operating income.\nIncreased operating expenses associated with any expansion of our business may negatively impact our income as we, among other things:\n* seek to acquire related businesses;\n* expand geographically;\n*\nmake significant capital expenditures to support our ability to provide services in our existing businesses; and\n*\nincur increased general and administrative expenses as we grow.\nAs a result of these factors, we may not achieve, sustain or increase our profitability on an ongoing basis.\nWe have limited experience in acquiring other companies and businesses, and we may have difficulty integrating the operations of companies or businesses that we may acquire and may incur substantial costs in connection therewith.\nA significant component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of other operations. Our experience acquiring companies has been relatively limited to date. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic transactions. From time to time, we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions. The costs and benefits of future acquisitions are uncertain. Any of these transactions could be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of integrating the operations of an acquired company may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The key areas where we may face risks and uncertainties include:\n*\nthe need to implement or remediate appropriate controls, procedures and policies at companies that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n*\ndisruption of ongoing business, diversion of resources and of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisitions and integration challenges;\n*\nour ability to achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions by successfully marketing the service offerings of acquired businesses to our existing partners and customers, or by successfully marketing our existing service offerings to customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n*\nthe negative impact of acquisitions on our results of operations as a result of large one-time charges, substantial debt or liabilities acquired or incurred, amortization or write down of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, or adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n*\nthe need to ensure that we comply with all regulatory requirements in connection with and following the completion of acquisitions;\n*\nthe possibility of acquiring unknown or unanticipated contingencies or liabilities;\n*\nretaining employees and clients and otherwise preserving the value of the assets of the businesses we acquire; and\n*\nthe need to integrate each acquired business's accounting, information technology, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management\nIf we identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may be unable to acquire businesses on terms that we consider acceptable due to a variety of factors, including competition from other strategic buyers or financial buyers. Furthermore, in order to achieve the growth we seek, we may acquire numerous smaller market participants, which could require significant attention from management and increase risks, costs and uncertainties associated with integration.\nThe businesses and other assets we acquire in the future may not achieve sufficient revenue or profitability to justify our investment, and any difficulties we may encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations and reduce operating margins. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuance of our equity securities, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and fluctuations in quarterly results and expenses.\nAdverse economic conditions could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer and commercial spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates and tax rates could reduce our revenues. A general reduction in the level of business activity could adversely affect our financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our formation in 2009. Our net loss for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $3,173,375 and $1,047,423, respectively. We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of securities. In addition, as we acquire other businesses, we incur ongoing depreciation and amortization charges, which are typically spread over several years, as well as the costs of completing such acquisitions, which are expensed as incurred. For these reasons, we may continue to incur significant operating losses in the medium term. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.\nWe face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than us, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nThe outdoor billboard industry and insurance industries are highly competitive. There is a concentration in the ownership of billboards in the geographic markets in which we compete and several larger companies dominate the surety insurance business. Further, new competitors may regularly enter the market. Any additional industries or markets that we may enter through future acquisitions will also likely be occupied by established competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, product development and human resources than us. Accordingly, even if there is a large market for our products and services in the industries in which we compete, there can be no assurance that our products and services will be purchased by consumers at a rate sufficient for us to achieve our growth objectives.\nOur management recognizes that we will, therefore, be forced to compete primarily on the basis of price, location, performance, service, and other factors. Our management believes that our ability to achieve sustained profitability will depend primarily on our ability to consummate acquisitions of assets and businesses in competitive markets, skillfully allocate capital, and establish competitive advantages in each of our businesses. This approach requires that our management perform at a high level and is fraught with risks, many of which are beyond our control or ability to foresee.\nRestrictions on outdoor advertising of tobacco, alcohol and other products may restrict the base of clients that can advertise with us.\nSettlements between major tobacco companies and all U.S. states and certain U.S. territories include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. Alcohol products and other products may be future targets of advertising bans, and legislation, litigation or out-of-court settlements may result in the implementation of additional advertising restrictions that impact our business. Any significant reduction in alcohol-related advertising or the advertising of other products due to content-related restrictions could negatively impact our revenues generated from such businesses and cause an increase in the existing inventory of available outdoor billboard space throughout the industry.\nIf actual insurance claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs we grow our insurance operations, we will be establishing claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. These reserves will not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead will represent management estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date.\nThe process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures; economic conditions including general inflation; legal trends and legislative changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses will be difficult to estimate. We also expect that claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimation difficulties will also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer).\nThe estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may also be more difficult during times of adverse or uncertain economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties, increased frequency of small claims or delays in the reporting of claims.\nWe will attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. Due to the recent acquisition of our insurance subsidiary and the inherent uncertainty underlying claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than will be currently reserved.\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. In addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial position.\nAdverse economic factors, including recession, inflation, periods of high unemployment or lower economic activity could result in the sale of fewer surety policies than expected or an increase in frequency or severity of claims and premium defaults or both, which, in turn, could affect the growth and profitability of our surety insurance business.\nFactors, such as business revenue, economic conditions, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation can affect the business and economic environment. These same factors affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. In an economic downturn that is characterized by higher unemployment, declining spending and reduced corporate revenues, the demand for insurance products is generally adversely affected, which directly affects our premium levels and profitability. Negative economic factors may also affect our ability to receive the appropriate rate for the risk we insure with our policyholders and may adversely affect the number of policies we can write, including with respect to our opportunities to underwrite profitable business. In an economic downturn, our customers may have less need for insurance coverage. A decline in our financial strength rating may adversely affect the amount of business we write.\nParticipants in the insurance industry use ratings from independent ratings agencies, such as A.M. Best, as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers. In setting its ratings, A.M. Best uses a quantitative and qualitative analysis of a company's balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile. This analysis includes comparisons to peers and industry standards as well as assessments of operating plans, philosophy and management. A.M. Best financial strength ratings range from \"A++\" (Superior) to \"F\" for insurance companies that have been publicly placed in liquidation. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, A.M. Best has assigned a financial strength rating of \"A-\" (Excellent) to our operating subsidiary, UC&S. A.M. Best assigns ratings that are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurance company's ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and such ratings are not evaluations directed to investors and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common stock or any other securities we may issue. A.M. Best periodically reviews our financial strength rating and may revise it downward or revoke it at its sole discretion based primarily on its analysis of our balance sheet strength (including capital adequacy and loss adjustment expense reserve adequacy), operating performance and business profile. Factors that could affect such analysis include but are not limited to:\n*\nif we change our business practices from our organizational business plan in a manner that no longer supports A.M. Best's rating;\n*\nif unfavorable financial, regulatory or market trends affect us, including excess market capacity;\n*\nif our losses exceed our loss reserves;\n*\nif we have unresolved issues with government regulators;\n*\nif we are unable to retain our senior management or other key personnel;\n*\nif our investment portfolio incurs significant losses; or\n*\nif A.M. Best alters its capital adequacy assessment methodology in a manner that would adversely affect our rating.\nThese and other factors could result in a downgrade of our financial strength rating. A downgrade or withdrawal of our rating could result in any of the following consequences, among others:\n*\ncausing our current and future brokers and insureds to choose other, more highly-rated competitors;\n*\nincreasing the cost or reducing the availability of reinsurance to us;\n*\nseverely limiting or preventing us from writing new insurance contracts; or\n*\ngiving any future potential lenders the right to accelerate or call on any future debt we may incur.\nIn addition, in view of the earnings and capital pressures recently experienced by many financial institutions, including insurance companies, it is possible that rating organizations will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, will increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, will request additional information from the companies that they rate or will increase the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations' models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. We can offer no assurance that our rating will remain at its current level. It is possible that such reviews of us may result in adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks.\nA number of our planned business initiatives in the insurance markets we intend to serve will involve developing new products or expanding existing products in targeted markets. This includes the following efforts, from time to time, to protect or grow market share:\n*\nWe may refine our underwriting processes.\n*\nWe may seek to expand distribution channels.\n*\nWe may focus on geographic markets within or outside of the United States where we have had relatively little or no market share.\nWe may not be successful in introducing new products or expanding in targeted markets and, even if we are successful, these efforts may create enhanced risks. Among other risks:\n*\nDemand for new products or in new markets may not meet our expectations.\n*\nTo the extent we are able to market new products or expand in new markets, our risk exposures may change, and the data and models we use to manage such exposures may not be as sophisticated or effective as those we use in existing markets or with existing products. This, in turn, could lead to losses in excess of our expectations.\n*\nModels underlying underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective.\n*\nEfforts to develop new products or markets have the potential to create or increase distribution channel conflict.\n*\nTo develop new products or markets, we may need to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, which may also negatively impact results in the near term.\nIf our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets are not successful, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may lack operational control over certain companies in which we invest.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, certain strategic investments in various businesses without acquiring all or a majority ownership stake in those businesses. To the extent that such investments represent a minority or passive stake in any business, we may have little to no participation, input or control over the management, policies, and operations of such business. Further, we may lack sufficient ownership of voting securities to impact, without the vote of additional equity holders, any matters submitted to shareholders or members of such business for a vote.\nThere is inherent risk in making minority equity investments into companies over which we have little to no control. Without control of the management and decision-making of these businesses, we cannot control their direction, strategy, policies and business plans, and we may be powerless to improve any declines in their performance, operating results and financial condition. If any company in which we are a minority investor suffers adverse effects, it may not be able to continue as a going business concern, and we may lose our entire investment.\nGovernmental regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur billboard businesses are regulated by governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations could limit our growth by putting constraints on the number, location and timing of billboards we wish to erect. New regulations and changes to existing regulations may also curtail our ability to expand our billboard business and adversely affect us by reducing our revenues or increasing our operating expenses.\nWe will also be subject to maintaining compliance within the highly regulated insurance industry as we continue our pursuit of opportunities in that market, including the maintenance of certain levels of operating capital and reserves. Generally, the extensive regulations are designed to benefit or protect policyholders, rather than our investors, or to reduce systemic financial risk. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to disciplinary action, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in the insurance industry. Changes to the regulatory environment in the insurance industry may cause us to adjust our views or practices regarding regulatory risk management, and necessitate changes to our operations that may limit our growth or have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, certain of the other new markets and industries that we may choose to enter may be regulated by a variety of federal, state and local agencies.\nWe are subject to extensive insurance regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiary, UC&S, is subject to extensive regulation in Massachusetts, its state of domicile, and to a lesser degree, the other states in which it operates. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of investors or stockholders. These regulations generally are administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things, authorizations to write excess and surplus lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment and underwriting limitations, affiliate transactions, dividend limitations, changes in control, solvency and a variety of other financial and non-financial aspects of our business. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could further limit our discretion or make it more expensive to conduct our business. State insurance regulators also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may impose timing and expense constraints that could adversely affect our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives.\nIn addition, state insurance regulators have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, state insurance regulators could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or could otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could interfere with our operations and require us to bear additional costs of compliance, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe NAIC has adopted a system to test the adequacy of capital of insurance companies, known as \"risk-based capital.\" The Risk-Based Capital Formula establishes the minimum amount of capital necessary for a company to support its overall business operations. It identifies property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at three major areas: 1) Asset Risk; 2) Underwriting Risk; and 3) Other Risk. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Failure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiary to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business.\nBecause we are a holding company and a significant portion of our operations are conducted by our UC&S insurance subsidiary, our ability to pay dividends may depend on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other permitted payments from our insurance subsidiary.\nBecause we are a holding company with no business operations of our own, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders will likely depend in significant part on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including our insurance subsidiary, UC&S. State insurance laws, including the laws of Massachusetts, restrict the ability of UC&S to declare stockholder dividends. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. Consequently, the maximum dividend distribution is limited by Massachusetts law. State insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent the reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends up to the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted. Moreover, state insurance regulators that have jurisdiction over the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiary may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect.\nThe declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors. See \"Dividend Policy.\"\nWe may be unable to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable prices or on terms that adequately protect us.\nWe use reinsurance to help manage our exposure to insurance risks. Reinsurance is a practice whereby one insurer, called the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, called the ceding insurer, for all or part of the potential liability arising from one or more insurance policies issued by the ceding insurer. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity, which can affect our business volume and profitability. In addition, reinsurance programs are generally subject to renewal on an annual basis. We may not be able to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms or from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. If we are unable to obtain new reinsurance facilities or to renew expiring facilities, our net exposures would increase. In such event, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in our net exposure, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, which would reduce our revenues.\nMany reinsurance companies have begun to exclude certain coverages from, or alter terms in, the reinsurance contracts. As a result, we, like other direct insurance companies, write insurance policies which to some extent do not have the benefit of reinsurance protection. These gaps in reinsurance protection expose us to greater risk and greater potential losses.\nOur employees could take excessive risks, which could negatively affect our financial condition and business.\nAs a business which anticipates it will derive a significant portion of its business from the sale of surety and other insurance products, we are in the business of binding certain risks. The employees who conduct our business, including executive officers and other members of management, underwriters, product managers and other employees, do so in part by making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines and standards, product design and pricing, determining which business opportunities to pursue and other decisions. We endeavor, in the design and implementation of our compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our employees incentives to take excessive risks. Employees may, however, take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor employees' business decisions and prevent them from taking excessive risks, these controls and procedures may not be effective. If our employees take excessive risks, the impact of those risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.\nWe may need a significant amount of additional capital, which could substantially dilute your investment.\nWe may need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such funds upon favorable terms and conditions, if at all. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions that may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, and conversion and redemption rights, subject to applicable law, and at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. We have recently filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to $46 million of our common stock to the public and our current stockholders. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to fund future acquisitions, provide additional capital for our insurance operations as may be required by insurance regulators, and for general working capital purposes. There can be no assurance that the planned public offering will be successful.\nSuch issuances and the exercise of any convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders, and may affect the value of our capital stock and could adversely affect the rights of the holders of such stock, thereby reducing the value of such stock. Moreover, any exercise of convertible securities may adversely affect the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital, since the holders of such convertible securities can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in such convertible securities.\nIf we sell shares or other equity securities in one or more other transactions, or issue stock or stock options pursuant to any future employee equity incentive plan, investors may be materially diluted by such subsequent issuances.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel and other skilled or qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. Workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in fields that offer a more desirable work environment. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations according to geographic demand for our services depends in part on our ability to relocate or increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers in our areas of operations can be high, the supply may be limited and we may be unable to relocate our employees from areas of lower utilization to areas of higher demand. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. Further, a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand could result in a reduction of the available skilled labor force, and there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve following a subsequent increase in demand for our services or an increase in wage rates. If any of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nWe depend heavily on the efforts of executive officers, managers and other key employees to manage our operations. The unexpected loss or unavailability of key members of management or technical personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nDisruptions or similar problems could increase our expenses.\nA natural disaster or an act of terrorism could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or facilities and cause us to incur additional expenses and lose revenue. The occurrence of such extraordinary events may impact our properties specifically or the economy generally, and may substantially decrease the use of and demand for advertising, the market for insurance or negatively impact other areas of our business. The occurrence of future terrorist attacks, severe weather conditions, military actions, contagious disease outbreaks or similar events cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to cause local or nationwide disruptions of commercial activities, which may expose us to substantial liabilities, decrease our revenues or increase our expenses. The insurance we maintain against natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case, which would require us to expend significant resources to replace any destroyed assets, thereby materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and prospects.\nCash and cash equivalents represent one of our largest assets and we may be at risk of being uninsured for a large portion of such assets.\nA very significant portion of our assets are currently held in cash at a few banking institutions. As a result, a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance limits. If the institution at which we have placed our funds were to become insolvent or fail, we could be at risk for losing a substantial portion of our cash deposits, or incur significant time delays in obtaining access to such funds. In light of the limited amount of federal insurance for deposits, even if we were to spread our cash assets among several institutions, we would remain at risk for the amount not covered by insurance.\nWe are subject to extensive financial reporting and related requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources. In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to (i) upgrade our systems, (ii) implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, (iii) implement an internal audit function, and (iv) hire additional accounting, internal audit and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective manner, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a negative impact on our ability to manage our business and on our stock price.\nWe may be at risk to accurately report financial results or detect fraud if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report that contains an assessment by management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In performing the assessment, management noted that we lack an independent audit committee, we have an insufficient number of independent directors, and we lack a formal risk assessment process and monitoring structure. Our management believes that the preceding factors raise a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements may not be timely prevented or detected and should therefore be considered a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Because of this material weakness, our management believes that as of December 31, 2016, our company's internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective.\nWhile we are consistently working on improvements and conducting rigorous reviews of our internal controls over financial reporting, our independent auditors may interpret Section 404 requirements and apply related rules and regulations differently. We are a smaller reporting company not currently subject to having our outside auditors attest to our internal controls. When we do become subject to these requirements, if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented, operated or reviewed, they may decline to accept management's assessment and not provide an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, or may issue an adverse opinion with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, if we are not able to meet all the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the SEC. We cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting will be identified in the future. Also, future changes in our accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory environment may create new areas of risk exposure. Failure to adequately implement our existing control environment accordingly may impair our controls over financial reporting and cause our investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur executive officers and directors may experience a conflict of interest between their duties to us and to affiliated parties.\nOur Co-Chief Executive Officers, Adam K. Peterson and Alex B. Rozek, are each managing members of separate investment management entities, which are our two largest shareholders. While we have deemed that the outside business endeavors of our management team do not currently constitute a conflict of interest, it is possible that a conflict of interest could arise between the performance of our executive management team and their roles as managing members of entities which together own a majority of our outstanding capital stock. Such conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. We have the authority to engage various contracting parties, which may be affiliates of ours or of our directors. As such, our directors may have a conflict of interest between their fiduciary duties to manage the business for our benefit and our stockholders and their direct and indirect affiliates' interests in establishing and maintaining relationships with us and in obtaining compensation for services rendered to us. With respect to such affiliates, there may be an absence of arms' length negotiations with respect to the terms, conditions and consideration with respect to goods and services provided to or by us.\nInvestors should not rely on the accuracy of forward-looking statements made by us.\nTo the extent that we or any of our officers were to provide any projections, financial forecasts, or other forward-looking statements, investors must recognize that any such forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions and estimates. We cannot make any representations as to the accuracy and reasonableness of such assumptions or the forward-looking statements based thereon. The validity and accuracy of those forward-looking statements will depend in large part on future events that we cannot foresee, and may or may not prove to be correct. Consequently, there can be no assurance that our actual operating results will correspond to any of the projections or forecasts. Accordingly, an investment in our common stock should not be made in reliance on projections or forecasts prepared by us.\nIf our securities are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market in the future, we will likely be a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMagnolia controls a significant portion of our outstanding common stock and, through its ownership of our Class A common stock, controls a majority of all voting. In connection with our planned public offering, we intend to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. There can be no assurance that the offering will be successfully completed and that our common stock will trade on the NASDAQ Global Market. If our securities are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we will be considered a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules. Under the NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have director nominees selected or recommended for the board's selection, either by a majority vote of only the independent directors or by a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors, with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nominations process; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities.\nIf we qualify for a listing on any NASDAQ market, we intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, we will not have a majority of independent directors nor will our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that some stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, possibly depressing the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace members of our management team.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \"poison pill\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by our Board of Directors at the time of issuance or fixed by resolution without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and, therefore, could reduce the value of our common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock could delay, discourage, prevent or make it more difficult or costly to acquire or effect a change in control, thereby preserving the current stockholders' control.\nTaking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \"emerging growth companies\" may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nwe are not required to engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nwe are not required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u2022\nwe are not required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as \"say-on-pay,\" \"say-on-frequency\" and \"say-on-golden parachutes\"; and\n\u2022\nwe are not required to disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer's compensation to median employee compensation.\nWe may take advantage of these provisions through the end of 2017 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens.\nA very limited market currently exists for the sale or resale of our common stock and there are limitations on transferability.\nAlthough we are listed on the OTCQX market, no established and consistent trading of our securities currently exists. A market with consistent trading of our securities may never develop and you therefore may not be able to liquidate your investment. Therefore, our common stock should be considered a long-term investment, as investors may be unable to liquidate the investment and should be prepared to bear the economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period.\nWe do not know whether a public market will develop for our common stock, and public registration of our common stock may create a variety of risks.\nOur current OTCQX listing creates a variety of risks:\n*\nIf a market for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock at an attractive price or at all. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade.\n*\nSince our common stock is thinly traded, its trading price is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, without limitation, the trading volume of our shares; the number of securities analysts, market-makers and brokers, if any, following our common stock; new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors; actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; conditions or trends in our business industries; announcements by us of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; sales of our common stock; and general stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly-traded, and particularly microcap, companies. Investors may have difficulty reselling our common stock, either at or above the price they paid for our stock, or even at fair market value. The stock markets often experience significant price and volume changes that are not related to the operating performance of individual companies, and because our common stock could be thinly traded it is particularly susceptible to such changes. These broad market changes may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of how well we perform as a company. In addition, there is a history of securities class action litigation following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities. Although there is no such litigation currently pending or threatened against us, such a suit against us could result in the incursion of substantial legal fees, potential liabilities and the diversion of management's attention and resources from our business.\n*\nThe market price for the common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as variations in quarterly and yearly operating results, general trends in the industries in which we operate, and changes in state or federal regulations affecting us and our industries. Furthermore, in recent years the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. Such broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our stock, if a market for it develops, and the market price of our stock may be similarly volatile and subject to such wide fluctuations.\n*\nOur business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. A wide variety of factors continue to impact economic conditions and consumer confidence. These factors include, among others, concerns over the pace of economic growth in the U.S., continued low interest rates, the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans to further raise short-term interest rates, the strength of the U.S. Dollar, global economic factors including quantitative easing or similar programs by the European Central Bank, the potential breakup of the European Union resulting from the exit by one or more member states, the recent slowdown and resulting economic turmoil in China, volatile energy costs, and domestic and geopolitical issues, as well as government interpretations and actions changing the regulatory environment and the tax system under which we operate. Certain of these factors could have an adverse effect on us. Our revenues may decline, our profit margins could erode and we could incur significant losses.\n*\nWe may provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Any such guidance will be comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements. Whether or not we provide guidance, investment analysts may publish their estimates of our future financial performance. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance we have provided or the expectations of investment analysts, especially in times of economic uncertainty. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of investment analysts or if we or investment analysts reduce estimates of our performance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.\n*\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for their shares. As a result, our stockholders may suffer a loss on their investment.\n*\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\n*\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we elect to take advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We may take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\n*\nOur common stock is deemed to be \"penny stock\" as that term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Penny stocks are stocks: (a) with a price of less than $5.00 per share; (b) that are not traded on a \"recognized\" national exchange; (c) whose prices are not quoted on the NASDAQ automated quotation system (NASDAQ - where listed stocks must still meet requirement (a) above); or (d) in issuers with net tangible assets of less than $2,000,000 (if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or $5,000,000 (if in continuous operation for less than three years), or with average revenues of less than $6,000,000 for the last three years. Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15g-2 under the Exchange Act require broker dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor's account. Potential investors in our common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any common stock that are deemed to be \"penny stock.\" Moreover, Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act requires broker dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. Compliance with this procedure may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. Holders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, dated April 17, 1991, the market for penny stocks suffers from patterns of fraud and abuse.\nWe have filed for a public offering of our common stock on a Form S-1 registration statement, intending to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. There can be no assurance that the public offering will be consummated or successful. If the public offering is successful, many of the same risks described above regarding our current OTCQX listing will continue.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company in the United States.\nAs a public company in the United States, we will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses, including costs associated with U.S. public company reporting requirements. We will also incur costs associated with listing requirements, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC. The expenses incurred by U.S. public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations would increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting, and compliance activities, as well as other expenses not currently incurred. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market in future sales, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of all of our shares of common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we had 5,841,815 shares of common stock outstanding. All shares can now be sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal securities laws.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to existing stockholders and may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \"ownership change\" to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An \"ownership change\" is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation's stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating losses (NOLs), credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company's stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. This could result in increased U.S. federal income tax liability for us if we generate taxable income in a future period. Limitations on the use of NOLs and other tax attributes could also increase our state tax liability. The use of our tax attributes will also be limited to the extent that we do not generate positive taxable income in future tax periods. As a result of these limitations, we may be unable to offset future taxable income (if any) with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire. Accordingly, these limitations may increase our federal income tax liability.\nAlthough we have not experienced an ownership change since February 2015, it is possible that future transactions may cause us to undergo one or more ownership changes. As of December 31, 2016, we have U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $4.5 million. Certain of these NOLs may be at risk of limitation in the event of a future ownership change.\nWe have U.S. federal and state NOLs. In general, NOLs in one state cannot be used to offset income in any other state. Accordingly, we may be subject to tax in certain jurisdictions even if we have unused NOLs in other jurisdictions. Also, each jurisdiction in which we operate may have its own limitations on our ability to utilize NOLs or tax credit carryovers generated in that jurisdiction. These limitations may increase our federal, state, and/or foreign income tax liability.\nOur directors have limited liability under Delaware law.\nPursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Delaware law, our directors are not liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except for: liability in connection with a breach of the duty of loyalty; acts or omissions not in good faith; acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; dividend payments or stock repurchases that are illegal under Delaware law; or any transaction in which a director has derived an improper personal benefit. Accordingly, except in those circumstances, our directors will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of their duty.\nOur two principal stockholders currently control all voting matters brought before our Board of Directors and shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors, which currently consists solely of the two directors appointed by the holders of the Company's Class A common stock voting as a separate class and two additional directors, approves the Company's annual budget, compensation matters, and major agreements. Currently, the two largest shareholders of the Company, Boulderado Partners, LLC and Magnolia Capital Fund, LP, collectively own all of our Class A common stock and a majority of our common stock, and will continue to own all of the outstanding Class A common stock and a majority of the outstanding common stock. Further, each share of Class A common stock is entitled to cast 10 votes for all matters on which our stockholders vote, while each share of common stock is entitled to cast only one vote. Assuming all currently exercisable warrants are exercised, Magnolia and Boulderado collectively own approximately 82.6% of our current outstanding shares of common stock and Class A Common Stock on a combined basis. As each share of Class A common stock has 10 votes for each share of common stock, Magnolia and Boulderado combined control the voting of 93.0% of all votes held by the holders of Class A common stock and common stock on a combined basis. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, the two majority shareholders will continue to control virtually all matters submitted to shareholders for a vote; may elect all of our directors; and, as a result, may control our management, policies, and operations. Our other shareholders will not have voting control over the company's actions, including the determination of other industries and markets that we may elect to enter.\nOur currently outstanding Class A common stock allows the holders of Class A common stock to elect two Directors who can each veto many important actions requiring approval of our board of directors.\nThe holders of our Class A common stock are also allowed to elect two Class A Directors to our Board of Directors. Under the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, certain significant matters requiring approval by the Board of Directors also require the unanimous approval of our Class A Directors. Each of Boulderado and Magnolia agreed as part of the Voting and First Refusal Agreement entered into on June 19, 2015 to elect as the Class A Directors each of Alex B. Rozek, as a nominee of Boulderado and Adam Peterson, as a nominee of Magnolia. In the event of (a) the death of a Class A Director, (b) the incapacitation of a Class A Director as a result of illness or accident, which makes it reasonably unlikely that the Class A Director will be able to perform his normal duties for the Company for a period of ninety (90) days, or (c) a change of control of Boulderado or Magnolia, then the Class A stockholder which nominated such dead or incapacitated Class A Director, or the Class A stockholder undergoing such change of control, shall convert all of such Class A common stock into shares of our Common Stock, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Voting and First Refusal Agreement also provides each of the Company and the other party to the Voting Agreement with the right of first refusal to purchase the Class A common stock proposed to be sold by the other holder of Class A common stock.\nAt any time when shares of Class A common stock are outstanding, we may not, without the affirmative vote of all of the Class A Directors:\n* Amend, alter or otherwise change the rights, preferences or privileges of the Class A common stock, or amend, alter or repeal any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class A common stock.\n* Liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our business, effect any merger or consolidation or any other deemed liquidation event or consent to any of the foregoing.\n* Create, or authorize the creation of, or issue or issue additional shares of Class A common stock, or increase the authorized number of shares of any additional class or series of capital stock.\n* Increase or decrease the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors.\n* Hire, terminate, change the compensation of, or amend the employment agreements of, our executive officers.\n* Purchase or redeem (or permit any subsidiary to purchase or redeem) or pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on, any shares of our capital stock.\n* Create, or authorize the creation of, or issue, or authorize the issuance of any debt security, if our aggregate indebtedness for borrowed money following such action would exceed $10,000, or guarantee, any indebtedness except for our own trade accounts arising in the ordinary course of business.\n* Make, or permit any subsidiary to make, any loan or advance outside of the ordinary course of business to any employee or director.\n* Create, or hold capital stock in, any subsidiary that is not wholly owned (either directly or through one or more other subsidiaries) by us or permit any direct or indirect subsidiary to sell, lease, otherwise dispose all or substantially all of the assets of any subsidiary.\n* Change our principal business, enter new lines of business, or exit the current line of business.\n* Enter into any agreement involving the payment, contribution, or assignment by us or to us of money or assets greater than $10,000.\n* Enter into or be a party to any transaction outside of the ordinary course of business with any our directors, officers, or employees or any \"associate\" (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) of any such person or entity.\n* Acquire, by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or otherwise, any material assets or securities of any other corporation, partnership or other entity.\nOur board of directors is not composed of a majority of independent directors which poses a significant risk for us from a corporate governance perspective.\nOur two co-chief executive officers serve as two of our four directors. Another director is the principal of a real estate brokerage and management company, in which we currently have a 30% ownership interest and a separate real estate entity in which we own a 15% equity interest. Our directors and executive officers are required to make interested party decisions, such as the approval of related party transactions, their level of compensation, and oversight of our accounting function. Our two majority shareholders also exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the nomination of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. We have chosen not to implement various corporate governance measures at this time, the absence of which may cause stockholders to have more limited protections against transactions implemented by our Board of Directors, conflicts of interest and similar matters. Stockholders should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the Company more difficult, including, but not limited to, the following:\n*\nsetting forth specific procedures regarding how our stockholders may nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n*\npermitting our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n*\nlimiting the rights of stockholders to amend our bylaws.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire. In addition, because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nBecause we currently have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nWe currently do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any additional future earnings to finance our operations and growth. Any future determination to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operation results, capital requirements, and contractual, regulatory and other restrictions, including restrictions contained in any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur, on the payment of dividends by us or by our subsidiaries to us, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. As a result, stockholders may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless they sell our common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nOur authorized preferred stock exposes holders of our common stock to certain risks.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The authorized but unissued preferred stock constitutes what is commonly referred to as \"blank check\" preferred stock. This type of preferred stock may be issued by the Board of Directors from time to time on any number of occasions, without shareholder approval, as one or more separate series of shares comprised of any number of the authorized but un-issued shares of preferred stock, designated by resolution of the Board of Directors stating the name and number of shares of each series and setting forth separately for such series the relative rights, privileges and preferences thereof, including, if any, the: (i) rate of dividends payable thereon; (ii) price, terms and conditions of redemption; (iii) voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences; (iv) provisions of a sinking fund for redemption or repurchase; (v) terms of conversion to common stock, including conversion price, and (vi) voting rights. Such preferred stock may provide our Board of Directors the ability to hinder or discourage any attempt to gain control of us by a merger, tender offer at a control premium price, proxy contest or otherwise. Consequently, the preferred stock could entrench our management. The market price of our common stock could be depressed to some extent by the existence of the preferred stock. As of the date of this Annual Report, no shares of preferred stock had been issued.", "PERMNO": 16779, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "BOMN"}
