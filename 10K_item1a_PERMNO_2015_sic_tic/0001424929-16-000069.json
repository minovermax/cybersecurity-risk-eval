RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks related to our business\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new products that respond to consumer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products, and our business and financial results could suffer.\nOur growth strategy involves the continuous development of innovative performance products. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers and the end users of our products, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new, innovative products in the global markets in which we compete. In addition, we must continuously compete not only for end users who purchase our products through the dealers and distributors who are our customers, but also for the OEMs, which incorporate our products into their bikes and powered vehicles. These OEMs regularly evaluate our products against those of our competitors to determine if they are allowing the OEMs to achieve higher sales and market share on a cost-effective basis. Should one or more of our OEM customers determine that they could achieve overall better financial results by incorporating a competitor\u2019s new or existing product, they would likely do so, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nProduct development requires significant financial, technological and other resources. While we expended approximately $17.0 million, $13.6 million and $10.4 million for our research and development efforts in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, there can be no assurance that this level of investment in research and development will be sufficient in the future to maintain our competitive advantage in product innovation, which could cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to suffer.\nProduct improvements and new product introductions require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels, and we may experience unanticipated delays in our introduction of product improvements or new products. Our competitors\u2019 new products may beat our products to market, be more effective and/or less expensive than our products, obtain better market acceptance or render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful sales or profits for us relative to our expectations. In addition, one of our competitors could develop an unforeseen and entirely new product or technology that renders our products less desirable or obsolete, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in all product lines, including from some competitors that may have greater financial and marketing resources. Failure to compete effectively against competitors would negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe ride dynamics industry is highly competitive. We compete with a number of other manufacturers that produce and sell ride dynamics products to OEMs and aftermarket dealers and distributors, including OEMs that produce their own lines of products for their own use. Our continued success depends on our ability to continue to compete effectively against our competitors, some of which have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Also, several of our competitors offer broader product lines to OEMs, which they may sell in connection with suspension products as part of a package offering. In the future, our competitors may be able to maintain and grow brand strength and market share more effectively or quickly than we do by anticipating the course of market developments more accurately than we do, developing products that are superior to our products, creating manufacturing or distribution capabilities that are superior to ours, producing similar products at a lower cost than we can or adapting more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving regulatory, industry or customer requirements, among other possibilities. In addition, we may encounter increased competition if our current competitors broaden their product offerings by beginning to produce additional types of ride dynamics products or through competitor consolidations. We could also face competition from well-capitalized entrants into the performance suspension and ride dynamics product market, as well as aggressive pricing tactics by other manufacturers trying to gain market share. As a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors\u2019 products, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to economic conditions that impact consumer spending. Our suspension and ride dynamics products, and the bike and powered vehicles into which they are incorporated, are discretionary purchases and may be adversely impacted by changes in the economy.\nOur business depends substantially on global economic and market conditions. In particular, we believe that currently a significant majority of the end users of our products live in the United States and countries in Europe. These areas are either in the process of recovering from recession or, in some cases, are still struggling with recession, disruption in banking and/or financial systems, economic weakness and uncertainty. In addition, our products are recreational in nature and are generally discretionary purchases by consumers. Consumers are usually more willing to make discretionary purchases during periods of favorable general economic conditions and high consumer confidence. Discretionary spending may also be affected by many other factors, including interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of unfavorable economic conditions, or periods when other negative market factors exist, consumer discretionary spending is typically reduced, which in turn could reduce our product sales and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere could also be a number of secondary effects resulting from an economic downturn, such as insolvency of our suppliers resulting in product delays, an inability of our OEM and distributor and dealer customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products, customers delaying payment to us for the purchase of our products due to financial hardship or an increase in bad debt expense. Any of these effects could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain our premium brand image, our business may suffer.\nOur products are selected by both OEMs and dealers and distributors in part because of the premium brand reputation we hold with them and our end users. Therefore, our success depends on our ability to maintain and build the image of our brands. We have focused on building our brands through producing products or acquiring businesses that produce products that we believe are innovative, high in performance and highly reliable. In addition, our brands benefits from our strong relationships with our OEM customers and dealers and distributors and through marketing programs aimed at bike and powered vehicle enthusiasts in various media and other channels. For example, we sponsor a number of professional athletes and professional race teams. In order to continue to enhance our brand image, we will need to maintain our position in the suspension and ride dynamics products industry and continue to provide high quality products and services. Also, we will need to continue to invest in sponsorships, marketing and public relations.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain or enhance the strength of our brands in the future. Our brands could be adversely impacted by, among other things:\n\u2022failure to develop new products that are innovative, performance and reliable;\n\u2022internal product quality control issues;\n\u2022product quality issues on the bikes and powered vehicles on which our products are installed;\n\u2022product recalls;\n\u2022high profile component failures (such as a component failure during a race on a mountain bike ridden by an athlete that we sponsor);\n\u2022negative publicity regarding our sponsored athletes;\n\u2022high profile injury or death to one of our sponsored athletes;\n\u2022inconsistent uses of our brand and our other intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property; and\n\u2022changes in consumer trends and perceptions.\nAny adverse impact on our brand could in turn negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales are highly dependent on the demand for high-end bikes and a material decline in the demand for these bikes or their suspension components could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nDuring 2015, approximately 58% of our sales were generated from the sale of bike products. Part of our success has been attributable to the growth in the high-end bike industry, including increases in average retail sales prices, as better-performing product designs and technologies have been incorporated into these products. If the popularity of high-end or premium-priced bikes does not increase or declines, the number of bike enthusiasts seeking such bikes or premium priced suspension products, wheels, cranks and other specialty components for their bikes does not increase or declines, or the average price point of these bikes declines, we may fail to achieve future growth or our sales could decrease, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In addition, if current bike enthusiasts stop purchasing our products due to changes in preferences, we may fail to achieve future growth or our sales could be decreased, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur growth in the powered vehicle category is dependent upon our continued ability to expand our product sales into powered vehicles that require performance suspension and the continued expansion of the market for these powered vehicles.\nOur growth in the powered vehicle category is in part attributable to the expansion of the market for powered vehicles that require performance suspension products. Such market growth includes the creation of new classes of vehicles that need our products, such as Side-by-Sides, and our ability to create products for these vehicles. In the event these markets stopped expanding or contracted, or we are unsuccessful in creating new products for these markets or other competitors successfully enter into these markets, we may fail to achieve future growth or our sales could decrease, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nA disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDuring 2015, we transitioned the majority of our bike suspension component product manufacturing to our bike suspension component facility in Taichung, Taiwan. As a result of the transition, we have and may continue to incur costs associated with some duplication of facilities, equipment and personnel, the amount of which could vary materially from our projections. Also, the transition process could cause manufacturing problems and give rise to execution risks, including disruptions to employees, negative impact on employee morale and retention, delays in recognizing efficiencies or increased costs of manufacturing, and adverse impacts on our product quality and delivery times. In addition, we could encounter unforeseen difficulties resulting from the distance and time zone differences between our main operations in California and our Taiwan manufacturing facilities.\nEquipment failures, delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could lead to production or service disruptions, curtailments or shutdowns. In the event of a stoppage in production or a slowdown in production due to high employee turnover or a labor dispute at any of our facilities, even if only temporary, or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control, delivery times to our customers could be severely affected. If there was a manufacturing disruption in any of our manufacturing facilities, we might be unable to meet product delivery requirements and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, even if the disruption was covered in whole or in part by our business interruption insurance. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations, expose us to damage claims from our customers or damage our brand and, in turn, negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWork stoppages or other disruptions at seaports could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our goods move through ports on the Western Coast of the United States. We have a global supply chain and we import products from our third party vendors as well as our Fox Taiwan facility into the U.S. largely through ports on the West Coast. Freight arriving at West Coast ports must be offloaded from ships by longshoremen, none of whom are our employees. We do not control the activities of these employees or seaports and we could suffer supply chain disruptions due to any disputes, capacity shortages, slowdowns or shutdowns which may occur, as was experienced in February, 2015, in relation to certain West Coast ports. While such West Coast ports labor dispute ended with a five year agreement, it lasted longer than we forecasted, and any similar labor dispute in the future could potentially have a negative effect on both our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the contributions, talent and leadership of our senior management team, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Larry L. Enterline. We do not have a \"key person\" life insurance policy on Mr. Enterline or any other key employees. We believe that the top twelve members of our senior management team are key to establishing our focus and executing our corporate strategies as they have extensive knowledge of our systems and processes. Given our senior management team\u2019s knowledge of the suspension products industry and the limited number of direct competitors in the industry, we believe that it could be difficult to find replacements should any of the members of our senior management team leave. Our inability to find suitable replacements for any of the members of our senior management team could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on skilled engineers to develop and create our products, and the failure to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on skilled and well-trained engineers for the design and production of our products, as well as in our research and development functions. Competition for such individuals is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley near where our headquarters are located. Our inability to attract or retain qualified employees in our design, production or research and development functions or elsewhere in our company could result in diminished quality of our products and delinquent production schedules, impede our ability to develop new products and harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to sustain our past growth or successfully implement our growth strategy, which may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe grew our sales from approximately $306.7 million in 2014 to approximately $366.8 million in 2015. This growth rate may be unsustainable. Our future growth will depend upon various factors, including the strength of the image of our brands, our ability to continue to produce innovative suspension and ride dynamics products, consumer acceptance of our products, competitive conditions in the marketplace, our ability to make strategic acquisitions, the growth in emerging markets for products requiring high-end suspension products and, in general, the continued growth of the high-end bike and powered vehicle markets into which we sell our products. Our beliefs regarding the future growth of markets for high-end suspension products are based largely on qualitative judgments and limited sources and may not be reliable. If we are unable to sustain our past growth or successfully implement our growth strategy, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nThe professional athletes and race teams who use our products are an important aspect of the image of our brands. The loss of the support of professional athletes for our products or the inability to attract new professional athletes may harm our business.\nIf our products are not used by current or future professional athletes and race teams, our brands could lose value and our sales could decline. While our sponsorship agreements typically restrict our sponsored athletes and race teams from promoting, endorsing or using competitors\u2019 products that compete directly within our product categories during the term of the sponsorship agreements, we do not typically have long-term contracts with any of the athletes or race teams whom we sponsor.\nIf we are unable to maintain our current relationships with these professional athletes and race teams, if these professional athletes and race teams are no longer popular, if our sponsored athletes and race teams fail to have success or if we are unable to continue to attract the endorsement of new professional athletes and race teams in the future, the value of our brands and our sales could decline.\nWe depend on our relationships with dealers and distributors and their ability to sell and service our products. Any disruption in these relationships could harm our sales.\nWe sell our aftermarket products to dealers and distributors, and we depend on their willingness and ability to market and sell our products to consumers and provide customer and product service as needed. We also rely on our dealers and distributors to be knowledgeable about our products and their features. If we are not able to educate our dealers and distributors so that they may effectively sell our products as part of a positive buying experience, or if they fail to implement effective retail sales initiatives, focus selling efforts on our competitors\u2019 products, reduce the quantity of our products that they sell or reduce their operations due to financial difficulties or otherwise, our brand and business could suffer.\nWe do not control our dealers or distributors and many of our contracts allow these entities to offer our competitors\u2019 products. Our competitors may incentivize our dealers and distributors to favor their products. In addition, we do not have long-term contracts with a majority of our dealers and distributors, and our dealers and distributors are not obligated to purchase specified amounts of our products. In fact, the majority of our dealers and distributors buy from us on a purchase order basis. Consequently, with little or no notice, many of these dealers and distributors may terminate their relationships with us or materially reduce their purchases of our products. If we were to lose one or more of our dealers or distributors, we would need to obtain a new dealer or distributor to cover the particular location or product line, which may not be possible on favorable terms or at all.\nAlternatively, we could use our own sales force to replace such a dealer or distributor, but expanding our sales force into new locations takes a significant amount of time and resources and may not be successful. Further, many of our international distribution contracts contain exclusivity arrangements, which may prevent us from replacing or supplementing our current distributors under certain circumstances.\nWe are a supplier in the high-end bike and powered vehicles markets, and our business is dependent in large part on the orders we receive from our OEM customers and from their success.\nAs a supplier to OEM customers, we are dependent in large part on the success of the business of our OEM customers. Model year changes by our OEM customers may adversely impact our sales or cause our sales to vary from quarter to quarter. In addition, losses in market share individually or a decline in the overall market of our OEM customers or the discontinuance by our OEM customers of their products which incorporate our products could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, if our bike producing OEM customers reduce production of their high-end bikes, their orders to us for our products would in turn be reduced, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA relatively small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of these customers, whether through the temporary or permanent discontinuation of their products which incorporate our products or otherwise, or the loss of market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us and our results of operations.\nSales attributable to our five largest OEM customers, which can vary from year to year, collectively accounted for approximately 32%, 34% and 42% of our sales in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of these OEM customers, whether through the temporary or permanent discontinuation of their products which incorporate our products or otherwise, or the loss of market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn particular, sales to Giant, an OEM and contract manufacturer used by certain of our bike OEM customers, accounted for approximately 12%, 14% and 17% of our sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In the event Giant were to experience manufacturing or other problems, or were to fail to pay us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could impact gross margins and expenses.\nForeign currency fluctuations could in the future have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We sell our products inside and outside of the United States primarily in U.S. Dollars. However, some of the OEMs purchasing products from us sell their products in Europe and other foreign markets using the Euro and other foreign currencies. As a result, as the U.S. Dollar appreciates against these foreign currencies, our products will become relatively more expensive for these OEMs. Accordingly, competitive products that our OEM customers can purchase in other currencies may become more attractive and we could lose sales as these OEMs seek to replace our products with cheaper alternatives. In addition, should the U.S. Dollar depreciate significantly, this could have the effect of decreasing our gross margins and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWith a majority of our manufacturing operations for our bike products occurring in Taiwan, a percentage of our sales and expenses are denominated in the New Taiwan Dollar. Should the New Taiwan Dollar appreciate against the U.S. Dollar, this could have the effect of decreasing our sales, increasing our expenses, and decreasing our profitability.\nAdditionally, with the acquisition of Race Face/Easton in 2014, certain of our operations take place in Canada and a percentage of our sales and expenses are denominated in Canadian Dollars. Furthermore, pursuant to the acquisition agreement and subsequent amendments we are obligated to pay $19.5 million Canadian Dollars of earn-out compensation (equivalent to approximately $14.1 million U.S. Dollars at the December 31, 2015 rate). Our operating profitability could be negatively impacted as a result of changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar.\nOur international operations are exposed to risks associated with conducting business globally.\nAs a result of our international presence, we are exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States. In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:\n\u2022difficulty in transporting materials internationally, including labor disputes at West Coast ports, which handle a large amount of our products;\n\u2022increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights and trade secrets;\n\u2022changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws;\n\u2022exposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022unexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war and other political uncertainty;\n\u2022changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions on sales;\n\u2022the effects of any anti-American sentiments on our brands or sales of our products;\n\u2022increased difficulty in ensuring compliance by employees, agents and contractors with our policies as well as with the laws of multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, local international environmental, health and safety laws, and increasingly complex regulations relating to the conduct of international commerce;\n\u2022increased difficulty in controlling and monitoring foreign operations from the United States, including increased difficulty in identifying and recruiting qualified personnel for our foreign operations; and\n\u2022increased difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations or international sales.\nAn adverse change in any of these conditions could have a negative effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur sales could be adversely impacted by the disruption or cessation of sales by other bike component manufacturers or if other bike component manufacturers enter into the specialty bike component market.\nMost of the bikes incorporating our suspension products also utilize products and components manufactured by other bike component manufacturers. If such component manufacturers were to cease selling their products and components on a stand-alone basis, their sales are disrupted, or their competitive market position or reputation is diminished, customers could migrate to competitors that sell complementary bike products which we do not sell. Moreover, such bike component manufacturers could begin manufacturing bike suspension products, wheels, or cranks, or bundle their bike components with suspension products, wheels or cranks manufactured by competitors. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our sales could decrease and our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nWe have been and may become subject to intellectual property disputes that could cause us to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit us from selling our products.\nAs we develop new products or attempt to utilize our brands in connection with new products, we seek to avoid infringing the valid patents and other intellectual property rights of our competitors. However, from time to time, third parties have alleged, or may allege in the future, that our products and/or trademarks infringe upon their proprietary rights. We will evaluate any such claims and, where appropriate, may obtain or seek to obtain licenses or other business arrangements. To date, there have been no significant interruptions in our business as a result of any claims of infringement, and we do not hold patent infringement insurance. Any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive, time consuming to defend and distract management from our business. Moreover, if our products or brands are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, we may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology or associated intellectual property rights on acceptable terms. A court determination that our brands, products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes or preclude our ability to use certain brands. In most circumstances, we are not indemnified for our use of a licensor\u2019s intellectual property, if such intellectual property is found to be infringing. Any of the foregoing results could cause us to, and we could incur substantial costs to, redesign our products or defend legal actions, and such costs could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, our reputation and sales could be adversely affected.\nIntellectual property is an important component of our business. We patent our proprietary technologies related to vehicle suspension and other products in the U.S. and various foreign patent offices. Additionally, we have registered or have applied for trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and a number of foreign countries, including the marks FOX\u00ae, FOX RACING SHOX\u00ae, RACE FACE\u00ae and REDEFINE YOUR LIMITS\u00ae, to be utilized with certain goods and services. When appropriate, we may from time to time assert our rights against those who infringe on our patents, trademarks, trade dress, or other intellectual property. We may not, however, be successful in enforcing our patents or asserting trademark, trade name or trade dress protection with respect to our brand names and our product designs, and third parties may seek to oppose or challenge our patents or trademark registrations. Further, these legal efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of suspension products by those infringing. In addition, our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents, and even issued patents may be contested, circumvented or invalidated and may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages. If our efforts to develop and enforce our intellectual property are unsuccessful, or if a third party misappropriates our rights, this may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. Furthermore, other competitors may be able to successfully produce products which imitate certain of our products without infringing upon any of our patents, trademarks or trade dress. The failure to prevent or limit infringements and imitations, could have a permanent negative impact on the pricing of our products or reduce our product sales and product margins, even if we are ultimately successful in limiting the distribution of a product that infringes our rights, which in turn may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we enter into non-disclosure agreements with employees, OEMs, distributors and others to protect our confidential information and trade secrets, we may be unable to prevent such parties from breaching these agreements with us and using our intellectual property in an unauthorized manner. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are unsuccessful, or if a third party misappropriates our rights this may adversely affect our business. Defending our intellectual property rights can be very expensive and time consuming, and there is no assurance that we will be successful.\nIf we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may manufacture insufficient or excess quantities or our manufacturing costs could increase, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe plan our manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for our products. In the OEM channel, our forecasts are based in large part on the number of our product specifications for new bikes and powered vehicles and on projections from our OEM customers. In the aftermarket channel, our forecasts are based partially on discussions with our dealers and distributors as well as our own assessment of markets. If we incorrectly forecast demand we may incur capacity issues in our manufacturing plant and supply chain, increased material costs, increased freight costs, additional overtime, and costs associated with excess inventory, all of which in turn adversely impact our cost of sales and our gross margin. Economic weakness and uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries may make accurate forecasting particularly challenging.\nIn the future, if actual demand for our products exceeds forecasted demand, the margins on our incremental sales in excess of anticipated sales may be lower due to temporary higher costs, which could result in a decrease in our overall margins. While we generally manufacture our products upon receipt of customer orders, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for our products and we have already manufactured the products or committed to purchase materials in support of forecasted demand, we could be forced to hold excess inventories. In short, either excess or insufficient production due to inaccurate forecasting could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nProduct recalls, and significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty costs and claims have had, and in the future could have, a material adverse impact on our business.\nUnless otherwise required by law, we generally provide a limited warranty for our products for a one or two year period beginning on: (i) in the case of OEM sales, the date the bike or powered vehicle is purchased from an authorized OEM where our product is incorporated as original equipment on the purchased bike or powered vehicle; or (ii) in the case of aftermarket sales, the date the product is originally purchased from an authorized dealer. From time to time, our customers may negotiate for longer or different warranty coverage. In the ordinary course of business, we incur warranty costs and reserve against such costs in our financial statements. However, there is a risk that we could experience higher than expected warranty costs if we become aware of an underperforming product. For example, in 2012 we increased our reserve and included additional costs of approximately $1.8 million to reflect the costs of repairing or replacing certain dampers in our suspension products and experienced other related costs of approximately $1.0 million. We may in the future encounter similar situations and be forced to make other adjustments to our warranty reserves or incur costs in excess of these reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may also be required to or voluntarily participate in recalls involving our products or components if any prove to be defective. For example, during calendar year 2013, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain model year 2013 32 and 34 Evolution Series suspension forks having 120 mm - 160 mm of travel with certain dampers manufactured by us between March 1, 2012 and November 30, 2012. In addition to the direct costs related to this or other recalls we may be forced to undertake in the future, such events could adversely affect our brand image and have a negative effect on our relationships with our OEMs, sponsored athletes and race teams, or otherwise have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nAn adverse determination in any material product liability claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nThe use of our products by consumers, often under extreme conditions, exposes us to risks associated with product liability claims. If our products are defective or used incorrectly by our customers, bodily injury, property damage or other injury, including death, may result and could give rise to product liability claims against us, which could adversely affect our brand image or reputation. We have encountered product liability claims in the past and carry product liability insurance to help protect us against the costs of such claims, although our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses. Any losses that we may suffer from any liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility places operating restrictions on us and creates default risks.\nThe Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility contains covenants that place restrictions on our operating activities. These covenants, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders or redeem our stock;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or permit additional encumbrances on our assets; and\n\u2022make acquisitions or complete mergers or sales of assets, or engage in new businesses.\nThese restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility, it could constitute an event of default and our lenders could declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings when due, our lenders could sell the collateral securing our credit facilities, which constitutes substantially all of our assets.\nOur outstanding indebtedness under our secured credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates and could cause our interest expense to increase and decrease cash available for operations and other purposes.\nIn connection with our purchase of the business of Sport Truck in March 2014, we entered into the Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility, which provided a maturing secured Term Loan in the principal amount of $50.0 million. On December 12, 2014, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility. The First Amendment increased the Term Loan by the principal amount of $30.0 million to a total of $56.8 million, subject to quarterly amortization payments, and extended the maturity of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility through December 12, 2019. Borrowings under our Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility bear interest on a variable rate which increases and decreases based upon changes in the underlying interest rate and/or our leverage ratio. Any such increases in the interest rate or increases of our borrowings under the Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility will increase our interest expense.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $48.7 million of indebtedness, bearing interest at a variable rate, outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2013 Credit Facility. Recent interest rates in the United States have been at historically low levels, and any increase in these rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our funds available for operations and other purposes. Although from time to time we may enter into agreements to hedge a portion of our interest rate exposure, these agreements may be costly and may not protect against all interest rate fluctuations. Accordingly, we may experience material increases in our interest expense as a result of increases in interest rate levels generally. Based on the $48.7 million of variable interest rate indebtedness that was outstanding as of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rate would have resulted in an approximately $0.5 million change to our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe are subject to certain risks in our manufacturing and in the testing of our products.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 1,500 full-time employees worldwide, a large percentage of which work at our manufacturing facilities. Our business involves complex manufacturing processes that can be inherently dangerous. Although we employ safety procedures in the design and operation of our facilities, there is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities. Also, prior to the introduction of new products, our employees test the products under rigorous conditions, which involve the risk of injury or death. Any accident could result in manufacturing or product delays, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend litigation can be significant. As a result, the costs to defend any action or the potential liability resulting from any such accident or death or arising out of any other litigation, and any negative publicity associated therewith, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive United States federal and state, foreign and international safety, environmental, employment practices and other government regulations that may require us to incur expenses or modify product offerings in order to maintain compliance with such regulation, which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations promulgated by the United States federal and state governments, as well as foreign and international regulatory authorities. Although we believe that our products, policies and processes comply with applicable safety, environmental, and other standards and related regulations, future regulations may require additional safety standards that would require additional expenses and/or modification of product offerings in order to maintain such compliance. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines, increased expenses to modify our products and harm to our reputation, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMoreover, certain of our customer contracts require us to comply with the standards of voluntary standard-setting organizations, such as the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Highway Safety Administration, and European Committee for Standardization (CEN). Failure to comply with the voluntary requirements of such organizations could result in the loss of certain customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to employment practice laws and regulations and as such are exposed to litigation risks.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating employment practices, including wage and hour, wrongful termination and discrimination. Complying with such laws and regulations, and defending against allegations of our failure to comply (including meritless allegations), can be expensive and time consuming. We believe that our policies and processes comply with applicable employment standards and related regulations, however, we are subject to risks of litigation by employees and others which might involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination, misclassification of independent contractors as employees, wrongful termination and other concerns, which could require additional expenditures.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulation and potential exposure for environmental costs and liabilities.\nOur operations, facilities and properties are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include those relating to the use, generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Many of these laws impose strict, retroactive, joint and several liability upon owners and operators of properties, including with respect to environmental matters that occurred prior to the time the party became an owner or operator. In addition, we may have liability with respect to third party sites to which we send waste for disposal. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in significant fines, penalties, costs, liabilities or restrictions on operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, we have been involved in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental, health or safety matters and have in the past incurred expenditures relating to such matters.\nWe believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, additional environmental issues relating to presently known or unknown matters could give rise to currently unanticipated investigation, assessment or expenditures. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as different interpretations of existing laws, more vigorous enforcement by regulators or unanticipated events, could require additional expenditures that may materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal, state, local, foreign and international laws and regulations relating to land-use, noise and air pollution may have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations.\nThe products in our powered vehicles line are used in vehicles which are subject to numerous federal, state, local, foreign and international laws and regulations relating to noise and air-pollution. Powered vehicles, and even bikes, have become subject to laws and regulations prohibiting their use on certain lands and trails. For example, in San Mateo County, California, mountain bikes are not allowed on county trails, and ATV and Side-by-Side riding is not allowed in Zion National Park, among many other national and state parks. In addition, recreational snowmobiling has been restricted in some national parks and federal lands in Canada, the United States and other countries. If more of these laws and regulations are passed and the users of our products lose convenient locations to ride their mountain bikes and powered vehicles, our sales could decrease and our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nFuel shortages, or high prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on the use of powered vehicles that use our products.\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of the powered vehicles that use our products. There can be no assurance that the supply of these fuels will continue uninterrupted, that rationing will not be imposed or that the price of or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. Shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel and substantial increases in the price of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our powered vehicle product category in the future, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe do not control our suppliers or OEMs, or require them to comply with a formal code of conduct, and actions that they might take could harm our reputation and sales.\nWe do not control our suppliers or OEMs or their labor, environmental or other practices. A violation of labor, environmental, intellectual property or other laws by our suppliers or OEMs, or a failure of these parties to follow generally accepted ethical business practices, could create negative publicity and harm our reputation. In addition, we may be required to seek alternative suppliers or OEMs if these violations or failures were to occur. We do not inspect or audit compliance by our suppliers or OEMs with these laws or practices, and we do not require our suppliers or OEMs or licensees to comply with a formal code of conduct. Any conduct or actions that our suppliers could take could reduce demand for our products, harm our ability to meet demand or harm our reputation, brand image, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for our materials and component parts for some of our products, and the loss of any of these suppliers or an increase in cost of raw materials could harm our business.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain components. If our current suppliers, in particular the minority of those which are \"single-source\" suppliers, are unable to timely fulfill orders, or if we are required to transition to other suppliers, we could experience significant production delays or disruption to our business. We define a single-source supplier as a supplier from which we purchase all of a particular raw material or input used in our manufacturing operations, although other suppliers are available from which to purchase the same raw material or input or an equivalent substitute. We do not maintain long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers and instead purchase these components on a purchase order basis. As a result, we cannot force any supplier to sell us the necessary components we use in creating our products and we could face significant supply disruptions should they refuse to do so. As the majority of our bike component manufacturing occurs in Taiwan, we could experience difficulties locating qualified suppliers geographically located closer to these facilities. Furthermore, such suppliers could experience difficulties in providing us with some or all of the materials we require, which could result in disruptions in our manufacturing operations. If we experience difficulties with our suppliers or manufacturing delays caused by our suppliers, whether in connection with our manufacturing operations in the United States or in Taiwan, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nIn addition, we purchase various raw materials in order to manufacture our products. The main commodity items purchased for production include aluminum, magnesium, steel and carbon. Historically, price fluctuations for these components and raw materials have not had a material impact on our business. In the future, however, if we experience material increases in the price of components or raw materials and are unable to pass on those increases to our customers, or there are shortages in the availability of such component parts or raw materials, it could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to our various single-source suppliers, we also rely on one \"sole-source\" supplier, Miyaki Corporation, or Miyaki. We define a sole-source supplier as a supplier of a raw material or input for which there is no other supplier of the same product or an equivalent substitute. Miyaki is the exclusive producer of the Kashima coating for our suspension component tubes. As part of our agreement with Miyaki, we have been granted the exclusive right to use the trademark \"KASHIMACOAT\" on products comprising the aluminum finished parts for suspension components (e.g., tubes) and on related sales and marketing material worldwide, subject to certain exclusions. Although we believe we could obtain other coatings of comparable utility from other sources if necessary, we could no longer obtain this specific Kashima coating or use the trademark \"KASHIMACOAT\" if Miyaki were to stop supplying us with this coating. The need to replace the Kashima coating could temporarily disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business.\nThe SEC rules regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies require ongoing due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, or the DRC, or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC. As a public company, we are required to comply with the reporting obligations annually. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the origin of conflict minerals in our products. The effect of such rules on customer, supplier and/or consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As a result, we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply. We may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges if our due diligence procedures do not enable us to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or to determine if such conflict minerals are conflict-free. Accordingly, these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe transition of a majority of the manufacturing of our bike suspension component products to our facility in Taiwan may negatively impact our brand image and consumer loyalty, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nDuring 2015, we transitioned the majority of the manufacturing of our bike suspension component products to our facility in Taiwan. No assurances can be given that consumers will not be adversely influenced by the fact that such products will no longer be manufactured in the United States or that consumers and OEM customers may not otherwise perceive that the quality of our products is lowered as a result of the fact that the majority are manufactured overseas. Such perceptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may incur higher employee costs in the future.\nWe maintain a self-insured healthcare plan for our US based employees. We have insurance coverage in place for individual claims above a specified amount in any year. Inflation in healthcare costs, as well as additional costs we may incur as a result of current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, could significantly increase our employee healthcare costs in the future. Continued increases in our healthcare costs could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe rely on increasingly complex information systems for management of our manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions. If our information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in our operations, our business could suffer.\nAll of our major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon our complex information systems. Our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things:\n\u2022earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters;\n\u2022power loss, computer systems failure, internet and telecommunications or data network failure; and\n\u2022hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.\nAny damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of our information systems to perform as expected could disrupt our operations, reduce our efficiency, delay our fulfillment of customer orders or require significant unanticipated expenditures to correct, and thereby have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn May 2015, we began the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The new ERP will be phased in over the next few fiscal years beginning in fiscal 2016. ERP implementations are complex and time consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. Any such transformation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems or cost overruns during the ERP implementation process, or if the ERP system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect.\nAdditionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected.\nWe could be negatively impacted by cyber security attacks.\nWe use a variety of information technology systems in the ordinary course of business, which are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and cyber-attacks, including cyber-attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to our propriety or sensitive information, and ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats. The procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cyber security incidents. The results of these incidents could include misstated financial data, theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property, liability for disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, litigation and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cybersecurity incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.\nOur operations may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if they are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack.\nInformation technology systems are critically important to operating our business. We rely on information technology systems to manage business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of any of the information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nWe have grown and may continue to grow in the future through acquisitions. Growth by acquisitions involves risks and we may not be able to effectively integrate businesses we acquire or we may not be able to identify or consummate any future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe intend to selectively evaluate additional acquisitions in the future. Any acquisitions that we might make are subject to various risks and uncertainties and could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks include the inability to integrate effectively the operations, products, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies (some of which may be spread out in different geographic regions), the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or operating synergies, the earn-outs we may contractually obligate ourselves to pay, and the risk we may not be able to effectively manage our operations at an increased scale of operations resulting from such acquisitions. In the event we do complete acquisitions in the future, such acquisitions could affect our cash flows and net income as we expend funds, increase indebtedness and incur additional expenses in connection with pursuing acquisitions. We may also issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. We may not be able to identify or consummate any future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have significant earn-out payment obligations relating to the acquisitions of the businesses of Sport Truck and Race Face/Easton, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2014, we acquired the business of Sport Truck for approximately $40.8 million. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement for the acquisition, we will be obligated to make additional earn-out payments up to an aggregate of approximately $18.2 million based upon the achievement of certain EBITDA (as defined in the acquisition agreement) performance goals for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the recorded fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition on Sport Truck was $12.7 million, based on the application of the Black-Scholes model to management\u2019s financial projections.\nIf, in the future, management's estimation techniques indicate an increase to the contingent consideration liability or if higher EBITDA (as defined in the acquisition agreement) for any period is actually achieved, we will need to accrue and pay additional amounts. Such additional accrual along with the payment of the contingent consideration could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 12, 2014, we acquired the businesses of Race Face/Easton for approximately $29.9 million U.S. Dollars. The terms of the asset purchase agreement included a potential earn-out opportunity of up to a maximum of approximately $14.1 million U.S. Dollars. In November 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement to remove the performance-based financial targets associated with the earn-out and guarantee the maximum earn-out amount payable in 2016 and 2017, subject to conditions including continued employment by the Race Face / Easton Chief Executive. In accounting for the acquisition of Race Face/Easton, the earn-out payments have been excluded from the consideration paid. We recognize the estimated value of the earn-out liability on a ratable basis as services are performed under the employment obligation. Our recognition of the earn-out liability and the payment of amounts due could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly variations in our sales, which could make our operating results difficult to predict and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial quarterly variations in our sales and net income. Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate, in some cases significantly, as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the timing of new product releases or other significant announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022new advertising initiatives;\n\u2022fluctuations in raw materials and component costs; and\n\u2022changes in our practices with respect to building inventory.\nAs a result of these quarterly fluctuations, comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and may not be accurate indicators of our future performance. Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may differ from the expectations of market analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. We also believe that the seasonal nature of our business may have been overshadowed over each of the past few years due to the rapid growth in sales we have experienced during the same period.\nOur beliefs regarding the future growth of the performance suspension and ride dynamics product market are supported by qualitative data and limited sources and may not be reliable. A reduction or lack of continued growth in the popularity of high-end bikes, bikes or powered vehicles or in the number of consumers who are willing to pay premium prices for well-designed performance-oriented equipment in the markets in which we sell our products could adversely affect our product sales and profits, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe generate virtually all of our revenues from sales of performance suspension and ride dynamics products. Our beliefs regarding the outlook of the performance suspension product market come from qualitative data and limited sources, which may not be reliable. If our beliefs regarding the opportunities in the market for our products are incorrect or the number of consumers who we believe are willing to pay premium prices for well-designed performance-oriented equipment in the markets in which we sell our products does not increase, or declines, we may fail to achieve future growth and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you pay for the shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Since our IPO in 2013, our stock price has fluctuated between $20.75 and $13.35 per share and such volatility may continue in the future. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include:\n\u2022variations in our operating results or those of our competitors;\n\u2022new product or other significant announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in our product mix;\n\u2022changes in consumer preferences;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022the gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions as well as conditions affecting our industry in particular; and\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us, our significant stockholders or our directors or executive officers.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price fluctuations. Fluctuations in the stock market generally or with respect to companies in our industry could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class actions filed against them. A suit filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert management\u2019s attention.\nFuture sales of our shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of December 31, 2015, we had 37,025,076 shares of common stock outstanding of which 17,861,485 are freely tradable in the public market. As of December 31, 2015, 19,163,591 shares of common stock outstanding were held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates and are subject to volume and manner of sale limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAfter our IPO, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock that we may issue under our equity plans. As a result, all such shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to any vesting or contractual lock-up agreements.\nIn March, 2015 we filed a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to enable us, and certain of our stockholders, to quickly go to market should we, or certain of our stockholders, wish to sell our common stock, or additionally, in our case, certain other debt instruments\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 90,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 37,025,076 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition or otherwise. If any of these additional shares described are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory \"say-on-pay\" and \"say-when-on-pay\" votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Exchange Act.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes unfavorable research about our business or our industry, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nCompass and our directors and officers and insiders have substantial control over us and will be able to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Compass beneficially owns approximately 40.8% of our outstanding common stock. Compass, our directors and executive officers, and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 51.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and approval of any merger, consolidation, or sale of all, or substantially all, of our assets or other significant corporate transactions. In addition, Compass continues to have input on all matters before our board of directors because our director Elias Sabo is affiliated with Compass. Compass may also delay or prevent a change of control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders. So long as Compass or any of its affiliates continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding common stock, they will continue to be able to significantly influence our decisions.\nIn addition, Compass is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that may compete directly or indirectly with us. Compass may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, or our Charter Documents, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022require that directors be removed from office only for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022from and after the date that Compass and its affiliates no longer collectively beneficially own (as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, or the Trigger Date, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, our Chairperson of the board of directors, our Lead Director (if we do not have a Chairperson or the Chairperson is disabled), our Chief Executive Officer or our President (in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer) or, until the Trigger Date, Compass;\n\u2022from and after the Trigger Date, require supermajority stockholder voting for our stockholders to effect certain amendments to our Charter Documents; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing other matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any broad range of business combinations with a stockholder owning 15% or more of such corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years following the date on which such stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder. In order for us to consummate a business combination with an interested stockholder within three years of the date on which the stockholder became interested, either (i) the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming interested must be approved by our board of directors prior to the date the stockholder became interested, (ii) the interested stockholder must own at least 85% of our outstanding voting stock at the time the transaction commences (excluding voting stock owned by directors who are also officers and certain employee stock plans) or (iii) the business combination must be approved by our board of directors and authorized by at least two-thirds of our stockholders (excluding the interested stockholder) at a special or annual meeting (not by written consent). This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Any delay or prevention of a change in control transaction or changes in our board of directors and management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares of our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with certain limited exceptions, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of our company owed to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Charter Documents, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our Charter Documents, or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14097, "SIC": 3751, "TIC": "FOXF"}
