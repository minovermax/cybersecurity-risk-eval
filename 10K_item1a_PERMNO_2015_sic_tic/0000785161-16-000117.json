Some of these risks are described below, and the reader should take such risks into account in evaluating HealthSouth or any investment decision involving HealthSouth. This section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us, our industry, or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors. More detailed information concerning other risk factors as well as those described below is contained in other sections of this annual report.\nReductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third-party payors could adversely affect our Net operating revenues and other operating results.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our Net operating revenues from the Medicare program. See Item 1, Business, \u201cSources of Revenues,\u201d for a table identifying the sources and relative payor mix of our revenues. In addition to many ordinary course reimbursement rate changes that the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), adopts each year as part of its annual rulemaking process for various healthcare provider categories, Congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in laws and regulations governing the healthcare system. Many of these changes have resulted in limitations on the increases in and, in some cases, significant roll-backs or reductions in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs. There can be no assurance that future governmental initiatives will not result in pricing roll-backs or freezes or reimbursement reductions.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as subsequently amended, the \u201c2010 Healthcare Reform Laws\u201d). Many provisions within the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws have impacted or could in the future impact our business, including: (1) Medicare reimbursement reductions, such as reductions to annual market basket updates to providers and reimbursement rate rebasing adjustments; (2) the possible combining, or \u201cbundling,\u201d of reimbursement for a Medicare beneficiary\u2019s episode of care at some point in the future; (3) implementing a voluntary program for accountable care organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d); and (4) creating an Independent Payment Advisory Board.\nFor our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, these laws include reductions in CMS\u2019s annual adjustments to Medicare reimbursement rates by what is commonly known as a \u201cmarket basket update.\u201d In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, CMS makes market basket updates by provider type. The reductions in the annual market basket updates for our hospitals continue through 2019 for each CMS fiscal year, which for us begins October 1, as follows:\n2017-19\n0.2%\n0.75%\nIn addition, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws require the market basket update for our hospitals to be reduced by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis. The productivity adjustments equal the trailing 10-year average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. The productivity adjustment in effect for fiscal year (October 1 to September 30) 2016 is a decrease to the market basket update of 50 basis points.\nFor home health agencies, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws directed CMS to improve home health payment accuracy through rebasing home health payments over four years starting in 2014. The rebasing adjustment for calendar year 2016 (the third year of the four-year phase-in) offset the annual market basket update of 2.3% with a 2.4% reduction. CMS is also implementing a case-mix coding intensity reduction of 90 basis points in 2016. In addition, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws also require an annual home health productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2016, that adjustment is a decrease to the market basket update of 40 basis points.\nFor hospice agencies, the 2010 Healthcare Reform laws require, in addition to an annual productivity adjustment, further reduction of the annual market basket update of 30 basis points for fiscal years through 2019. The hospice productivity adjustment for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2015 was a decrease to the market basket update of 50 basis points.\nOther federal legislation can also have a significant direct impact on our Medicare reimbursement. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided for an automatic 2% reduction of Medicare\nprogram payments. This automatic reduction, known as \u201csequestration,\u201d which began affecting payments received after April 1, 2013, reduced the payments we receive under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the \u201cIRF-PPS\u201d) resulting in a net year-over-year decrease in our Net operating revenues of approximately $9 million in 2014. The effect of sequestration on year-over-year comparisons of Net operating revenues ceased on April 1, 2014. However, each year through 2025, the reimbursement we receive from Medicare, after first taking into account all annual payment adjustments including the market basket update, will be reduced by sequestration unless it is repealed before then.\nAdditionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, and/or further reductions to provider payments. For example, on April 16, 2015, the President signed into law the Medicare Access and CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) Reauthorization Act, which repealed the statutory mechanism providing for annual automatic adjustments to the Medicare physician fee schedule using a sustainable growth rate formula that has historically resulted in annual deep cuts to physician reimbursement rates, a consequence of which has been the so-called \u201cdoc fixes\u201d passed by Congress annually since 2002 to override those automatic adjustments. The primary impact of this act on us is a mandated market basket update of +1.0% in 2018 for rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies.\nIn October 2014, the President signed into law the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the \u201cIMPACT Act\u201d). The IMPACT Act was developed on a bi-partisan basis by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees and incorporated feedback from healthcare providers and provider organizations that responded to the Committees\u2019 solicitation of post-acute payment reform ideas and proposals. It directs the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), in consultation with healthcare stakeholders, to implement standardized data collection processes for post-acute quality and outcome measures. Although the IMPACT Act does not specifically call for the development of a new post-acute payment system, we believe this act will lay the foundation for possible future post-acute payment policies that would be based on patients\u2019 medical conditions and other clinical factors rather than the setting where the care is provided. It will create additional data reporting requirements for our hospitals and home health and hospice agencies. The precise details of these new reporting requirements, including timing and content, will be developed and implemented by CMS through the regulatory process that we expect will take place over the next several years. We cannot quantify the potential effects of the IMPACT Act on us.\nEach year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (\u201cMedPAC\u201d), an independent agency, advises Congress on issues affecting Medicare and makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the IRF-PPS, the home health prospective payment system (\u201cHH-PPS\u201d) and the hospice prospective payment system. MedPAC also provides comments to CMS on proposed rules, including the prospective payment system rules. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance Congress will adopt MedPAC\u2019s recommendations in a given year. However, MedPAC\u2019s recommendations have, and may in the future, become the basis for subsequent legislative or regulatory action.\nIn connection with CMS\u2019s final rulemaking for the 2016 HH-PPS, MedPAC recommended, among other things, legislative changes to make the rebasing cuts larger in size to further reduce margins and the overhaul of the HH-PPS to pay providers based on patient characteristics in lieu of the number of therapy services furnished. MedPAC also recommended that CMS not provide for a market basket update in the 2016 IRF-PPS. This year, MedPAC approved recommendations to eliminate the market basket update for each of the IRF-PPS, the HH-PPS and the Hospice-PPS for 2017.\nWe cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives, Medicare payment reductions, or post-acute care reforms, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or effect of any initiatives or reductions. Those initiatives or reductions would be in addition to many ordinary course reimbursement rate changes that CMS adopts each year as part of the market basket update rulemaking process for various provider categories. There can be no assurance future governmental action will not result in substantial changes to, or material reductions in, our reimbursements. In any given year, the net effect of the changes may result in a decrease in our reimbursement rate, and that decrease may occur at a time when our expenses are increasing. As a result, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of how we are reimbursed by Medicare, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulatory and Reimbursement Challenges\u201d and \u201cSources of Revenues-Medicare Reimbursement.\u201d\nIn addition, there are increasing pressures, including as a result of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, from many third-party payors to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services. Our relationships with managed care and nongovernmental third-party payors, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations, are generally governed by negotiated agreements. These agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services. We could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third-party payors.\nThe ongoing evolution of the healthcare delivery system, including alternative payment models and value-based purchasing initiatives, in the United States may significantly affect our business and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry in general is facing uncertainty associated with the efforts, primarily arising from initiatives such as payment bundling and ACOs included in the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, to identify and implement workable coordinated care and integrated payment delivery models. In a coordinated care delivery model, hospitals, physicians, and other care providers are reimbursed in a fashion meant to encourage the provision of coordinated healthcare on a more efficient, patient-centered basis. These providers are then paid based on the overall value of the services they provide to a patient rather than the number of services they provide. While this is consistent with our goal and proven track record of being a high-quality, cost-effective provider, broad-based implementation of a new delivery model would represent a significant evolution or transformation of the healthcare industry, which may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws directed HHS to examine the feasibility of bundling, including conducting a voluntary, multi-year bundling pilot program to test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies. There are four project types or models: acute care only, acute/post-acute, post-acute only (Model 3), and acute and physician services. In the initial non-risk bearing stage of the bundling program (Phase 1), pilot participants received data from CMS on care patterns and engaged in shared learning in how to improve care. The second phase (Phase 2) requires participants, pending contract finalization and completion of the standard CMS program integrity reviews, to take on financial risk for episodes of care.\nEight of our hospitals began participating in Phase 2, the \u201cat-risk\u201d phase, of Model 3 of CMS\u2019 voluntary Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (\u201cBPCI\u201d) initiative in 2015. We also have several hospitals that have signed participation agreements with acute care providers participating in Model 2 of the BPCI initiative. Ten of Encompass\u2019s home health agencies began participating in Phase 2 of Model 3 in 2014. In July 2015, 42 additional home health agencies began participating in Phase 2.\nSimilarly, CMS has established per the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws several separate ACO programs, the largest of which is the Medicare Shared Savings Program (\u201cMSSP\u201d), a voluntary ACO program in which hospitals, physicians, and other care providers pursue the delivery of coordinated healthcare on a more efficient, patient-centered basis. Conceptually, ACOs receive a portion of any savings generated above a certain threshold from care coordination as long as benchmarks for the quality of care are maintained. Under the MSSP, there are two different ACO tracks from which participants can choose. The first track allows ACOs to share only in the savings. The second track requires ACOs to share in any savings and losses but offers ACOs a greater share of any savings realized than the first track offers. The ACO rules adopted by CMS are extremely complex and remain subject to further refinement by CMS. According to CMS, there are 477 ACOs serving almost 8.9 million beneficiaries as of January 2016. We continue to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, appropriate ACO participation opportunities for our hospitals, home health agencies, and patients. To date, we have signed two ACO participation agreements for our hospitals. Encompass has also partnered as the exclusive preferred home health provider with Premier PHC\u2122, an ACO serving approximately 20,000 Medicare patients.\nIn January 2015, HHS announced it set various goals with respect to tying Medicare reimbursements to alternative payment models and value-based purchasing. Specifically, HHS set goals of tying 30 percent of traditional, or fee-for-service, Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, such as ACOs or bundled payment arrangements, by the end of 2016 and tying 50 percent of payments to those models by the end of 2018. HHS also set goals of tying 85 and 90 percent of traditional Medicare payments to quality or value by the end of 2016 and 2018, respectively, through programs such as those that include financial incentives for reducing acute care hospital readmissions.\nOn November 16, 2015, CMS issued its final rule establishing the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (\u201cCJR\u201d) payment model. This mandatory model holds acute care hospitals accountable for the quality of care they deliver to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for lower extremity joint replacements (i.e., knees and hips) from surgery through recovery. Through the five-year payment model, healthcare providers in 67 geographic areas would continue to be paid under existing Medicare payment systems. However, the hospital where the joint replacement takes place would be held accountable for the quality and costs of care for the entire episode of care - from the time of the surgery through 90 days after discharge. Depending on the quality and cost performance during the entire episode, the hospital may receive an additional payment or be required to repay Medicare for a portion of the episode costs. As a result, the acute care hospitals are incented to work with physicians and post-acute care providers to ensure beneficiaries receive the coordinated care they need in an efficient manner.\nThe bundling and ACO initiatives have served as motivating factors for regulators and healthcare industry participants to identify and implement workable coordinated care delivery models. Broad-based implementation of a new delivery model would represent a significant transformation for us and the healthcare industry generally. The nature and timing of the evolution or transformation of the current healthcare system to coordinated care delivery and payment models is uncertain and will likely remain so for some time. The development of new delivery and payment systems will almost certainly take significant time and\nexpense. Many of the alternative approaches being explored may not work or could change substantially prior to a nationwide implementation.\nAdditionally, as the number and types of bundling and ACO models increase, the number of Medicare beneficiaries who are treated in one of the models increases. Our willingness and ability to participate in coordinated care delivery and alternative payment models and the referral patterns of other providers participating in those models may affect our access to Medicare patients who would benefit from treatment in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals or from the services Encompass offers. For further discussion of new coordinated care delivery and payment models, the associated challenges, and our efforts to respond to them, see the \u201cExecutive Overview-Key Challenges-Changes to Our Operating Environment Resulting from Healthcare Reform\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther legislative and regulatory initiatives and changes affecting the industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to the legislative and regulatory actions that directly affect our reimbursement rates or further the evolution of the current healthcare delivery system, other legislative and regulatory changes, including as a result of ongoing healthcare reform, affect healthcare providers like us from time to time. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws establish the Independent Payment Advisory Board appointed by the President that is charged with presenting proposals to Congress to reduce Medicare expenditures upon the occurrence of Medicare expenditures exceeding a certain level. This board will have broad authority to develop new Medicare policies (including changes to provider reimbursement). In general, unless Congress acts to block the proposals of this board, CMS will implement the policy recommendations. However, due to the market basket reductions that are also part of these laws, certain healthcare providers, such as our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, will not be subject to payment reduction proposals developed by this board and presented to Congress until 2020. While most of our operations may not be subject to its payment reduction proposals for a period of time, based on the scope of this board\u2019s directive to reduce Medicare expenditures and the significance of Medicare as a payor to us, other decisions made by this board may adversely impact our results of operations, including reductions in the payment for home health services. As of December 31, 2015, the Independent Payment Advisory Board members have not been appointed.\nThe 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws include other provisions that could adversely affect us as well. They include the expansion of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and the False Claims Act that, when combined with other recent federal initiatives, are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally. Changes include increased resources for enforcement, lowered burden of proof for the government in healthcare fraud matters, expanded definition of claims under the False Claims Act, enhanced penalties, and increased rewards for relators in successful prosecutions. CMS may also suspend payment for claims prospectively if, in its opinion, credible allegations of fraud exist. The initial suspension period may be up to P180D days. However, the payment suspension period can be extended almost indefinitely if the matter is under investigation by the HHS Office of Inspector General (the \u201cHHS-OIG\u201d) or the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d). Any such suspension would adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSome states in which we operate have also undertaken, or are considering, healthcare reform initiatives that address similar issues. While many of the stated goals of other federal and state reform initiatives are consistent with our own goal to provide care that is high-quality and cost-effective, legislation and regulatory proposals may lower reimbursements, increase the cost of compliance, decrease patient volumes, and otherwise adversely affect our business. We cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be enacted, implemented or amended, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us.\nOn October 29, 2015, CMS issued a proposed rule relating to requirements for discharge planning for hospitals and home health agencies as called for by the IMPACT Act. The proposed rule would revise the discharge planning requirements applicable to our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and Encompass home health agencies.\nCMS proposes to require hospitals (including inpatient rehabilitation facilities (\u201cIRFs\u201d)) to have a discharge planning process that focuses on patients\u2019 goals and preferences and on preparing them and, as appropriate, their caregivers, to be active partners in their post-discharge care. For our hospitals, the proposed rule would require development of standardized procedures pertaining to the development and finalization of unique discharge plans for all patients. CMS proposes that discharge instructions must be provided at the time of discharge to patients, or the patient\u2019s caregiver or both, who are discharged home or who are referred to other post-acute care services, and that any post-discharge practitioners or providers must receive the patient\u2019s discharge instructions at the time of discharge, including the patient\u2019s discharge summary within 48 hours of discharge and any test results within 24 hours of availability.\nFor home health agencies, the proposed rule includes several new requirements. The discharge planning process would require the regular re-evaluation of patients to identify changes requiring modification of the discharge plan. The physician responsible for a patient\u2019s plan of care would have to be involved in the ongoing establishment of the discharge plan. Home health agencies must also send certain specified medical and other information to the post-discharge facility or health care practitioner. The proposed rule would likely require the modification of existing discharge forms and reports, and patient visits may need to be extended in order to accommodate patient education. If adopted as proposed, we would expect to incur additional one-time and recurring expenses to comply, but at this time, we cannot predict what the final requirements will be or the timing or effect of those requirements.\nUnder the authorization granted in the IMPACT Act, in January 2016, CMS released draft specifications for new Medicare spending per beneficiary measures to be tracked and reported by CMS for each IRF, skilled nursing facility, long-term acute care hospital and home health agency. The intent of tracking and publishing this data is to evaluate a given provider\u2019s payment efficiency relative to the efficiency of the national median provider in that provider\u2019s post-acute segment. CMS believes this measure will encourage improved efficiency and coordination of care in the post-acute setting by holding providers accountable for Medicare resource use during an episode of care. However, the proposed measures do not take into account patient outcomes. CMS has not proposed to compare payment efficiency across provider segments. Per the IMPACT Act, these spending per beneficiary measures must be finalized and effective by October 1, 2016 for IRFs and by January 1, 2017 for home health agencies.\nIn January 2016, CMS extended a temporary moratorium on the enrollment of new home health agencies and branch locations. CMS established the moratorium in July 2013, and the latest extension is set to expire in July 2016 unless it is again extended. It applies to six metropolitan areas, including Houston and Dallas where Encompass has several locations.\nOn February 5, 2016, CMS published a notice in the federal register detailing two proposed home health regulatory initiatives: 1) establishment of a new demonstration project under which it would require home health providers to seek prior authorization before submitting claims for services in Florida, Texas, Illinois, Michigan, and Massachusetts and 2) an extension of the Medicare probable fraud pilot. In the demonstration project, CMS proposes to have Medicare contractors collect additional information from home health providers submitting claims in order to determine proper payment or if there is a suspicion of fraud. In the pilot, CMS proposes to collect information from home health agencies, referring physicians and patients in a random national sampling of claims to establish a baseline estimate of probable fraud in Medicare home health billings.\nAs discussed above, MedPAC makes healthcare policy recommendations to Congress and provides comments to CMS on Medicare payment related issues. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC\u2019s recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance Congress will adopt any given MedPAC recommendation. For example, in January 2016, MedPAC released materials discussing several possible changes, some of which MedPAC has advocated previously, to various post-acute payment systems. One of the possible changes reported on was the development of a unified payment system for all post-acute care in lieu of separate systems for IRFs, skilled nursing facilities, long-term acute care hospitals, and home health agencies. MedPAC expects to issue a report on this in April 2016, including providing details of alternative models that could be used to test a unified payment system, and has stated it would expect IRF payments to decrease under a unified payment system. Another possible change reported on was an increase of outlier payments to be funded by reductions to non-outlier payments rates under the IRF-PPS.\nWe cannot predict what legislative or regulatory reforms or changes, if any, will ultimately be enacted, or the timing or effect any of those changes or reforms will have on us. If enacted, they may be challenging for all providers and have the effect of limiting Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to healthcare services and could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of healthcare reform and other factors affecting reimbursement for our services, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulatory and Reimbursement Challenges\u201d and \u201cSources of Revenues-Medicare Reimbursement.\u201d\nQuality reporting requirements may negatively impact the Medicare reimbursement we receive.\nThe focus on alternative payment models and value-based purchasing of healthcare services has, in turn, led to more extensive quality of care reporting requirements. In many cases, the new reporting requirements are linked to reimbursement incentives. For example, under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, CMS established new quality data reporting, effective October 1, 2012, for all IRFs. A facility\u2019s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility\u2019s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in the subsequent Medicare fiscal year. Hospitals began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our hospitals met the reporting deadlines occurring on or before December 31, 2014 resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. Similarly, home health and hospice agencies are also required to submit quality data to CMS each year, and the failure to do so in accordance with the rules will result in a two percentage point reduction in their market basket update. To date, none of Encompass\u2019s home health and hospice agencies have incurred a reduction in their reimbursement rates.\nAs noted above, the IMPACT Act mandated that CMS adopt several new quality reporting measures for the various post-acute provider types. For example, CMS recently adopted six additional IRF quality reporting measures, the reporting of which beginning on October 1, 2016 will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement beginning October 1, 2017. In healthcare generally, the burdens associated with collecting, recording, and reporting quality data are increasing. Home health providers are now subject to tracking and reporting 79 CMS-sanctioned quality reporting measures.\nThe 2016 HH Rule establishes a Home Health Value-Based Purchasing model in nine states, which will include five performance years beginning January 1, 2016 and test whether incentives for better care can improve outcomes in the delivery of home health services. The model would apply a reduction or increase to current home health agency payments, depending on quality performance, made to agencies in Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, Washington, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee. Payment adjustments would be applied on an annual basis, beginning at 3% and increasing to 8% in later years of the initiative.\nThere can be no assurance all of our hospitals and agencies will continue to meet quality reporting requirements in the future which may result in one or more of our hospitals or agencies seeing a reduction in its Medicare reimbursements. Regardless, we, like other healthcare providers, are likely to incur additional expenses in an effort to comply with additional and changing quality reporting requirements.\nCompliance with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to healthcare providers requires substantial time, effort and expense, and if we fail to comply with them, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nHealthcare providers are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:\n\u2022\nlicensure, certification, and accreditation;\n\u2022\npolicies, either at the national or local level, delineating what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement under Medicare (also referred to as coverage requirements);\n\u2022\ncoding and billing for services;\n\u2022\nrequirements of the 60% compliance threshold under the 2007 Medicare Act;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources, including physician self-referral and anti-kickback laws;\n\u2022\nquality of medical care;\n\u2022\nuse and maintenance of medical supplies and equipment;\n\u2022\nmaintenance and security of patient information and medical records;\n\u2022\nacquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances; and\n\u2022\ndisposal of medical and hazardous waste.\nIn the future, changes in these laws or regulations or the manner in which they are enforced could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our hospitals, equipment,\npersonnel, services, capital expenditure programs, operating procedures, and contractual arrangements, as well as the way in which we deliver home health and hospice services. Those changes could also affect reimbursements as well as future training and staffing costs.\nIn addition to specific compliance-related laws and regulations, examples of regulatory changes that can affect our business, beyond direct changes to Medicare reimbursement rates, can be found from time to time in CMS\u2019s annual rulemaking. The final rule for the fiscal year 2010 IRF-PPS implemented new coverage requirements which provided in part that a patient medical record must document a reasonable expectation that, at the time of admission to an IRF, the patient generally required and was able to participate in the intensive rehabilitation therapy services uniquely provided at IRFs. CMS has also taken the position that a patient\u2019s medical file must appropriately document the rationale for the use of group therapies, as opposed to one-on-one therapy. As previously noted, the appropriate utilization of group therapy was a focus of recent HHS-OIG work plans. Beginning on October 1, 2015, a new data collection requirement will go into effect that will capture the minutes and mode (individual, group, concurrent, or co-treatment) of therapy by specialty. CMS plans to use this data to potentially support future rulemaking in this area. Additionally, the final rules for the fiscal years 2014 and 2015 IRF-PPS include changes, effective October 1, 2015, to the list of medical conditions, including a reduction in the number of conditions, that will presumptively count toward the 60% compliance threshold to qualify for reimbursement as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital.\nOf note, the HHS-OIG each year releases a work plan that identifies areas of compliance focus for the coming year. In recent years, HHS-OIG work plans for IRFs have focused on, among other items, the appropriate utilization of concurrent and group therapy and adverse and temporary harm events occurring in IRFs. The 2016 work plan indicates HHS-OIG will focus on appropriate documentation to support claims by IRFs and the home health agencies. For hospice agencies, the 2016 work plan focuses on reviews of beneficiaries\u2019 plans of care and determine whether they meet key requirements and medical records to address concerns that a level of hospice care is being billed when that level of service is not medically necessary.\nAs the recent HHS-OIG work plans demonstrate, the clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of a physician not employed by us, are essential to demonstrating our compliance with various regulatory and reimbursement requirements. For example, to support the determination that a patient\u2019s IRF treatment was reasonable and necessary, the file must contain, among other things, an admitting physician\u2019s assessment of the patient as well as a post-admission assessment by the treating physician and other information from clinicians relating to the plan of care and the therapies being provided. These physicians exercise their independent medical judgment. We and our hospital medical directors, who are independent contractors, provide training to the physicians we work with on a regular basis regarding appropriate documentation. In connection with subsequent payment audits and investigations, there can be no assurance as to what opinion a third party may take regarding the status of patient files or the physicians\u2019 medical judgment evidenced in those files.\nOn March 4, 2013, we received document subpoenas from an office of the HHS-OIG addressed to four of our hospitals. Those subpoenas also requested complete copies of medical records for 100 patients treated at each of those hospitals between September 2008 and June 2012. The investigation is being conducted by the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d). On April 24, 2014, we received document subpoenas relating to an additional seven of our hospitals. The new subpoenas reference substantially similar investigation subject matter as the original subpoenas and request materials from the period January 2008 through December 2013. Two of the four hospitals addressed in the original set of subpoenas have received supplemental subpoenas to cover this new time period. The most recent subpoenas do not include requests for specific patient files. However, in February 2015, the DOJ requested the voluntary production of the medical records of an additional 70 patients, some of whom were treated in hospitals not subject to the subpoenas, and we provided these records.\nAll of the subpoenas are in connection with an investigation of alleged improper or fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid and requests documents and materials relating to practices, procedures, protocols and policies, of certain pre- and post-admissions activities at these hospitals including, among other things, marketing functions, pre-admission screening, post-admission physician evaluations, patient assessment instruments, individualized patient plans of care, and compliance with the Medicare 60% rule. Under the Medicare rule commonly referred to as the \u201c60% rule,\u201d an inpatient rehabilitation hospital must treat 60% or more of its patients from at least one of a specified list of medical conditions in order to be reimbursed at the inpatient rehabilitation hospital payment rates, rather than at the lower acute care hospital payment rates. We are currently unable to predict the timing or outcome of these investigations, and the DOJ has expressly reserved its right to make additional requests.\nAlthough we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial time, effort, and expense in implementing and maintaining training programs as well as internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be required to return portions of reimbursements for discharges deemed after the fact to have not been appropriate under the IRF-PPS. We could also be subjected to other liabilities, including (1) criminal penalties, (2) civil penalties, including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our\nhospitals, and (3) exclusion or suspension of one or more of our hospitals from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs, which, if lengthy in duration and material to us, could potentially trigger a default under our credit agreement. Because Medicare comprises a significant portion of our Net operating revenues, it is important for us to remain compliant with the laws and regulations governing the Medicare program and related matters including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements. As discussed above in connection with the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the federal government has in the last couple of years made compliance enforcement and fighting healthcare fraud top priorities. In the past few years, the DOJ and HHS as well as federal lawmakers have significantly increased efforts to ensure strict compliance with various reimbursement related regulations as well as combat healthcare fraud. The DOJ has pursued and recovered a record amount of taxpayer dollars lost to healthcare fraud. Additionally, the federal government has become increasingly aggressive in asserting that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping represent a violation of the False Claims Act. Human error and oversight in record keeping and documentation, particularly where those activities are the responsibility of non-employees, are always a risk in business, and the healthcare industry and independent physicians are no different.\nReductions in reimbursements, substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation, depending on its nature, could have a material adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.\nReimbursement claims are subject to various audits from time to time and such audits may negatively impact our operations and our cash flows from operations.\nReimbursement claims made by health care providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings, and insurance carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs. As noted above, the clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of a physician not employed by us, is essential to successfully challenging any payment denials. If the physicians working with our patients do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, our risks related to audits and payment denials in general are greater. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and liquidity.\nWith respect to the Medicare program, from which we receive a substantial portion of our revenues, certain of our MACs, under programs known as \u201cwidespread probes,\u201d have conducted pre-payment claim reviews of our Medicare billings and in some cases denied payment for certain diagnosis codes. A substantial majority of the denials we have encountered in these probes derive from one MAC. In connection with recent probes, this MAC has made determinations regarding medical necessity which represent its uniquely restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. We have discussed our objections to those interpretations with both the MAC and CMS. We cannot predict what, if any, changes will result from those discussions.\nCMS has developed and instituted various audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. These audits are in addition to those conducted by existing MACs. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. One type of audit contractor, the Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201dRACs\u201d), receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review claims up to three years from the date a claim was paid, beginning with claims filed on or after October 1, 2007. Beginning May 15, 2015, CMS limited the recovery auditor look back period to six months from the date of service in cases where the hospital submits the claim within three months of the date of service.\nRAC audits of IRFs initially focused on coding errors, but have subsequently been expanded to medical necessity reviews. In connection with CMS approved and announced RACs audits related to IRFs, we received requests in 2014 and 2013 to review certain patient files for discharges occurring from 2010 to 2014. These post-payment RAC audits are focused on medical necessity requirements for admission to IRFs rather than targeting a specific diagnosis code as in previous pre-payment audits. Medical necessity is an assessment by an independent physician of a patient\u2019s ability to tolerate and benefit from intensive multi-disciplinary therapy provided in an IRF setting. To date, the Medicare payments that are subject to these RAC audit requests represent less than 1% of our Medicare patient discharges from 2010 to 2014. We have appealed substantially all RAC denials arising from these audits using the same process we follow for appealing denials of certain diagnosis codes by MACs. CMS has previously operated a demonstration project that expanded the RAC program to include prepayment review of Medicare fee-for-service claims from primarily acute care hospitals. It is unclear whether CMS intends to continue RAC prepayment reviews and if so, what providers and claims would be the focus of those reviews.\nCMS has also established contractors known as the Zone Program Integrity Contractors (\u201cZPICs\u201d). These contractors are successors to the Program Safeguard Contractors and conduct audits with a focus on potential fraud and abuse issues. Like\nthe RACs, the ZPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the DOJ. Unlike RACs, however, ZPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the error.\nAudits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or submitted improper claims in some instances, require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid or disallow reimbursement. Additionally, if the MAC discussed above continues to deny a significant number of claims for certain diagnosis codes, we may experience similar difficulties. As a result, we may suffer reduced profitability, and we may have to elect not to accept patients and conditions we believe can benefit from inpatient rehabilitation. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us.\nOur third-party payors may also, from time to time, request audits of the amounts paid, or to be paid, to us. We could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if the auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to us due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations.\nDelays in the administrative appeals process associated with denied Medicare reimbursement claims may delay or reduce receipt of the related reimbursement amounts for services previously provided.\nOrdinary course Medicare pre-payment denials by MACs, as well as denials resulting from widespread probes and audits, are subject to appeal by providers. We have historically appealed a majority of our denials. For claims we choose to appeal to an administrative law judge, we have historically experienced a greater than 70% success rate. However, the appeals adjudication process established by CMS has encountered significant delays in recent years. For example, most of our appeals heard by an administrative law judge in 2015 related to denials received in 2011 and 2012. We believe the process for resolving individual Medicare payment claims that are denied will continue to take in excess of three years. Additionally, the number of new denials far exceeds the number of appeals resolved in recent years as shown in the following summary of our inpatient rehabilitation segment activity:\nNew Denials\nCollections of Previously Denied Claims\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts for Denial Activity\n(In Millions)\n$79.0\n$15.0\n$20.6\n52.5\n14.1\n14.0\nWe record our estimates for pre-payment denials, including those resulting from widespread probes, and for post-payment audit denials that will ultimately not be collected in the Provision for doubtful accounts. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, \u201cNet Operating Revenues,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Given the continuing or increasing delays along with the increasing number of denials in the backlog, we may experience increases in the Provision for doubtful accounts, decreases in cash flow as a result of increasing accounts receivable, and/or a shift in the patients and conditions we treat, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Although there is legislation proposed in Congress, the goal of which is to reform and improve the Medicare audit and appeals process, we cannot predict what, if any, legislation will be adopted or what, if any, effect that legislation might have on the audit and appeals process.\nChanges in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients could adversely impact our revenues or our profitability.\nMany factors affect pricing of our services and, in turn, our revenues. For example, in the inpatient rehabilitation segment, these factors include, among other things, the treating facility\u2019s urban or rural status, the length of stay, the payor and its applicable rate of reimbursement, and the patient\u2019s medical condition and impairment status (acuity). In 2015, our inpatient rehabilitation segment experienced a shift in payor mix to a slightly larger percentage of Medicaid patients and a shift to a slightly lower average acuity for our patients, both of which adversely affected pricing growth. For additional discussion of these impacts in 2015, see the \u201cSegment Results of Operations-Inpatient Rehabilitation-Net Operating Revenues\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The expansion and growth of Medicaid and insurance exchanges resulting from provisions of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws have increased the number of those patients coming to us. Medicaid reimbursement rates are almost always the lowest among those of our payors, and frequently Medicaid patients come to us with other complicating conditions that make treatment more difficult and costly. Similarly, the insurance coverages offered in the exchanges typically reimburse us at rates lower than we receive under other managed care contracts. While it is not anticipated that Medicaid and insurance exchanges will continue to grow at the rate they have in recent years, we cannot predict whether our payor mix will continue to shift to these lower reimbursement rate payors.\nIn the future, we may also experience shifts in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients that could adversely affect our pricing, revenues or profitability.\nWe face intense competition for patients from other healthcare providers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, fragmented inpatient rehabilitation and home health and hospice industries. Although we are the nation\u2019s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated and discharged, revenues, and number of hospitals, in any particular market we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages. For example, acute care hospitals, including those owned and operated by large public companies, may choose to expand or begin offering post-acute rehabilitation services. Given that approximately 92% of our hospitals\u2019 referrals come from acute care hospitals, that increase in competition might materially and adversely affect our admission referrals in the related markets. There are also large acute care systems that may have more resources available to compete than we have.\nIn the home health and hospice services industry, our primary competition comes from locally owned private home health companies or acute-care hospitals with adjunct home health services and typically varies from market to market. We compete with a variety of other companies in providing home health and hospice services, some of which, including several large public companies, may have greater financial and other resources and may be more established in their respective communities. Competing companies may offer newer or different services from those we offer or have better relationships with referring physicians and may thereby attract patients who are presently, or would be candidates for, receiving Encompass home health or hospice services. The other public companies have or may obtain significantly greater marketing and financial resources than we have or may obtain. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in most of our local markets. Accordingly, other companies, including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing competing services, may expand their services to include home health services, hospice care, community care services, or similar services.\nThere can be no assurance this competition, or other competition which we may encounter in the future, will not adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, from time to time, there are efforts in states with certificate of need (\u201cCON\u201d) laws to weaken those laws, which could potentially increase competition in those states. Conversely, competition and statutory procedural requirements in some CON states may inhibit our ability to expand our operations. For a breakdown of the CON status of the states and territories in which we have operations, see Item 2, Properties.\nIf we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with patient referral sources, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on referrals from physicians, hospitals, case managers and other patient referral sources in the communities served. Referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers. Our growth and profitability depend on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of inpatient rehabilition, home health, and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and operate profitably.\nWe may have difficulty completing investments and transactions that increase our capacity consistent with our growth strategy.\nWe are selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions of, and in some instances joint ventures with, other healthcare providers. We may face limitations on our ability to identify sufficient acquisition or other development targets and to complete those transactions to meet goals. In the home health industry, there is significant competition among acquirors attempting to secure the acquisition of companies that have a large number of locations. In many states, the need to obtain governmental approvals, such as a CON or an approval of a change in ownership, may represent a significant obstacle to completing transactions. Additionally, in states with CON laws, it is not unusual for third-party providers to challenge initial awards of CONs, the increase in the number of approved beds in an existing CON, or expand or change the area served, and the adjudication of those challenges and related appeals may take multiple years. These factors may increase the cost to us associated with any acquisition or prevent us from completing one or more acquisitions.\nWe may make investments or complete transactions that could expose us to unforeseen risks and liabilities.\nInvestments, acquisitions, joint ventures or other development opportunities identified and completed may involve material cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses, amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies, issuances of equity securities, and expenses, some of which are unforeseen, that could affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations, including state CONs as well as CMS and other regulatory approval requirements, on our ability to complete such acquisitions, particularly those involving not-for-profit providers, on terms, timetables, and valuations reasonable to us;\n\u2022\nlimitations in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a cost reasonable to us;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, and information systems, and in realizing projected revenues, efficiencies and cost savings, or returns on invested capital;\n\u2022\nentry into markets, businesses or services in which we may have little or no experience;\n\u2022\ndiversion of business resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations; and\n\u2022\nexposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired operations, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and anti-trust considerations in specific markets.\nIn addition to those development activities, we intend to build new, or de novo, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. The construction of new hospitals involves numerous risks, including the receipt of all zoning and other regulatory approvals, such as a CON where necessary, construction delays and cost over-runs and unforeseen environmental liability exposure. Once built, new hospitals must undergo the state and Medicare certification process, the duration of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to operate newly constructed hospitals as profitably as expected, and those hospitals may involve significant additional cash expenditures and operating expenses that could, in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions or realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions.\nWe may undertake strategic acquisitions from time to time. For example, we have recently completed the acquisitions of Encompass, the operations of Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC and affiliated entities (\u201cReliant\u201d) and the home care operations of CareSouth Health System, Inc. (\u201cCareSouth\u201d), which are discussed in Item 1, Business, \u201cOverview of the Company.\u201d Prior to consummation of any acquisition, the acquired business will have operated independently of us, with its own procedures, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems. We will fold those businesses into our existing business as one combined organization, for example utilizing certain common information systems, operating procedures, administrative functions, financial and internal controls and human resources practices. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in the integration of an acquired business with our business. Additionally, an acquisition could cause disruption to our business and operations and our relationships with customers, employees and other parties. In some cases, the acquired business has itself grown through acquisitions, as was the case with Encompass, Reliant and CareSouth, and there may be legacy systems, operating policies and procedures, financial and administrative practices yet to be fully integrated. To the extent we are attempting to integrate multiple businesses at the same time, we may not be able to do so as efficiently or effectively as we would prefer. The failure to successfully integrate on a timely basis any acquired business with our existing business could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe anticipate our acquisitions, including Encompass, Reliant and CareSouth, will result in benefits including, among other things, increased revenues and an enhanced ability to provide a continuum of facility-based and home-based post-acute healthcare services. However, acquired businesses may not contribute to our revenues or earnings to the extent anticipated, and any synergies we expect may not be realized after the acquisitions have been completed. If the acquired businesses underperform and such underperformance is other than temporary, we may be required to take an impairment charge. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in the inability to meet the financial ratios and financial condition tests under our credit agreement and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCompetition for staffing, shortages of qualified personnel, union activity or other factors may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nOur operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical personnel, such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our locations. In some markets, the lack of availability of medical personnel is a significant operating issue facing all healthcare providers. A shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel or to contract for more expensive temporary personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not experience reimbursement rate or pricing increases generally to offset these additional costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited. In particular, if labor costs rise at an annual rate greater than our net annual market basket update from Medicare or we continue to experience a shift in our payor mix to lower rate payors such as Medicaid, our results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected. Conversely, decreases in reimbursement revenues, such as with sequestration, may limit our ability to increase compensation or benefits to the extent necessary to retain key employees, in turn increasing our turnover and associated costs. Union activity is another factor that may contribute to increased labor costs. We currently have a minimal number of union employees, so an increase in labor union activity could have a significant impact on our labor costs. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified medical personnel, or to control our labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are a defendant in various lawsuits, and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims, and legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits. The material lawsuits and investigations, including the subpoenas received from HHS-OIG, are discussed in Note 17, Contingencies and Other Commitments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Substantial damages, fines, or other remedies assessed against us or agreed to in settlements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the costs of defending litigation and investigations, even if frivolous or nonmeritorious, could be significant.\nHome care services, by their very nature, are provided in an environment, the patient\u2019s place of residence, that is not in the substantial control of the healthcare provider. Accordingly, home care involves an increased level of associated risk of general and professional liability. On any given day, we have thousands of nurses, therapists and other care providers driving to and from the homes of patients where they deliver care. We cannot predict the impact any claims arising out of the travel, the home visits or the care being provided, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. We also cannot predict the adequacy of any reserves for such losses or recoveries from any insurance or re-insurance policies.\nWe insure a substantial portion of our professional liability, general liability, and workers\u2019 compensation liability risks, which may not include risks related to regulatory fines and penalties, through our captive insurance subsidiary, as discussed further in Note 9, Self-Insured Risks, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Changes in the number of these liability claims and the cost to resolve them impact the reserves for these risks. A variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of the reserves for these liability risks, which could have an effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe False Claims Act allows private citizens, called \u201crelators,\u201d to institute civil proceedings alleging violations of the False Claims Act. These lawsuits, which may be initiated by \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys\u2019 fees and the award of bounties to the relators who successfully bring these suits and to the government. These qui tam cases are sealed by the court at the time of filing. Prior to the lifting of the seal by the court, the only parties typically privy to the information contained in the complaint are the relator, the federal government, and the presiding court. It is possible that qui tam lawsuits have been filed against us and that those suits remain under seal or that we are unaware of such filings or prevented by existing law or court order from discussing or disclosing the filing of such suits. We may be subject to liability under one or more undisclosed qui tam cases brought pursuant to the False Claims Act.\nThe proper function, availability, and security of our information systems are critical to our business.\nWe are and will remain dependent on the proper function, availability and security of our and third-party information systems, including our electronic clinical information system (the \u201cCIS\u201d) which plays a substantial role in the operations of the hospitals in which it is installed and the information systems currently in use by Encompass. We undertake substantial measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems, and we periodically test the adequacy of our security and disaster recovery measures. We have implemented administrative, technical and physical controls on our systems and devices in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to that data, which includes patient information subject to the protections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and other sensitive information. For additional discussion of these laws, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulation.\u201d\nAs part of our efforts, we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches, including cyber attacks, or to alleviate problems caused by breaches, including unauthorized access to or theft of patient data and protected health information stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems. We also attempt to provide our employees training and regular reminders on important measures they can take to prevent breaches. However, given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, there can be no assurance our safety and security measures or network security or other controls will detect and prevent security or data breaches, including cyber-attacks, in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations. For example, it has been widely reported that many well-organized international interests are targeting the theft of patient information through the use of advance persistent threats. Accordingly, we may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach or unavailability of our information systems as well as any systems used in acquired operations.\nA compromise of our safety and security measures, or network security or other controls, or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to significant remedial costs as well as regulatory actions and claims from patients, financial institutions, and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant resources to repair or improve our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. In the case of a material breach or cyber-attack, the associated expenses and losses may exceed our current insurance coverage for such events. Failure to maintain proper function, security, or availability of our information systems or protect our data against unauthorized access could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur CIS is subject to a licensing, implementation, technology hosting, and support agreement with Cerner Corporation. In June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Cerner to begin a company-wide implementation of this system in 2012. As of December 31, 2015, we have installed the CIS in 83 hospitals. We expect to complete installation in our existing hospitals by the end of 2017. Similarly, Encompass has an agreement to license, host, and support its comprehensive management and clinical information system, Homecare Homebase. Our inability, or the inability of software vendors, to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems, software, and hardware could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations, including affecting patient care. In addition, costs, unexpected problems, and interruptions associated with the implementation or transition to new systems or technology or with adequate support of those systems or technology across multiple hospitals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSuccessful execution of our current business plan depends on our key personnel.\nThe success of our current business plan depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. We rely upon their ability, expertise, experience, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith. With respect to our newly acquired home health business, we rely on the experience and expertise of Encompass\u2019 management team in that industry. In order to retain this experience and expertise, we have entered into three-year employment agreements that include noncompetition and other restrictive covenants with certain key senior management personnel of Encompass. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to retain these individuals or other members of Encompass\u2019 management team. If we are unable to retain these members of Encompass\u2019 senior management, we could face increased difficulties in operating Encompass and in expanding our presence in home health and hospice.\nThere can be no assurance that we will retain our key executives and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. If we lose key personnel, we may be unable to replace them with personnel of comparable experience in, or knowledge of, the healthcare provider industry or our specific post-acute segments. The loss of\nthe services of any of these individuals could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur leverage or level of indebtedness may have negative consequences for our business, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have approximately $2.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding (including that portion of long-term debt classified as current and excluding $288.2 million in capital leases). See Note 8, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Subject to specified limitations, our credit agreement and the indentures governing our debt securities permit us and our subsidiaries to incur material additional debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described here could intensify.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competing providers that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations for outstanding amounts under our credit facility, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates, as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are subject to contingent liabilities, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. Although we expect to make scheduled interest payments and principal reductions, we cannot provide assurance that changes in our business or other factors will not occur that may have the effect of preventing us from satisfying obligations under our debt instruments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other needs or have an unanticipated cash payment obligation, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing or reduce expenditures or sell assets we deem necessary to our business. We cannot provide assurance these measures would be possible or any additional financing could be obtained.\nThe restrictive covenants in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes could affect our ability to execute aspects of our business plan successfully.\nThe terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes do, and our future debt instruments may, contain various provisions that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock; or repay, redeem or repurchase our subordinated obligations;\n\u2022\nissue or sell certain types of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur obligations that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. For additional discussion of our material debt covenants, see the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. See the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Although we remained in compliance with the financial ratios and financial condition tests as of December 31, 2015, we cannot provide assurance we will continue to do so. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests. A severe downturn in earnings, failure to realize anticipated earnings from acquisitions, or, if we have outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the time, a rapid increase in interest rates could impair our ability to comply with those financial ratios and financial condition tests and we may need to obtain waivers from the required proportion of the lenders to avoid being in default. If we try to obtain a waiver or other relief from the required lenders, we may not be able to obtain it or such relief might have a material cost to us or be on terms less favorable than those in our existing debt. If a default occurs, the lenders could exercise their rights, including declaring all the funds borrowed (together with accrued and unpaid interest) to be immediately due and payable, terminating their commitments or instituting foreclosure proceedings against our assets, which, in turn, could cause the default and acceleration of the maturity of our other indebtedness. A breach of any other restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement or the indentures governing our senior notes would also (after giving effect to applicable grace periods, if any) result in an event of default with the same outcome.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 75% of our consolidated Property and equipment, net was held by HealthSouth Corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries under our credit agreement. See Note 8, Long-term Debt, and Note 20, Condensed Consolidating Financial Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and Item 2, Properties.\nUncertainty in the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our development objectives.\nIn recent years, the global and sovereign credit markets have experienced significant disruptions, and the debt ceiling and federal budget disputes in the United States affected capital markets. Future market shocks could negatively affect the availability or terms of certain types of debt and equity financing, including access to revolving lines of credit. Future business needs combined with market conditions at the time may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. For example, tight credit markets, such as might result from further turmoil in the sovereign debt markets, would likely make additional financing more expensive and difficult to obtain. The inability to obtain additional financing at attractive rates or prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance or our growth opportunities.\nAs a result of credit market uncertainty, we also face potential exposure to counterparties who may be unable to adequately service our needs, including the ability of the lenders under our credit agreement to provide liquidity when needed. We monitor the financial strength of our depositories, creditors, and insurance carriers using publicly available information, as well as qualitative inputs.\nIf any of our hospitals or home health or hospice agencies fail to comply with the Medicare conditions of participation, that hospital or agency could be terminated from the Medicare program.\nEach of our hospitals and home health and hospice agencies must comply with extensive conditions of participation for certification in the Medicare program. If any fail to meet any of the Medicare conditions of participation, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state survey agency. If that hospital or agency then fails to institute an acceptable plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the applicable correction period, it could lose the ability to bill Medicare. For example, the conditions require that hospice agencies have a certain number of volunteers. A hospital or agency could be terminated from the Medicare benefit if it fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period. If CMS terminates one hospital or agency, it may increase its scrutiny of others under common control. Additionally, in October 2014, CMS proposed revisions to the Medicare conditions of participation applicable to home health agencies and intended to provide home health agencies with enhanced flexibility while focusing provider efforts on patient services, quality of care, and quality assessment and performance improvement efforts. Any termination of one or more of our hospitals or agencies from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the conditions of participation could adversely affect its patient service revenue and profitability and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 10693, "SIC": 8060, "TIC": "EHC"}
