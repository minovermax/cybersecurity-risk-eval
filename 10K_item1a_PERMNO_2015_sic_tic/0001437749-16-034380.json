{"cik": "1084332", "company": "SALON MEDIA GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nSalon\u2019s business faces significant risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks Salon faces. Additional risks that are not yet known or that are currently immaterial may also impair its business operations or have a negative impact on its stock price. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, its business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of its Common Stock could decline. The Risk Factors set forth below have not materially changed from those included in our Fiscal 2015 Annual Report.\nSalon has historically lacked significant revenues and has a history of losses\nWe have a history of significant losses and expect to incur a loss from operations, based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and to be determined in future years. Even if we attain profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or operating expenses exceed expectations, financial results will most likely be severely harmed and our ability to continue operations will be seriously jeopardized.\nBurr Pilger Mayer, Inc., Salon\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 through 2016 included a \u201cgoing-concern\u201d audit opinion on the financial statements for each of those years. The audit opinions report substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, citing issues such as the history of losses and absence of current profitability. As a result of the \u201cgoing-concern\u201d opinions, our stock price and investment prospects have been and will continue to be adversely affected, thus limiting financing choices and raising concerns about the realization of value on assets and operations.\nThe Company has operated principally with the assistance of interest free advances from related parties. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nSalon\u2019s projected cash flows may not meet expectations\nWe rely on cash projections to run our business and change such projections as new information is made available or events occur. The most significant component of our cash projections is cash to be generated from advertising sales. Forecasting advertising revenues and resulting cash receipts for an extended period of time is problematic due to the short duration of most advertising sales contracts. If projected cash inflows and outflows do not meet expectations, our ability to continue as a going concern may be adversely affected.\nIf we forecast or experience periods of limited, or diminishing cash resources, we may need to sell additional securities or borrow additional funds. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue additional securities in future periods or borrow additional funds on commercially reasonable terms to meet our cash needs. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be adversely affected if we are unable to raise additional cash from sources we have relied upon in the past or new sources.\nWe have relied on related parties for significant investment capital\nWe have relied on cash infusions from related parties to fund operations for many years. The related parties are primarily John Warnock, Chairman of the Board of Salon, and William Hambrecht. William Hambrecht is a Director and the father of our former CEO and current Chief Financial Officer, Elizabeth Hambrecht. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, Mr. Warnock made approximately $2.2 million in cash advances to fund our operations. Subsequent to March 31, 2016, Mr. Warnock provided an additional $350,000 to meet our working capital requirements.\nCurtailment of cash investments and borrowing guarantees by related parties would detrimentally impact our cash availability and our ability to fund our operations.\nWe started collective bargaining with our non-supervisory editorial employees, and the results of this process are uncertain\nOn August 3, 2015, the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. (\u201cWGAE\u201d) became the collective bargaining representative of Salon\u2019s non-supervisory editorial employees. We commenced collective bargaining with the WGAE in November 2015. Should this collective bargaining process result in an agreement that would not permit us to obtain additional funding, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our current business.\nOur principal stockholders exercise a controlling influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which non-principal stockholders disagree, which may affect the value of non-principal stockholders\u2019 investments\nApproximately 45% of our voting securities are controlled, directly or indirectly by our Chairman, John Warnock, and approximately 36% is controlled directly or indirectly by William Hambrecht, a Director and the father of our Chief Financial Officer. We remain dependent upon Mr. Warnock and Mr. Hambrecht for continued financial support while we seek external financing from potential investors in the form of additional indebtedness or through the sale of equity securities in a private placement. While all outstanding, unsecured, interest-free cash advances from Mr. Warnock and Mr. Hambrecht at February 28, 2013 were exchanged for Common Stock in the Company\u2019s Recapitalization, details of which were described in Note 4 to the financial statements included in the 2015 Annual Report, Mr. Warnock has continued to make unsecured, interest-free, cash advances to cover our operating expenses. These advances are payable on demand, and are exchangeable into securities on the same terms as those to be issued in our next financing from non-related parties. We were advised by Mr. Warnock and Mr. Hambrecht that they executed a stock transaction that has the effect of equalizing their stock ownership. The corresponding Forms 4 and Form 8-K were filed with the SEC on November 24 and November 25, 2015, respectively.\nFuture sales of significant number of shares of our Common Stock by principal stockholders could cause our stock price to decline\nOur directors and officers own approximately 65 million shares, or 83% in the aggregate, of our Common Stock. As our Common Stock is normally thinly traded, if our principal stockholders were to sell their shares of Common Stock, the per share price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nOur stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond our control and which may prevent our stockholders from reselling Common Stock at a profit\nThe securities markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, has reduced and may continue to reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, our stock is thinly traded. Even a few transactions, whether in response to disappointment in our expected operating results or any other reason, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decrease significantly.\nHolders of our Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to potentially significant liquidation preferences of Salon\u2019s assets over holders of our Common Stock in the event of a liquidation event\nHolders of our Series C Preferred Stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) have liquidation preferences over holders of Common Stock of the first approximately $2.6 million in potential sales proceeds as of March 31, 2016, which includes the effect of undeclared dividends, if granted, of about $0.8 million. If a liquidation event were to occur, and Preferred Stock dividends were declared, the holders of Preferred Stock would be entitled to the first $2.6 million of cash distributions. If a liquidation event were to occur in excess of $2.6 million and if Preferred Stock dividends were to be declared, the holders of Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive a relatively larger distribution than the holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive.\nWe depend on advertising sales for substantially all of our revenues, and our inability to maintain or increase advertising revenues would harm our business\nOur ability to maintain or increase our advertising revenues depends upon many factors, including whether we will be able to:\n\u25cf\nattract and maintain additional visitors to our Website and increase brand awareness;\n\u25cf\nsell and market our Website or other rich media advertisements;\n\u25cf\nmaintain a significant number of sellable impressions generated from Website visitors available to advertisers;\n\u25cf\nincrease the dollar amount of our advertising orders;\n\u25cf\nimprove our Website\u2019s technology for serving advertising;\n\u25cf\nhandle temporary high volume traffic spikes to our Website;\n\u25cf\nmeasure accurately the number and demographic characteristics of our users; and\n\u25cf\nattract and retain key sales personnel.\nAs more of our users access our Website using mobile devices rather than PCs, if we do not continue to grow our mobile users and revenue, our business will be adversely impacted.\nInternet users increasingly use mobile devices rather than PCs to access the Internet. Over 50% of our monthly users are now visiting our Website on mobile devices. As mobile platforms encompass a larger share of our readers, our ability to grow advertising revenue is increasingly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices. While we plan to continue to devote technology resources to support our mobile browser product, apps and advertising products, if our mobile browser product, apps, and advertising products for mobile devices do not attract and retain users and advertisers to generate mobile revenue, our operating and financial results will be adversely impacted. We are dependent upon our products operating on mobile operating systems we do not control. The mobile phone manufacturer and its operating systems might block access to our Website or make it hard for users to find our Website through their devices, or block certain ads or charge us for delivery of ads, all of which would harm our operations and suppress revenue potential.\nTechnologies and software applications could block our advertisements, which could harm our operating results.\nTechnologies and software applications have been developed for PC and mobile devices that can block or allow users to opt out of display advertising, delete or block cookies used to deliver advertising, or move advertising to less optimal placements to suppress view-ability. Most of our advertising revenue is derived from display or video advertisements on our Website. As a result, ad-blocking technologies or software could reduce the number of display or video advertisements\nIf we cannot increase referrals from social media platforms, our ability to attract new unique visitors and maintain the engagement of existing unique visitors could be adversely affected.\nAs the behavior of internet consumers continues to change, distribution of our content, products and services via traditional methods may become less effective, and new distribution strategies may need to be developed. Consumers are increasingly using social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to communicate and to acquire and disseminate information. As consumers migrate towards social networks, we continue to build social elements into our content, products and services in order to make them available on social networks and to attract and engage consumers on our Website and mobile platforms. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate our content with such social networking or other new consumer trends. Even if we are able to distribute our content, products and services effectively through social networking or other new or developing distribution channels, this does not assure that we will be able to attract new unique visitors.\nHackers may attempt to penetrate our security system and online security breaches could harm our business\nConsumer and supplier confidence in our Website depends on maintaining strong security features. Experienced programmers or \u201chackers\u201d have penetrated sectors of our systems, and we expect that these attempts will continue to occur from time to time. To our knowledge, there has been no outward harm to us or our users as a result of hacking attempts. Furthermore, Salon has engaged the services of a third-party web application security-testing company, which conducts regular comprehensive searches for any vulnerabilities that may exist, allowing us to address and fix any issues before they can be exploited. This minimizes the risk of damage; however, because a hacker who is able to penetrate network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our products and services, we may have to expend significant capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate problems caused by hackers. Additionally, we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security. Such security breaches could materially affect our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to risk of loss or litigation. In addition, the transmission of computer viruses resulting from hackers or otherwise could expose us to significant liability. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with whom we have relationships.\nWe must promote the Salon brand to attract and retain users, advertisers and strategic partners\nThe success of the Salon brand depends largely on our ability to provide high quality content and services. If Internet users do not perceive our existing content and services to be of high quality, or if we introduce new content and services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably perceived by users, we may not be successful in promoting and maintaining the Salon brand. Any change in the focus of our operations creates a risk of diluting our brand, confusing consumers and decreasing the value of our user base to advertisers. If we are unable to maintain or grow the Salon brand, our business would be severely harmed.\nWe must hire, integrate and/or retain qualified personnel to support our business plans\nOur success significantly depends on key personnel. In addition, because our users must perceive the content of our Website as having been created by credible and notable sources, our success also depends on the name recognition and reputation of our editorial staff. Due to our history of losses, we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. We may be unable to retain our current key employees or attract, integrate or retain other qualified employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel, our business would be harmed.\nOur success depends on our key personnel, including our executive officers, and the loss of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, could disrupt our business\nOur success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key sales, marketing and operations personnel. While we have employment agreements with some key management, these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time. We may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify, hire and integrate new personnel. We do not have key person insurance policies in place for these employees.\nWe may expend significant resources to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend claims of infringement by third parties, and if we are not successful we may lose rights to use significant material or be required to pay significant fees\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent on our proprietary content. We rely exclusively on copyright law to protect our content. While we actively take steps to protect our proprietary rights, these steps may not be adequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our content, which could severely harm our business. We also license content from various freelance providers and other third-party content providers. While we attempt to ensure that such content may be freely licensed to us, other parties may assert claims of infringement against us relating to such content.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop, market and deliver new services. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or rights granted pursuant to any licenses may not be valid and enforceable.\nIn April 1999, we acquired the Internet address www.salon.com. Because www.salon.com is the address of the main home page to our Website and incorporates Salon\u2019s name, it is a vital part of our intellectual property assets. We do not have a registered trademark on the address, and therefore it may be difficult for us to prevent a third party from infringing on our intellectual property rights to the address. If we fail to adequately protect our rights to the Website address, or if a third party infringes our rights to the address, or otherwise dilutes the value of www.salon.com, our business could be harmed.\nOur technology development efforts may not be successful in improving the functionality of our network, which could result in reduced traffic on our Website or reduced advertising revenues\nWe are constantly upgrading our technology to manage our Website. We create new products that we expect to launch on an ongoing basis. If these systems do not work as intended, or if we are unable to continue to develop these systems to keep up with the rapid evolution of technology for content delivery, our Website may not operate properly, which could harm our business. Additionally, software product design, development and enhancement involve creativity, expense and the use of new development tools and learning processes. Delays in software development processes are common, as are project failures, and either factor could harm our business. Moreover, complex software products such as our online publishing platform frequently contain undetected errors or shortcomings, and may fail to perform or scale as expected. Although we have tested and will continue to test our systems, errors or deficiencies may be found in these systems that could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies necessary to deliver content, advertising and services to our users, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or acceptance of these formats and technologies could adversely affect our business\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies that we use to deliver content, advertising, and services to our users. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license their technologies or intellectual property to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Providers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business models in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of their technologies. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of the technologies to deliver our content, advertising, and services. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of those technologies, and any change in licensing terms, costs, availability, or user acceptance of these technologies could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be held liable for content or third party links on our Website or content distributed to third parties\nAs a publisher and distributor of content over the Internet, including links to third-party websites that may be accessible through our Website, or content that includes links or references to a third-party\u2019s website, we face potential liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature, content or ownership of the material that is published on or distributed from our Website. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services, websites and print publications in the past. Other claims may be based on errors or false or misleading information provided on linked websites, including information deemed to constitute professional advice such as legal, medical, financial or investment advice. Other claims may be based on links to sexually explicit websites. Although we carry general liability and media insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liabilities imposed. Any liability that is not covered by our insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could severely harm our financial condition and business. Implementing measures to reduce our exposure to these forms of liability may require us to spend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our service to users.\nOur systems may fail due to natural disasters, telecommunications failures and other events, any of which would limit user traffic\nOur Website \u201csalon.com\u201d, and content management system run on cloud computing hosted by Amazon Web Services, which are in a facility in Herndon, Virginia. Any disruption of Amazon\u2019s cloud computing platform could result in a service outage. Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, supplier failure to meet commitments, and similar events could damage these systems and cause interruptions in our services. Computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive problems could cause users to stop visiting our Website and could cause advertisers to terminate any agreements with us. In addition, we could lose advertising revenues during these interruptions and user satisfaction could be negatively impacted if the service is slow or unavailable. If any of these circumstances occurred, our business could be harmed. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to any failures of or interruptions in our systems. We do not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan.\nOur Website must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information. It is possible that we will experience systems failures in the future and that such failures could harm our business. In addition, our users depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other website operators for access to our Website. Many of these providers and operators have experienced significant outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems. Any of these system failures could harm our business.\nPrivacy concerns could impair our business\nWe have a policy against using personally identifiable information obtained from users of our Website and services without the user\u2019s permission. In the past, the Federal Trade Commission has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy. If we use personal information without permission or in violation of our policy, we may face potential liability for invasion of privacy for compiling and providing information to our corporate customers and electronic commerce merchants. In addition, legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify Internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user. Other countries and political entities, such as the European Union, have adopted such legislation or regulatory requirements. The United States may adopt similar legislation or regulatory requirements in the future. If consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nDue to the volatility of the price of our Common Stock, we may be the target of securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend\nThe price of our Common Stock has experienced volatility in the past, and may continue to do so in the future. In the past, following volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities, securities holders have instituted class action litigation against such company. Many companies have been subjected to this type of litigation. If the market value of our Common Stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the merits or outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted, causing our business, financial condition and operating results to suffer. To date, we have not been subject to such litigation.\nOur quarterly operating results are volatile and may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock\nOur future revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, and any of which could severely harm our business. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nOur ability to attract and retain advertisers;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to attract and retain a large number of users;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to increase referrals from our social media presence;\n\u25cf\nThe introduction of new websites, services or products by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to maximize our mobile presence;\n\u25cf\nThe timing and uncertainty of our advertising sales cycles;\n\u25cf\nThe mix of advertisements sold by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nEconomic and business cycles;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to attract, integrate and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nTechnical difficulties or system downtime affecting the Internet generally or the operation of our Website; and\n\u25cf\nThe amount and timing of operating costs.\nDue to the factors noted above and the other risks discussed in this section and throughout this Annual Report, one should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that some future periods\u2019 results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this occurs, the price of our Common Stock may decline.\nProvisions in Delaware law and our charter, stock option agreements and offer letters to executive officers may prevent or delay a change of control\nWe are subject to the Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger or sale of more than 10% of its assets with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s assets unless:\n\u25cf\nthe board of directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s assets;\n\u25cf\nafter the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s assets, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, excluding shares owned by directors, officers and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u25cf\non or after such date, the merger or sale is approved by the board of directors and the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the stockholder.\nA Delaware corporation may opt out of the Delaware anti-takeover laws if its certificate of incorporation or bylaws so provide. We have not opted out of the provisions of the anti-takeover laws. As such, these laws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeovers or changes of control of Salon and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a provision relating to special meetings of our shareholders that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption) or by the holders of not less than 10% of all of the shares entitled to cast votes at the meeting. This provision may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.\nIn addition, employment agreements with certain executive officers provide for the payment of severance and acceleration of the vesting of options and restricted stock in the event of termination of the executive officer following a change of control of Salon. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts.", "PERMNO": 86995, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SLNM"}
