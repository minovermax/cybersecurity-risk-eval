{"cik": "1279363", "company": "WELLCARE HEALTH PLANS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. As such, you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to estimate and manage medical benefits expense effectively, our profitability likely will be reduced or we could become unprofitable.\nOur profitability depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to estimate and effectively manage our costs related to the provision of health care services. Relatively small changes in the ratio of our expenses related to health care services to the premiums we receive (the \u201cmedical benefits ratio\u201d or \u201cMBR\u201d) can create significant changes in our financial results. Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable, and estimating medical benefits expense is a continuous process, which depends on the information available to us and our ability to utilize such information. Factors that may cause medical benefits expense to exceed our estimates include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe addition of new members, whether by acquisition, new enrollment, program startup or expansion (including geographic expansion), whose risk profiles are uncertain or unknown and for whom initiatives to manage their care take longer than expected;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of health care services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals, whether as a result of the introduction of new products or technologies, inflation or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe performance of our pharmaceutical benefit manager in managing our pharmaceutical costs;\n\u2022\nhigher-than-expected utilization of health care services;\n\u2022\ncontractual provisions related to continuity of care for new members;\n\u2022\nperiodic renegotiation of hospital, physician and/or other provider contracts;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of catastrophes, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, terrorism or bio-terrorism;\n\u2022\nchanges in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them;\n\u2022\nchallenges in implementing medical expense cost control initiatives, especially during the first year of a new Medicaid program;\n\u2022\nnew mandated benefits, increased mandated provider reimbursement rates or other changes in health care laws, regulations, public policy and/or practices;\n\u2022\nemerging changes in the economy; and\n\u2022\nchanges in members' behavior and health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices (including those driven by the implementation of ICD-10, effective October 1, 2015) and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control.\nThe factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimates of costs, including medical benefits expense, inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us, or the state or federal client, such as when we commence operations in a new state or region or commence participation in a new program. In many cases, the degree of our ability to accurately estimate medical benefits expense may not be known until we have sufficient experience and more complete information. For example, levels of plan utilization and members\u2019 use of medical services, provider claims submissions, our payment processes and other factors can result in identifiable patterns emerging only following the passage of a significant period of time after the occurrence of the underlying causes of deviations from our assumptions. If our medical benefits expense increases and we are unable to manage these medical costs effectively in the future, our profits would likely be reduced or we may not remain profitable, which would also affect our liquidity, cash flows and our ability to comply with statutory requirements.\nMost of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries, depending on the type of member in our plans. These payments, from the states, are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract period, which is generally one to three years, to provide or arrange for the provision of health care services as established by the states and the federal government. The payments are generally set based on an estimation of the medical costs using actuarially sound methods based on historical\ndata, factors and assumptions. When we commence operations in a new state or region or commence participation in a new program, the factors and assumptions used to develop premiums and premium rates are subject to greater variability as there is limited experience or information available to us and the state. Actual experience could differ from the assumptions used in the premium-setting process, which could result in premiums being insufficient to cover our medical benefits expense.\nFor example, in 2014 and 2015, several new, extremely high cost drugs were approved by the Federal Drug Administration. In our Florida MMA program, our claims experience ran significantly higher in the first months of implementation than we had originally estimated. Because the Florida MMA program requires its participating plans to utilize the state's drug formulary, it is more difficult for us to manage the pharmaceutical costs. In addition, we experienced unfavorable development of prior year reserve amounts in three of the four quarters in 2013, and in the first and second quarters of 2014, particularly in our Medicaid and Medicare Health Plans segments. Our medical benefits expense may exceed our estimates or our regulators\u2019 actuarial pricing assumptions and we may be unable to adjust the premiums we receive under our current contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAssumptions and estimates are utilized in establishing premium deficiency reserves. If our assumptions are inaccurate, our reserves may be inadequate to pay medical costs, we may be required to increase our premium deficiency reserve and there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur MA and PDP plans, as well as certain of our Medicaid plans, are subject to a minimum Medical Loss Ratio (\u201cMLR\u201d), which requires health plans to spend not less than a certain percentage of premiums on medical benefits. If a minimum MLR is not met, then we could be required to refund a portion of our premiums back to the state or CMS, as applicable.\nIn addition, there are sometimes wide variations in the established rates per member in both our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business. For instance, the rates we receive for a Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) member are generally significantly higher than for a non-SSI member who is otherwise similarly situated. As the composition of our membership base changes as the result of programmatic, competitive, regulatory, benefit design, economic or other changes; there is a corresponding change to our premium revenue, costs and margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSome provider contracts are directly tied to state Medicaid or Medicare fee schedules, which the state or CMS, respectively, may increase without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us. We have experienced similar types of adjustments in states in which we operate. Unless such adjustments are mitigated by an increase in premiums, or if this were to occur in any more of the states in which we operate, our profitability will be negatively affected.\nAlso, in some rural areas, it is difficult to maintain a provider network sufficient to meet regulatory requirements. In situations where we have a deficiency in our provider network, regulators require us to allow members to obtain care from out-of-network providers at no additional cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage medical benefits expenses. In some states, with respect to certain services, the amount that the health plan must pay to out-of-network providers for services provided to our members is defined by law or regulation, but in certain instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms. Out-of-network providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the health plan. The uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustments of the payment could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nAlthough we maintain reinsurance to protect us against certain severe or catastrophic medical claims, we cannot assure that such reinsurance coverage currently is or will be adequate or available to us in the future or that the cost of such reinsurance will not limit our ability to obtain it.\nWe rely on a number of third parties, and failure of any one of the third parties to perform in accordance with our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have determined, based on an evaluation of factors, including cost, compliance, quality and procurement success, that it is more efficient to use third parties instead of our personnel for certain functions. As a result, we have contracted with a number of third parties to provide significant operational support including, but not limited to, pharmacy benefit management for our members as well as certain enrollment, billing, call center, benefit administration, claims processing functions, sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management. We have limited ability to control the performance of these third parties. If a third party provides services that we are required to provide under a contract with a government client, we are responsible for such performance and will be held accountable by the government client for any failure of performance by our vendors. Significant failure by a third party to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts could subject us to fines or\nother sanctions or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, upon termination of a third party contract, we may encounter difficulties in replacing the third party on favorable terms, transitioning services to another vendor, or in assuming those responsibilities ourselves, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, quality scores and results of operations. For example, we have a new pharmacy benefit manager as of January 1, 2016, which has created operational challenges during the transition and we will incur transitory costs that we would not have otherwise incurred as a result of the implementation. In addition, in November 2014, we outsourced our mail order pharmacy. Further, we rely on state-operated systems and sub-contractors to qualify and assign eligible members into our health plan. Ineffectiveness of these state operations and sub-contractors can have a material adverse effect on our enrollment.\nFailure to maintain satisfactory quality scores could negatively affect our premium rates, subject us to penalties, limit or reduce our membership, impede our ability to compete for new business in existing or new markets or result in the termination of our contracts, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, rate of growth and results of operations.\nQuality scores are used by certain agencies to establish premium rates or, in the case of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), to pay bonuses to Medicare Advantage (\u201cMA\u201d) plans that enable high scoring plans to offer enhanced health benefits which are attractive to members.\nCertain provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cACA\u201d) provide additional Medicare revenue related to the achievement of higher Star Ratings that can be used to offer more attractive benefit packages to members and/or achieve higher profit margins. In addition, plans with Star Ratings of 4.0 or higher are eligible for year-round open enrollment, whereas plans with lower Star Ratings have more restrictions on enrollment criteria and timing. As a result, plans that achieve higher Star Ratings may have a competitive advantage in the Medicare market over plans with lower Star Ratings. None of our plans achieved a 4.0 Star Rating in 2015, so we receive less quality-related additional revenue and have more restrictions on benefit design, enrollment criteria and timing than our competitors with higher Star Ratings. We may not be able to improve our Star Ratings to receive additional quality-related revenue, more flexibility in our benefit design, or to market our products more freely in the future. This could have a material adverse effect on the profitability and membership of our Medicare plans.\nPart C or Part D Medicare plans with Star Ratings of less than three stars for three consecutive years are denoted as \"low performing\" plans on the CMS website and in the CMS \"Medicare and You\" handbook. Furthermore, plans deemed low performing that participate in state Medicare-Medicaid dual-eligible demonstration programs are ineligible for passive enrollment, which is likely to result in lower market share in those programs.\nIn addition, plans with any Star Ratings below 3.0 for three consecutive years risk contract termination. Two of our MA contracts have been denoted as \"low performing\" plans by CMS: our MA contract serving Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina and our MA contract serving Louisiana. Our MA contract serving Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina is also subject to termination by CMS for the plan year 2017. Our efforts to retain the membership for these plans by consolidating these contracts into other, better-performing contracts held by us may not be successful. In addition, there is no assurance that Star Ratings of 3.0 can be attained or maintained for any of these plans, and they could, in the future, be subject to termination.\nCMS\u2019s current quality measurement methodology does not appropriately account for socio-economic determinants of health. Because we have a greater percentage of lower-income members than average, we may be unable to achieve a 4.0 Star Rating for some or all of our plans without a legislative or regulatory adjustment to the quality measurement methodology. Though various regulatory and legislative solutions have been proposed, we continue to work with our legislative and regulatory partners to ensure this issue is adequately addressed. However, our efforts may not be successful, and we could continue to have plans with Star Ratings lower than our competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our membership and profitability of our MA and PDP lines of business.\nIn certain state Medicaid programs, plans that do not meet applicable quality measures can be required to refund premiums previously received, may not be able to earn quality bonuses, may be required to pay penalties, or may be subject to enrollment limitations, including suspension of auto assignment of members, or termination of the contract. In addition, if the state determines that a health plan has failed to meet the contractual requirements for quality measures, these contracts may be subject to termination, or other remedies, such as liquidated damages, at the discretion of the state. We are unable to predict what actions a state may take, if any, when assessing our contractual performance.\nIn addition, lower quality scores compared to our competitors may adversely affect our ability to attract members and obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions or expansions or succeed in competitive bidding situations. As a result, lower quality\nscores compared to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, rate of growth, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAny failure by us to manage acquisitions, expansions, divestitures or other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our quality scores, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur membership has grown substantially in the last three years due to acquisitions, geographic expansions and organic growth. We may not be successful in enhancing our infrastructure to support this continued growth, and delays in infrastructure improvements may have a material adverse effect on our quality scores, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, due to the substantial initial costs related to acquisitions and expansions, such growth could adversely affect our short-term profitability and liquidity.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we identify potential acquisition targets, bid and negotiate acquisition terms, work with regulators to receive regulatory approval for the acquisition and once the transaction is closed, we must integrate the acquisition into our operations. In 2013, we completed our acquisition of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s South Carolina Medicaid plan and Aetna, Inc.\u2019s Missouri Medicaid plan. In 2014, we completed our acquisition of certain Medicaid-related assets of Healthfirst Health Plan of New Jersey, Inc. and Windsor from Munich Health North America, Inc., a part of Munich Re. Through its subsidiaries, at the time of acquisition, Windsor served Medicare beneficiaries with Medicare Advantage, Prescription Drug Plan and Medicare Supplement products.\nOnce an attractive acquisition target is identified, we may not be successful in bidding against competitors. Even if we are successful in bidding against competitors, we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approval from federal and state agencies required to complete the acquisition. Depending on the transaction size, we may not be able to obtain appropriate financing, especially in light of the volatility in the capital markets over the past several years. We may not be able to comply with the regulatory requirements necessary for approval of the acquisition or state regulators may give preference to competing offers made by locally-owned entities, competitors with higher quality scores or not-for-profit entities.\nOnce acquired, we may have difficulties integrating the businesses within our existing operations, due to factors such as:\n\u2022\nnew associates who must become familiar with our operations and company culture;\n\u2022\nacquired provider networks that operate on different terms than our existing networks and whose contracts may need to be renegotiated;\n\u2022\nexisting members who decide to switch to another health care plan;\n\u2022\ndisparate administrative and information technology systems; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties implementing our operations strategy to operate the acquired businesses profitably.\nAs a result, our acquired businesses may not perform as we anticipated, or in line with our existing businesses. In addition, if the expected future profitability of the acquired business declines, we may need to write down or incur impairment charges of the acquired assets. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a charge of $18.0 million to reflect the impairment of certain intangible assets associated with our 2012 acquisitions. In the future, we may incur additional material expenses in connection with the integration and execution of acquisitions, expansions, and other significant transactions.\nFurthermore, we may incur significant transaction expenses in connection with a potential acquisition or expansion opportunity that is not successful. For example, in October 2015, we signed a contract with the Iowa Department of Human Services to serve Iowa's Medicaid Managed Care program, effective January 1, 2016. In December 2015, CMS delayed the implementation of Iowa's Medicaid Managed Care program until March 1, 2016. Additionally, in December 2015, Iowa's Department of Administrative Services ruled to exclude the Company from participating in Iowa's Medicaid Managed care program, which the Company disputes and is currently appealing. Accordingly, in 2015, the Company's selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses include non-recurring expenses of $11.9 million related to the readiness costs, certain wind-down costs of WellCare's Iowa operations and certain legal costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company expects to continue incurring certain of these expenses in 2016, which will adversely affect our selling, general and administrative expense ratio. If we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired businesses, our future growth may suffer and our profitability may decrease.\nOur rate of expansion into other geographic areas may also be inhibited by factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals to operate;\n\u2022\nlower quality scores compared to our competitors;\n\u2022\nparticipation in fewer lines of business compared to our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to develop a network of physicians, hospitals and other health care providers that meets our requirements and those of government regulators;\n\u2022\nCMS or state contract provisions regarding quality measures, such as CMS Star Ratings;\n\u2022\ncompetition, which increases the cost of recruiting members;\n\u2022\nthe cost of providing health care services in those areas;\n\u2022\ndemographics and population density; and\n\u2022\napplicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus.\nIn any program start-up, acquisition, expansion, or re-bid, the implementation of the contract as designed may be affected by factors beyond our control. These include political considerations, network development, contract appeals, incumbency, participation in other lines of business, membership assignment (allocation of members who do not self-select), errors in the bidding process, changes to the program design or implementation timing, difficulties experienced by other private vendors involved in the implementation, such as enrollment brokers, and noncompliance with contractual requirements with which we do not yet have experience and similar risks. As a result, our business, particularly plans for expansion or increased membership levels, could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, when making award determinations and evaluating proposed acquisitions and expansions, regulators frequently consider the plan\u2019s historical regulatory compliance, litigation and reputation and we are required to disclose material investigations and litigation, including in some cases investigations and litigation that occurred in the past. As a result of the previous federal and state investigations, stockholder and derivative litigation, the restatement during 2009 of our previously issued financial statements and related matters, and the criminal trial of certain of our former executives and employees that concluded in the second quarter of 2013, we have been, and may continue to be, the subject of negative publicity. In addition, the Iowa Medicaid bid protest, and the subsequent ruling to exclude the Company from the program has resulted in negative publicity. Continuing negative publicity and other negative perceptions regarding these matters may adversely affect our ability to grow.\nOur Medicaid operations are concentrated in a limited number of states. Loss of a material contract, reduced premium rates, or delayed payment of earned premiums may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur concentration of Medicaid operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue, profitability or cash flow to change suddenly and unexpectedly as a result of significant premium rate reductions, payment delays, loss of a material contract, legislative actions, changes in Medicaid eligibility methodologies, catastrophic claims, epidemics, pandemics, unexpected increases in utilization, advances in medical technology and pharmaceutical therapies, difficulties in managing provider costs, general economic conditions and similar factors in those states. Our inability to continue to operate in any of these states, or a significant change in the nature of our existing operations, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Unfavorable changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates or increased competition in these states could therefore have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs, including Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cCHIP\u201d). We provide those health care services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our Medicaid operations in Florida, Georgia and Kentucky each accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated premium revenue, net of premium taxes. These customers accounted for contracts that have terms of between one and three years with varying expiration dates.\nOur Medicaid contracts are generally intended to run for one to three years and in some cases may be extended for additional years if the state or other sponsoring agency elects to do so. When our state contracts expire, they may be opened for bidding by competing health care plans. There is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended or, if renewed or extended, on what terms. Further, our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds. Our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies. If any of our contracts are terminated, not renewed or extended, renewed or extended on less favorable terms, or not renewed or extended on a timely basis, or if an increased number of competitors were awarded contracts in these states, our business will suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially affected.\nState governments generally are experiencing tight budgetary conditions within their Medicaid programs. As a result, government agencies with which we contract may seek funding alternatives, which may result in reductions in funding for their Medicaid programs. If any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us for these reasons or any other reason, or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. We have experienced such rate decreases in the past and may do so in the future. Economic conditions affecting state governments and agencies could also result in delays in receiving premium payments. If there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to pay health benefit costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nA significant percentage of our Medicaid plan enrollment results from mandatory enrollment in Medicaid managed care plans. States may mandate that certain types of Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in Medicaid managed care through CMS-approved state plan amendments or, for certain groups, through federal waivers or demonstrations. Waivers and programs under demonstrations are generally approved for two- to five-year periods, and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by CMS. We have no control over this renewal process. If a state in which we operate does not mandate managed care enrollment in its state plan or does not renew an existing managed care waiver, our membership would likely decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our cash flow and gross margin from our PDP operations, for which we submit annual bids for participation. The results of our bids could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nA significant portion of our PDP membership is obtained from the auto-assignment of beneficiaries in CMS-designated regions where our PDP premium bids are below benchmarks of other plans\u2019 bids. In general, our premium bids are based on assumptions regarding PDP membership, utilization, drug costs, drug rebates and other factors for each region. Our 2014 Medicare PDP bids were below the benchmarks in 30 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids. However, our 2015 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 13 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids and within the de minimis range in nine other regions. This resulted from the realignment of our benefit designs and cost structure. We may not be able to submit bids which are below benchmarks of other plans\u2019 bids in future years. Our 2016 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 17 of the 34 CMS regions and within the de minimis range in nine other regions. Our membership decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 as those PDP members who were auto assigned to us in regions where our 2015 bids were not below or within the de minimis range were assigned to other plans. For those regions in which we are within the de minimis range, we will not be eligible to have new members auto-assigned to us, but we will not lose our existing auto-assigned membership. If our future Part D premium bids are not below the CMS benchmarks, we risk losing PDP members who were previously assigned to us and we may not have additional PDP members auto-assigned to us, which could materially reduce our revenue and profits.\nIf our actual costs of providing prescription drugs are higher than our estimated costs of providing prescription drugs when we provided our bids to CMS, our funds receivable from CMS could be higher than we anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to generate or access sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, or successfully secure alternatives to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of a $300.0 million term loan and $900.0 million senior notes due 2020 (the \"Senior Notes\"). In January 2016, we entered into a new $850.0 million revolving credit agreement that matures in January 2021 and repaid the $300.0 million term loan in full. We have drawn $200.0 million of the revolving credit facility and we retain an additional $650.0 million of borrowing ability thereunder. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities, or to access the cash flows of our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and the credit agreement. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that financing sources will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and the credit agreement, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled\ndebt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes may restrict us from adopting some or all of these alternatives. If we are unable to pay our indebtedness on time, it could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness and materially adversely affect us.\nIf we commit a material breach of our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we may be excluded from certain programs, resulting in the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses potentially having a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOn April 26, 2011, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (the \u201cCorporate Integrity Agreement\u201d) with the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cOIG-HHS\u201d). The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a term of five years and concludes the previously disclosed matters relating to us under review by OIG-HHS. The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires us to maintain various ethics and compliance programs that are designed to help ensure our ongoing compliance with federal health care program requirements. The terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement include certain organizational structure requirements, internal monitoring requirements, compliance training, screening processes for new employees, who we call associates, requirements for reporting to OIG-HHS, and the engagement of an independent review organization to review and prepare written reports regarding, among other things, our reporting practices and bid submissions to federal health care programs.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we may be required to pay certain monetary penalties. Furthermore, if we commit a material breach of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, OIG-HHS will exclude us from participating in federal health care programs. Any such exclusion would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe requirements of the ACA may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe believe the ACA will continue to bring about significant changes to the American health care system. These measures are intended to expand the number of United States residents covered by health insurance and make other coverage, delivery, and payment changes to the current health care system. The costs of implementing the ACA will be financed, in part, from substantial additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers, health plans and individuals, as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under Medicare.\nOn June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate contained in the ACA and modified the Medicaid expansion provisions to make the expansion optional for states. Some states have decided not to participate in the Medicaid expansion, and states currently participating may choose not to participate in the future. Congress may also withhold the funding necessary to fully implement the ACA, may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or could seek to repeal the law altogether. Given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation, implementation, and timing of these changes, which we expect to occur over the next several years, the ACA could change the way we do business, potentially affecting our pricing, benefit design, product mix, geographic mix, and distribution channels.\nNew or amended regulations and policies, as well as future legislative changes, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows by:\n\u2022\nrestricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to expand into new markets;\n\u2022\nincreasing our medical and administrative costs;\n\u2022\nlowering our Medicare payment rates and/or increasing our expenses associated with the non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments;\n\u2022\nencouraging states to contract with organizations that are not subject to the annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment imposed by the ACA (the \"ACA industry fee\") for their Medicaid programs; and\n\u2022\nencouraging states to integrate Medicare and Medicaid using a limited number of health plans or a fee for service model.\nIn addition, the response of other companies to these policy, regulatory and legislative changes and adjustments to their offerings, if any, could have a meaningful effect in the health care markets.\nThe ACA included a number of changes that have affected the way plans operate, such as reduced Medicare premium rates, CMS Star Ratings, minimum medical loss ratios (\"MLR\") and other provisions.\nReduced Medicare Premium Rates\nIn April 2015, the CMS final call letter revised the proposed 2016 rates, which we estimate will result in a rate decrease of approximately 1% compared with our 2015 rates.\nCMS Star Ratings\nCertain provisions in the ACA provide additional Medicare revenue related to the achievement of higher Star Ratings that can be used to offer more attractive benefit packages to members and/or achieve higher profit margins. In addition, plans with Star Ratings of 4.0 or higher are eligible for year-round open enrollment, whereas plans with lower Star Ratings have more restrictions on enrollment criteria and timing. Part C or Part D Medicare plans with Star Ratings of less than three stars for three consecutive years are denoted as \"low performing\" plans on the CMS website and in the CMS \"Medicare and You\" handbook. In addition, CMS could exercise its authority to terminate the MA and PDP contracts for plans rated below three stars for three consecutive years for the plan year 2017. As a result, plans that achieve higher Star Ratings may have a competitive advantage over plans with lower Star Ratings. None of our plans achieved a 4.0 Star Rating in 2015, so we receive less quality-related additional revenue and have more restrictions on benefit design, enrollment criteria and timing than our competitors with higher Star Ratings.\nCMS's current quality measurement methodology does not appropriately account for socio-economic determinants of health. Because we have a greater percentage of lower-income members, we may be unable to achieve a 4.0 Star Rating for some or all of our plans without a legislative or regulatory adjustment to the quality measurement methodology. Though various regulatory and legislative solutions have been proposed, we continue to work with our legislative and regulatory partners to ensure this issue is adequately addressed.\nIn October 2015, CMS announced 2016 MA and PDP Star Ratings. The Star Rating for eight of our 12 MA plans, which serve approximately 73% of our December 31, 2015 MA membership, received an overall rating of 3.0 stars or higher. Our remaining four MA plans each received a score of 2.5 for 2016, and our stand-alone PDPs received a combined score of 2.5 for 2016.\nTwo of our MA contracts have been denoted as \"low performing\" plans by CMS: our MA contract serving Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina and our MA contract serving Louisiana. However, we are working closely with CMS to retain the membership associated with these contracts by consolidating these contracts into other, better-performing contracts held by us. As a result, though our MA contract serving Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina is subject to termination by CMS for the plan year 2017, we do not anticipate this contract to be terminated. We expect that the membership for both of these contracts will be consolidated by January 1, 2017, which will remove the low performing designation.\nMinimum Medical Loss Ratio\nBeginning in 2014, the ACA established a minimum MLR for MA and Part D plans, requiring plans to spend not less than 85% of premiums on medical and pharmacy benefits. The rules implementing the minimum MLR impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum MLR, including requirements to refund to CMS shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan\u2019s MA contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum MLR. The MLR prescribed by HHS differs from the MLR calculation under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and is determined by adding a plan\u2019s spending for clinical services, prescription drugs and other direct patient benefits, plus its total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums (after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees). These provisions have not had a material effect on our results of operations in 2014 or 2015.\nOther Provisions\nUnder the ACA, over a 10-year period beginning in 2010, the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d (i.e., the dollar threshold at which an individual has to pay full price for his or her medications) under Part D has been gradually closing, with beneficiaries retaining a 25% co-pay in 2020. While this change will ultimately result in increased insurance coverage for beneficiaries, such improved\nbenefits could result in changes in member behavior with respect to drug utilization. Such actions could affect the cost structure of our PDPs.\nThe ACA imposed certain new taxes and fees, including limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible, as well as an annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment (the \"ACA industry fee\") on health insurers, which began in 2014. The total ACA industry fee levied on the health insurance industry was $8 billion and $11.3 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively, growing to $14.3 billion by 2018. After 2018, the ACA industry fee increases according to an index based on net premium growth. The assessment is being levied on certain health insurers that provide insurance in the assessment year, and is allocated to health insurers based on each health insurer's share of net premiums for all U.S health insurers in the year preceding the assessment. The ACA industry fee is not deductible for income tax purposes, which has significantly increased our effective income tax rate. On December 18, 2015, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 which, among other provisions, included a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee for 2017.\nWe incurred $137.7 million and $227.3 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our Medicaid state customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes, for 2014 and 2015. Consequently, we recognized $124.6 million and $219.2 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. CMS does not directly reimburse us for the effect of the ACA industry fee related to MA and PDP premiums.\nThe health reforms in the ACA allow, but do not require, states to expand eligibility for Medicaid programs. As a result, the effects of any potential future expansions and future federal financing are uncertain, making it difficult to determine whether the net effect of the ACA will be positive or negative for our Medicaid business.\nFuture changes in health care laws present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFuture changes in, or interpretations to, existing health care laws or regulations, or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations could materially reduce our revenue and/or profitability by, among other things:\n\u2022\nimposing additional license, registration and/or capital requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasing our administrative and other costs;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to change our operating structure;\n\u2022\nrequiring significant additional reporting and technological capabilities;\n\u2022\nimposing additional fees and taxes, which cannot be offset by increased premium revenue;\n\u2022\nincreasing mandated benefits, such as the proposed mental health parity regulation;\n\u2022\nfurther limiting our ability to engage in intra-company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestricting our revenue and enrollment growth;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to restructure our relationships with providers; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems.\nRequirements relating to increased plan information disclosure, expedited appeals and grievance procedures, third party review of certain medical decisions, health plan liability, access to specialists, \u201cclean claim\u201d (a claim for which no additional information is needed), payment methodologies and timing, utilization of mail order pharmacy, administrative simplification, mandatory network inclusion of certain providers, mandated increases in provider reimbursement rates, physician collective bargaining rights, centralized credentialing and confidentiality of medical records either have been enacted or are under consideration. Changes in state law, regulations and rules also may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted in April 2015, which, among other things, preserved and extended the CHIPs funding through fiscal year 2017 and extended the Special Needs Program through 2018. There is no assurance that the CHIPs and Special Needs Programs will be further extended or funded. If these programs are not further funded, renewed or extended, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flow, membership and profitability.\nOur encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain programs.\nOur contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data. The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and, in part, to set premium rates. We have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect or correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been, and continue to be exposed to operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance. In some instances, our government clients have established retroactive requirements for the encounter data we must submit. There also may be periods of time in which we are unable to meet existing requirements. In either case, it may be prohibitively expensive or impossible for us to collect or reconstruct this historical data.\nWe have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data, due to difficulties with providers and third-party vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions. As states increase their reliance on encounter data, these difficulties could affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain programs.\nWe encounter significant competition for program participation, members, network providers, key personnel and sales personnel and our failure to compete successfully may limit our ability to increase or maintain membership in the markets we serve, or have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Some of our competitors are more established in the insurance and health care industries, with larger market share, greater financial resources and better quality scores than we have in some markets. We operate in, and may attempt to acquire business in, programs or markets in which premiums are determined on the basis of a competitive bidding process. In these programs or markets, funding levels established by bidders with significantly different cost structures, target profitability margins or aggressive bidding strategies could negatively affect our ability to maintain or acquire profitable businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe entered into the health insurance exchange business in 2015 and only participated in Kentucky and New York. As a result, individuals who select an exchange product in our other states, and subsequently become eligible for a Medicaid plan that we offer, may be less likely to select or be assigned to us.\nRegulatory reform or other initiatives may bring additional competitors into our markets. Regulators may prefer companies that operate in lines of business in which we do not operate when we bid on new business or renewals of existing business, which may cause our bid or renewal to be unsuccessful.\nWe compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network, benefits provided and quality of service. We may not be able to develop innovative products and services that are attractive to members. We cannot be sure that we will continue to remain competitive, nor can we be sure that we will be able to successfully retain or acquire members for our products and services at current levels of profitability.\nIn addition, we compete with other health plans to contract with hospitals, physicians, pharmacies and other providers for inclusion in our networks that serve government program beneficiaries. We believe providers select plans in which they participate based on several criteria including reimbursement rates, timeliness and accuracy of claims payment, potential to deliver new patient volume and/or retain existing patients, effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints and other factors. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully attract or retain providers under acceptable contract terms to maintain a competitive network in the geographic areas we serve.\nWe are dependent on our senior management and we may not be able retain our senior management or attract and retain other qualified management, clinical and commercial personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel in the managed care and health care industry. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy. In particular, if we lose any members of our senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, and our business may be harmed as a result. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future modify our senior management structure, which could affect our retention of employees and management.\nOur MA plans are sold primarily through our sales personnel, who frequently work with independent brokers, consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business. The independent brokers, consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may also recommend and/or market health care benefit products of our competitors, and we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain sales personnel and third-party brokers, consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education to this sales network regarding our product portfolio, which is complex, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels.\nTo the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve, our ability to retain or increase members and providers, maintain or increase our revenue growth, and control medical cost trends and/or our pricing flexibility, may be adversely affected. Failure to compete successfully in the markets we serve may have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and results of operations.\nRisk-adjustment payment systems make our revenue and results of operations more difficult to estimate and could result in retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nMost of our government customers employ risk-adjustment models to determine the premium amount they pay for each member. This model pays more for members with predictably higher costs according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled. Premium payments are generally established at fixed intervals according to the contract terms, and then adjusted on a retroactive basis. We reassess the estimates of the risk adjustment settlements each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to premium revenue. In addition, revisions by our government customers to the risk-adjustment models have reduced, and may continue to reduce, our premium revenue.\nAs a result of the variability of certain factors that determine estimates for risk-adjusted premiums, including plan risk scores, the actual amount of retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. Consequently, our estimate of our plans\u2019 risk scores for any period, and any resulting change in our accrual of premium revenues related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The data provided to our government customers to determine the risk score are subject to audit by them even after the annual settlements occur. These audits may result in the refund of premiums to the government customer previously received by us, which could be significant and would reduce our premium revenue in the year that repayment is required.\nGovernment customers have performed and continue to perform audits of selected plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each member. We anticipate that CMS will continue to conduct audits of our contracts and contract years on an on-going basis. An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. It is likely that a payment adjustment could occur as a result of these audits, and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and risk of litigation, and any actual or alleged violation by us of the terms of our contracts, applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than stockholders and creditors. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer, and how we interact with our members, providers and the public. Any actual or alleged violation by us of applicable laws or regulations could reduce our revenues and profitability, thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face a significant risk of class action lawsuits and other litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses. The following are examples of types of potential litigation and regulatory investigations we face:\n\u2022\nclaims by government agencies relating to compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to sales practices;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to the denial or delay of health care benefit payments;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to claims payments and procedures;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to provider marketing;\n\u2022\nclaims by providers for network termination or exclusion;\n\u2022\nanti-kickback claims;\n\u2022\nmedical malpractice or negligence actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers\u2019 malpractice or negligence;\n\u2022\nallegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities;\n\u2022\nprovider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts or defamation claims;\n\u2022\nallegations of discrimination;\n\u2022\nallegations of breaches of duties;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to inadequate or incorrect disclosure or accounting in our public filings and other statements;\n\u2022\nallegations of agent misconduct;\n\u2022\nclaims related to deceptive trade practices;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to audits and contract performance;\n\u2022\nprotests related to Medicaid awards; and\n\u2022\nviolations of state procurement laws and policies.\nAs we contract with various governmental agencies to provide managed health care services, we are subject to various reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit, investigation or result from litigation could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in government-sponsored programs, including Medicaid and Medicare;\n\u2022\nforfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts;\n\u2022\nimposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, fines or other sanctions on us and/or our key associates;\n\u2022\nreduction or limitation of our membership;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation in various markets;\n\u2022\nincreased difficulty in marketing our products and services;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain approval for future acquisitions or service or geographic expansion;\n\u2022\nsuspension or loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer, HMO or third party administrator or to otherwise provide a service; and\n\u2022\nan event of default under our debt agreements.\nIn particular, because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute suit against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek treble damages, penalties and assessments. Many states, including states where we currently operate, have enacted parallel legislation. Liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know, or it is found that we should have known, that information we provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent.\nSome courts have permitted False Claims Act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements. Liability for such matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Qui tam, or \"whistleblower\" actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of health care companies to defend false claim actions, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other state or federal health care programs as a result of investigations arising out of such actions.\nFor example, in October 2008, the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cCivil Division\u201d) informed us that as part of its civil inquiry, it was investigating four complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act. We also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed an action in state court for Leon County, Florida against several defendants, including us and one of our subsidiaries. With respect to these actions, we reached a settlement with the Civil Division, the Civil Division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida, and the Civil Division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Connecticut. However, other such actions may have been filed against us of which we are presently unaware, or other similar actions may be filed against us in the future.\nWe are currently undergoing standard periodic audits by several state agencies and CMS to verify compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations. For additional risks associated with these audits, see \u201cRisk-adjustment payment systems make our revenue and results of operations more difficult to estimate and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows\u201d above.\nIn addition, there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and the payments they receive. These have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling those companies\u2019 products. For example, CMS and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market Medicare products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and/or changes to industry practices, which could adversely affect our ability to market our products.\nWe rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by our government clients to collect premiums, and any inaccuracies in those lists may cause states to recoup premium payments from us, which could materially reduce our revenues and results of operations.\nPremium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by our government clients. A state will require us to reimburse it for premiums that we received from the state based on an eligibility list that it later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government-sponsored program, have been enrolled twice in the same program, have secondary insurance, are eligible for a different premium category or are eligible for a different program. Our review of remittance files may not identify all member eligibility errors and could result in repayment of premiums in years subsequent to the year in which the revenue was recorded. We have established a reserve in anticipation of recoupment by the states of previously paid premiums that we believe to be erroneous, but ultimately our reserve may not be sufficient to cover the amount, if any, of recoupments. If the amount of any recoupment exceeds our reserves, our revenues could be materially reduced and it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition to recoupment of premiums previously paid, we also face the risk that a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our results of operations would be reduced as a result of the state\u2019s failure to pay us for related payments we made to providers and were unable to recoup.\nIf we are unable to access sufficient capital, whether as a result of difficulties finding acceptable public or private financing, restrictions under our credit agreement, restrictions under our Senior Notes, restrictions on dividend payments from our subsidiaries, or higher levels of required statutory capital, we may be unable to grow or maintain our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business strategy has been defined by four long-term business priorities, one of which includes our ability to enter new markets by pursuing attractive growth opportunities for our existing product lines. We may need to access the debt or equity markets and receive dividends from our subsidiaries to fund these growth activities.\nOur ability to enter new markets may be hindered in situations where financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Financing may only be available to us with unfavorable terms such as high rates of interest, restrictive covenants and other restrictions that could impede our ability to profitably operate our business and increase the expected rate of return we require to enter new markets, making such efforts unfeasible.\nOur credit agreement and Senior Notes have restrictions on our ability to secure additional capital. Our substantial indebtedness and restrictive covenants:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nexpose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreement is variable.\nOur debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. If our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to comply with the financial covenants in the credit agreement or to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt, which could harm our long-term business prospects.\nOur credit agreement and Senior Notes also contain various restrictions and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility, including our ability to grow our business or declare dividends without lender approval. If we fail to pay any of our indebtedness when due, or if we breach any of the other covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, one or more events of default may be triggered. If we are unable to obtain a waiver, these events of default could permit our creditors to declare all amounts owed to be immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, in most states, we are required to seek the prior approval of state regulatory authorities to transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts or, in some states, any amount. If our state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and/or distributions by certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non-regulated subsidiaries, our liquidity, unregulated cash flows, business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur licensed HMO and insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital and maintenance of certain financial ratios, as defined by each state. States may raise the statutory capital level from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nOur subsidiaries also may be required to maintain higher levels of statutory capital. Our subsidiaries are subject to their state regulators' general oversight powers. Regardless of whether a state adopts the risk-based capital requirements, the state's regulators can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interests of our members and other constituents. For example, if premium rates are inadequate, reduced profits or losses in our regulated subsidiaries may cause regulators to increase the amount of capital required. Any additional capital contribution made to one or more of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and growth potential. In addition, increases of statutory capital requirements could cause us to withdraw from certain programs or markets where it becomes economically difficult to continue operating profitably.\nOur indemnification obligations and the limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUnder Delaware law, our charter and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors, officers and associates with respect to current and future investigations and litigation. In connection with some pending matters, including the criminal trial of certain of our former executives and associates, we are required to, or we have otherwise agreed to, advance, and have advanced, significant legal fees and related expenses and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending. We have exhausted our insurance for the expenses associated with the criminal trial of our former executive officers and associates, and the related government investigations that commenced in 2007, and further expenses incurred by us for these matters will not be reimbursed.\nWe currently maintain insurance in the amount of $125.0 million, which provides coverage for our independent directors and officers hired after January 24, 2008 for certain potential matters to the extent they occur after October 2007. We cannot provide any assurances that pending claims, or claims yet to arise, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the securities and debt markets, which could affect our investment portfolio and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur investment portfolio represents a significant portion of our assets and is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. Market fluctuations in the securities and credit markets could affect the value or liquidity, of our investment portfolio and adversely affect interest income. As a result, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity which may materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nWe are subject to laws and government regulations that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions favorable to stockholders.\nOur operating subsidiaries are subject to state laws that require prior regulatory approval for any change of control of an HMO or insurance company. For purposes of these laws, in most states \"control\" of an entity is presumed to exist when a person, group of persons or entity acquires the power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of that entity, subject to certain exceptions. These laws may discourage acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our company, including through transactions, and in particular through unsolicited transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions that some or all of our stockholders find favorable.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile and future sales of our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, the price and trading volume of our common stock, as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry, may experience periods of significant volatility. Company-specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry (including the regulatory environment) and the capital markets and the economy in general may cause this volatility. Our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our or the market's expectations about our future operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our Company or the health care industry generally;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends in our markets;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in the laws, regulations and policies affecting our business;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in our senior management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\nthe risks described in \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u201d above.\nWe may issue equity securities in the future, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC under which we may offer from time to time an indeterminate amount of any combination of debt securities, common and preferred stock and warrants. The registration statement allows us to seek additional financing, subject to the SEC's rules and regulations relating to eligibility to use Form S-3. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities, including sales of shares in connection with any future acquisitions, could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. These sales may have a harmful effect on prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at a time and price favorable to us. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase a pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we have authority to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nIf we are unable to maintain effective and secure management information systems and applications, successfully update or expand processing capability, or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs we could experience operational disruptions and other materially adverse consequences to our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends on effective and secure information systems, applications and operations. The information gathered, processed and stored by our management information systems assists us in, among other things, marketing and sales, membership tracking, billing, claims processing, medical management, medical care cost and utilization trending, financial and management accounting, reporting, and planning and analysis. These systems also support our customer service functions, provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analysis of medical expenses and outcome data. These systems remain subject to unexpected interruptions resulting from occurrences such as hardware failures or increased demand. There can be no assurance that such interruptions will not occur in the future, and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, operating and other issues can lead to data problems that affect the performance of important functions, including, but not limited to, claims payment, customer service and financial reporting.\nThere can also be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our operations, complying with contractual data requirements and improving service levels will not be delayed or that system issues will not arise in the future. Our information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs. If we are unable to maintain or expand our systems, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis, loss of members, difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory problems, difficulty in improving quality, increases in administrative expenses and write-offs of our expenditures in unsuccessful capital investments.\nAdditionally, events outside our control, including terrorism or acts of nature such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or fires, could significantly impair our information systems, applications and critical business functions. To help ensure continued operations in the event that our primary operations are rendered inoperable, we have a disaster recovery plan to recover critical business functionality within stated timelines. Our plan may not operate effectively during an actual disaster and our operations and critical business functions could be disrupted, which would have a material adverse effect on business and our results of operations.\nOur costs to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information could be significant, and any disruptions or security breaches in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches.\nFailure to keep our computer networks, information technology systems, computers and programs and our members\u2019 and customers\u2019 sensitive information secure from attack, damage or unauthorized access, whether as a result of our action or inaction or that of one of our business associates or other vendors, could adversely affect our reputation, membership and revenues and also expose us to mandatory disclosure to the media, contract termination, litigation (including class action litigation), and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and/or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, operating results or financial condition.\nOur measures to prevent security breaches may not be successful. As we expand our business, including through acquisitions and organic growth, increase the amount of information we make available to members and consumers on mobile devices and expand our use of social media, our exposure to these data security and related cybersecurity risks, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage or unauthorized access, increases, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), one part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d), modified certain provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) by, among other things, extending the privacy and security provisions to business associates, mandating new regulations around electronic health records, expanding enforcement mechanisms, and increasing penalties for violations. Civil penalties for HIPAA violations by covered entities are up to an annual maximum of $1.5 million for uncorrected violations based on willful neglect. HHS is required to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance. Investigations of violations that indicate willful neglect, for which penalties became mandatory in February 2011, are statutorily required. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nIn addition, the HITECH Act requires us to notify affected individuals, HHS and, in some cases, the media, when unsecured personal health information is subject to a security breach.\nThe HITECH Act also contains a number of provisions that provide incentives for states to initiate certain programs related to health care and health care technology, such as electronic health records. While provisions such as these do not apply to us directly, states wishing to apply for grants under the HITECH Act, or otherwise participating in such programs, may impose new health care technology requirements on us through our contracts with state Medicaid agencies. We are unable to predict what such requirements may entail or what their effect on our business may be.\nOn January 25, 2013, HHS, as required by the HITECH Act, issued the Final Omnibus Rules that provide final modifications to HIPAA rules to implement the HITECH Act. The various requirements of the HITECH Act have different compliance dates, some of which have passed and some of which will occur in the future. We will continue to assess our compliance obligations as regulations under HIPAA, as modified by the HITECH Act, continue to become effective and more\nguidance becomes available from HHS and other federal agencies. The evolving privacy and security requirements, however, may require substantial operational and systems changes, associate education and resources and there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement them adequately or prior to their effective date. Given HIPAA\u2019s complexity and the evolving regulations, which may be subject to changing and perhaps conflicting interpretation, our ongoing ability to comply with all of the HIPAA requirements is uncertain, which may expose us to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under the HITECH Act and may require us to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements.\nOur business could be adversely affected by adoption of the new ICD-10 standardized coding set for diagnoses.\nHHS has released rules pursuant to HIPAA, which mandate the use of standard formats in electronic health care transactions. HHS also has published rules requiring the use of standardized code sets and unique identifiers for providers. On October 1, 2015, the federal government required that health care organizations, including health insurers, upgrade to updated and expanded standardized code sets used for documenting health conditions. These new standardized code sets, known as ICD-10, has required and will continue to require substantial investments from health care organizations, including us. While use of the ICD-10 code sets will require significant administrative changes, the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, these changes may result in errors and otherwise negatively affect our service levels, and we may experience complications related to supporting customers that are not fully compliant with the revised requirements as of the applicable compliance date. Furthermore, if physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for services provided as a result of the new coding set, we may not be reimbursed, or adequately reimbursed, for such services. In addition, claims not submitted in a timely manner as result of the ICD-10 implementation may affect our ability to make accurate estimates of medical benefits expense.", "PERMNO": 90272, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "WCG"}
