{"cik": "1634447", "company": "PECK Co HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors contained in this Annual Report and in our filings with the SEC, including our Definitive Proxy Statement filed on June 3, 2019 (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d), as well as all of the information contained in any prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus and amendments thereto, before you decide to invest in our Common Stock. Our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any of such risks. The value of our Common Stock could decline as a result of any of these risks. You could lose all or part of your investment in our Common Stock. Some of our statements in sections entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d are forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on general market and economic conditions has yet to be determined and is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has resulted in widespread disruption to capital markets and general economic and business climate. It is too early for us to predict the long-term effects of this health crisis. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. On March 16, 2020, in response to intensifying efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, we temporarily limited access to headquarters and began implementing remote work environments for our employees. On March 25, 2020, we closed our headquarters and advised all employees to work remotely until more guidance is provided. We continue to monitor the outbreak of COVID-19 to help ensure the health and safety of our associates and our customers. We are also continuing to communicate with our suppliers regarding the flow of product and potential temporary effects on our supply chain. On April 10, 2020, Governor Phil Scott extended Vermont\u2019s State of Emergency and all existing mitigation orders and closures until May 15. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of business disruption and the related financial affect cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We continue to provide service and maintenance in support of critical infrastructure including utilities and telecommunications. The extent to which COVID-19 affects our results, or those of our suppliers, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions and related costs to contain or treat it, among others.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have had an extensive and profitable operating history, with the exception of 2019, but it may be difficult to accurately evaluate our future business and prospects.\nAlthough we were founded in 1972, we did not begin selling solar systems until 2013 when our management believed that solar asset investment was profitable. Our management believes that our success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to successfully sell solar systems in the Northeast and in other states against determined competition, and to consummate synergistic acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will operate profitably or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur management discovered a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as required to be implemented by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nWe are currently subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and are required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls. Our management has identified control deficiencies and the need for a stronger internal controls environment relating to revenue activities. The ineffectiveness of the design, implementation and operation of the controls surrounding these matters creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, our management concluded that this deficiency represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. Although our management has taken significant steps to remediate this weakness, our management can give no assurance yet that all the measures it has taken will on a permanent and sustainable basis remediate the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting or that any other material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future. We plan to take steps to remedy this material weakness. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the future, we will not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may require substantial additional funding which may not be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise the necessary additional capital, we may be unable to achieve growth of our operations.\nOur historical operation has been profitable, with the exception of 2019. However, in order to grow our operations, we may increase our spending to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our organic growth or corporate acquisitions. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and strategy.\nIn order to carry out our business plan and implement our strategy, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing from time to time, and we may choose to raise additional funds through strategic collaborations, public or private equity or debt financing, bank lines of credit, asset sales, government grants, or other arrangements. Our management cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity or equity-related financing obtained may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt or equity financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs.\nAn inability to raise capital when needed could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause our stock price to decline or require that it cease operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nA material reduction in the retail price of traditional utility generated electricity or electricity from other sources could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur management believes that a significant number of our customers decide to buy solar energy because they want to pay less for electricity than what is offered by the traditional utilities.\nThe customer\u2019s decision to choose solar energy may also be affected by the cost of other renewable energy sources. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the traditional utilities or from other renewable energy sources would harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and could harm our business. The price of electricity from traditional utilities could decrease as a result of:\n\u25cf construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, including plants utilizing natural gas, nuclear, coal, renewable energy or other generation technologies;\n\u25cf relief of transmission constraints that enable local centers to generate energy less expensively;\n\u25cf reductions in the price of natural gas;\n\u25cf utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation;\n\u25cf energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption;\n\u25cf development of new or lower-cost energy storage technologies that have the ability to reduce a customer\u2019s average cost of electricity by shifting load to off-peak times; or\n\u25cf development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy.\nA reduction in utility electricity prices would make the purchase or the lease of our solar energy systems less economically attractive. If the retail price of energy available from traditional utilities were to decrease due to any of these reasons, or other reasons, we would be at a competitive disadvantage, may be unable to attract new customers and our growth would be limited.\nExisting electric utility industry regulations, and changes to regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy systems that may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.\nFederal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities, heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States, governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies. These regulations and policies could deter customers from purchasing renewable energy, including solar energy systems. This could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar energy systems. For example, utilities commonly charge fees to larger, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back-up purposes. These fees could increase our customers\u2019 cost to use our systems and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, depending on the region, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most effectively with expensive peak-hour electricity from the electric grid, rather than the less expensive average price of electricity. Modifications to the utilities\u2019 peak hour pricing policies or rate design, such as to a flat rate, would require us to lower the price of our solar energy systems to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid.\nIn addition, any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce our competitiveness and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, certain jurisdictions have proposed assessing fees on customers purchasing energy from solar energy systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar energy system customers who utilize net metering, either of which would increase the cost of energy to those customers and could reduce demand for our solar energy systems. It is possible charges could be imposed on not just future customers but our existing customers, causing a potentially significant consumer relations problem and harming our reputation and business. Due to the current concentration of our business in Vermont, any such changes in these markets would be particularly harmful to our business, results of operations, and future growth.\nOur growth strategy depends on the widespread adoption of solar power technology.\nThe market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving, and our future success is uncertain. If solar power technology proves unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment or if demand for solar power products fails to develop sufficiently, we would be unable to generate enough revenues to achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flow. The factors influencing the widespread adoption of solar power technology include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf cost-effectiveness of solar power technologies as compared with conventional and non-solar alternative energy technologies;\n\u25cf performance and reliability of solar power products as compared with conventional and non-solar alternative energy products;\n\u25cf fluctuations in economic and market conditions which impact the viability of conventional and non-solar alternative energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels;\n\u25cf continued deregulation of the electric power industry and broader energy industry; and\n\u25cf availability of governmental subsidies and incentives.\nOur business currently depends on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The expiration, elimination or reduction of these rebates, credits and incentives would adversely impact our business.\nU.S. federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation. These governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives enhance the return on investment for our customers and incent them to purchase solar systems. These incentives enables us to lower the price that we charge customers for energy and for solar energy systems. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.\nReductions in, or eliminations or expirations of, governmental incentives could adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to compete in our industry, causing us to increase the prices of our solar energy systems, and reducing the size of our addressable market. In addition, this would adversely impact our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds and our ability to offer attractive financing to prospective customers.\nOur business depends in part on the regulatory treatment of third-party owned solar energy systems.\nOur leases and any power purchase agreements are third-party ownership arrangements. Sales of electricity by third parties face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. Other challenges pertain to whether third-party owned systems qualify for the same levels of rebates or other non-tax incentives available for customer-owned solar energy systems, whether third-party owned systems are eligible at all for these incentives, and whether third-party owned systems are eligible for net metering and the associated significant cost savings. Reductions in, or eliminations of, this treatment of these third-party arrangements could reduce demand for our systems, adversely impact our access to capital and could cause us to increase the price that we charge our customers for energy.\nOur ability to provide solar energy systems to customers on an economically viable basis depends on our ability to help customers arrange financing for such systems.\nOur solar energy systems have been eligible for federal investment tax credits or U.S. Treasury grants, as well as depreciation benefits. We have relied on, and will continue to rely on, financing structures that monetize a substantial portion of those benefits and provide financing for our solar energy systems. With the lapse of the U.S. Treasury grant program, we anticipate that our customers\u2019 reliance on these tax-advantaged financing structures will increase substantially. If, for any reason, our customers were unable to continue to monetize those benefits through these arrangements, we may be unable to provide and maintain solar energy systems for new customers on an economically viable basis.\nThe availability of this tax-advantaged financing depends upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the state of financial and credit markets;\n\u25cf changes in the legal or tax risks associated with these financings; and\n\u25cf non-renewal of these incentives or decreases in the associated benefits.\nU.S. Treasury grants are no longer available for new solar energy systems. Changes in existing law and interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts could reduce the willingness of funding sources to provide funds to customers of these solar energy systems. We cannot assure you that this type of financing will be available to our customers. If, for any reason, we are unable to find financing for solar energy systems, we may no longer be able to provide solar energy systems to new customers on an economically viable basis. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRising interest rates could adversely impact our business.\nIncreases in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing our cost of capital, which would increase our interest expense and make acquisitions more expensive to undertake.\nFurther, rising interest rates may negatively impact our ability to arrange financing for our customers on favorable terms to facilitate our customers\u2019 purchases of our solar energy systems. The majority of our cash flows to date have been from the sales of solar energy systems. Rising interest rates may have the effect of depressing the sales of solar energy systems because many consumers finance their purchases.\nAs a result, an increase in interest rates may negatively affect our costs and reduce our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we cannot compete successfully against other solar and energy companies, we may not be successful in developing our operations and our business may suffer.\nThe solar and energy industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances, both in the United States and internationally. We compete with solar companies with business models that are similar to ours. In addition, we compete with solar companies in the downstream value chain of solar energy. For example, we face competition from purely finance driven organizations that acquire customers and then subcontract out the installation of solar energy systems, from installation businesses that seek financing from external parties, from large construction companies and utilities, and increasingly from sophisticated electrical and roofing companies. Some of these competitors specialize in the residential solar energy market, and some may provide energy at lower costs than we do. Further, some competitors are integrating vertically in order to ensure supply and to control costs. Many of our competitors also have significant brand name recognition and have extensive knowledge of our target markets.\nIf we are unable to complete in the market, we will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions may have material adverse consequences on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnpredictable and unstable changes in economic conditions, including recession, inflation, increased government intervention, or other changes, may adversely affect our general business strategy. We rely upon our ability to generate additional sources of liquidity and we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund existing operations or to take advantage of opportunities, including acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies. Any adverse event would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is concentrated in certain markets, putting it at risk of region-specific disruptions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, a vast majority of our total installations were in Vermont. Our management expects our near-term future growth to occur throughout the Northeastern United States, and to further expand our customer base and operational infrastructure. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are particularly susceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, political, weather and other conditions in such markets and in other markets that may become similarly concentrated.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified technicians and advisors, or if our key executives, key employees or consultants discontinue their employment or consulting relationship with us, we may delay our development efforts or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management or technical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among solar, energy, and other businesses. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. If we are not able to attract, retain, and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the successful development of any product candidates, our ability to raise additional capital, and our ability to implement our overall business strategy.\nWe are highly dependent on members of our management and technical staff. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior technical personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers, key employees, or consultants and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among solar and energy companies. Certain of our current officers, directors, and/or consultants hereafter appointed may from time to time serve as officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants of other solar and energy companies. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. Other than certain members of our senior management team, all of our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, each employee may leave our employment and join a competitor at any time.\nWe plan to grant stock options, restricted stock grants, or other forms of equity awards in the future as a method of attracting and retaining employees, motivating performance, and aligning the interests of employees with those of our stockholders. If we are unable to implement and maintain equity compensation arrangements that provide sufficient incentives, we may be unable to retain our existing employees and attract additional qualified candidates. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and attract additional qualified candidates, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe execution of our business plan and development strategy may be seriously harmed if integration of our senior management team is not successful.\nAs our business continues to grow and in the event that we acquire new businesses, we may experience significant changes in our senior management team. Failure to integrate our Board of Directors and senior management teams may negatively affect the operations of our business.\nWe may not successfully implement our business model.\nOur business model is predicated on our ability to build and sell solar systems at a profit, and through organic growth, geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions. Our management intends to continue to operate our business as it has previously, with sourcing and marketing methods that we have used successfully in the past. However, our management cannot assure you that our methods will continue to attract new customers nor that we can maintain profitability in the very competitive solar systems marketplace.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nOur future growth, if any, may cause a significant strain on our management and our operational, financial, and other resources. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to implement and improve our operational, financial, and management systems and to expand, train, manage, and motivate our employees. These demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional expertise by our management. Any increase in resources used without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial, and management systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nIn the future, we may acquire companies, project pipelines, products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition or any other future acquisition, and any acquisition has numerous risks. These risks include the following:\n\u25cf difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u25cf difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current technologies;\n\u25cf difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to retain key customers, vendors, and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u25cf incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact operating results;\n\u25cf potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal and financial liabilities, among other things;\n\u25cf potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective; and\n\u25cf potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions.\nMergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and, if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWith respect to providing electricity on a price-competitive basis, solar systems face competition from traditional regulated electric utilities, from less-regulated third party energy service providers and from new renewable energy companies.\nThe solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with large traditional utilities. We believe that our primary competitors are the traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers. Traditional utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote more resources to the research, development, promotion, and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Traditional utilities could also offer other value-added products or services that could help them to compete with us even if the cost of electricity they offer is higher than that of ours. In addition, a majority of utilities\u2019 sources of electricity is non-solar, which may allow utilities to sell electricity more cheaply than electricity generated by our solar energy systems.\nWe also compete with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities, but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. These energy service companies are able to offer customers electricity supply-only solutions that are competitive with our solar energy system options on both price and usage of renewable energy technology while avoiding the long-term agreements and physical installations that our current fund-financed business model requires. This may limit our ability to attract new customers; particularly those who wish to avoid long-term contracts or have an aesthetic or other objection to putting solar panels on their roofs.\nAs the solar industry grows and evolves, we will also face new competitors who are not currently in the market. Low technological barriers to entry characterize our industry and well-capitalized companies could choose to enter the market and compete with it. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors will limit our growth and will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nDevelopments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may materially adversely affect demand for our offerings.\nSignificant developments in alternative technologies, such as advances in other forms of distributed solar power generation, storage solutions such as batteries, the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways management does not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay deployment of our solar energy systems, which could result in product obsolescence, the loss of competitiveness of our systems, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.\nDue to the limited number of suppliers in our industry, the acquisition of any of these suppliers by a competitor or any shortage, delay, price change, imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation in our ability to obtain components or technologies that we use could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, and loss of market share.\nWhile we purchase our products from several different suppliers, if one or more of the suppliers on which we rely to meet anticipated demand ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, is acquired by a competitor or otherwise is unable to increase production as industry demand increases, or is otherwise unable to allocate sufficient production to us, it may be difficult for us to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. There are a limited number of suppliers of solar energy system components and technologies. While we believe there are other sources of supply for these products available, transitioning to a new supplier may result in additional costs and delays in acquiring our solar products and deploying our systems. These issues could harm our business or financial performance.\nIn addition, the acquisition of a component supplier or technology provider by one of our competitors could limit our access to such components or technologies and require significant redesigns of our solar energy systems or installation procedures and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere have also been periods of industry-wide shortages of key components, including solar panels, in times of industry disruption. The manufacturing infrastructure for some of these components has a long lead-time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components. The solar industry is frequently experiencing significant disruption and, as a result, shortages of key components, including solar panels, may be more likely to occur, which in turn may result in price increases for such components. Even if industry-wide shortages do not occur, suppliers may decide to allocate key components with high demand or insufficient production capacity to more profitable customers, customers with long-term supply agreements or customers other than us and our supply of such components may be reduced as a result.\nTypically, we purchase the components for our solar energy systems on an as-needed basis and do not operate under long-term supply agreements. The vast majority of our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Since our revenue is also generated in U.S. dollars, we are mostly insulated from currency fluctuations. However, since our suppliers often incur a significant amount of their costs by purchasing raw materials and generating operating expenses in foreign currencies, if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly or for a prolonged period of time against these other currencies, this may cause our suppliers to raise the prices they charge us, which could harm our financial results. Since we purchase most of the solar photovoltaic modules that we use from China, we are particularly exposed to exchange rate risk from increases in the value of the Chinese Renminbi. Any supply shortages, delays, price changes or other limitation in our ability to obtain components or technologies that we use could limit our growth, cause cancellations or adversely affect our profitability, and result in loss of market share and damage to our brand.\nWe act as the licensed general contractor for our customers and are subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns, delays, regulatory compliance and other contingencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are a licensed contractor and we are normally the general contractor, electrician, construction manager, and installer for our solar energy systems. We may be liable to customers for any damage that we cause to the home, belongings or property of our customers during the installation of our systems. For example, we penetrate our customers\u2019 roofs during the installation process and may incur liability for the failure to adequately weatherproof such penetrations following the completion of installation of solar energy systems. In addition, because the solar energy systems that we deploy are high-voltage energy systems, we may incur liability for the failure to comply with electrical standards and manufacturer recommendations. Because our profit on a particular installation is based in part on assumptions as to the cost of such project, cost overruns, delays, or other execution issues may cause us to not achieve our expected results or cover our costs for that project.\nIn addition, the installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national, state, and local laws and ordinances relating to building, fire and electrical codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering, and related matters. We also rely on certain employees to maintain professional licenses in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our failure to employ properly licensed personnel could adversely affect our licensing status in those jurisdictions. It is difficult and costly to track the requirements of every authority having jurisdiction over our operations and our solar energy systems. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems, or changes to existing government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems, may result in significant additional expenses to our customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our systems.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems throughout our company to process orders, manage inventory, process and bill shipments and collect cash from our customers, respond to customer inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment, and record and pay amounts due vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adversely affect our overall business operation.\nCompliance with occupational safety and health requirements and best practices can be costly, and noncompliance with such requirements may result in potentially significant monetary penalties, operational delays, and adverse publicity.\nThe installation of solar energy systems requires our employees to work at heights with complicated and potentially dangerous electrical systems. The evaluation and modification of buildings as part of the installation process requires our employees to work in locations that may contain potentially dangerous levels of asbestos, lead, mold or other materials known or believed to be hazardous to human health. We also maintain a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to support our installers and operations. There is substantial risk of serious injury or death if proper safety procedures are not followed. Our operations are subject to regulation under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), and equivalent state laws. Changes to OSHA or DOT requirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could result in increased costs. If we fail to comply with applicable OSHA regulations, even if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial penalties, incur significant capital expenditures or suspend or limit operations. While we have not experienced a high level of injuries to date, high injury rates could expose us to increased liability. In the past, we have had workplace accidents and received citations from OSHA regulators for alleged safety violations, resulting in fines. Any such accidents, citations, violations, injuries or failure to comply with industry best practices may subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect our business.\nProblems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.\nIf our products fail to perform as expected while under warranty, or if we are unable to support the warranties, sales of our products may be adversely affected, or our costs may increase, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may also be subject to warranty or product liability claims against us that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of our available insurance limits. In addition, quality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation. The possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expenses to repair or replace defective products. Furthermore, widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and reduce our market share causing sales to decline.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe often find that some customers tend to book projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end. This results in third and fourth quarter sales being more robust usually at the expense of the first quarter. In the future, this seasonality may cause fluctuations in financial results. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality that we experience may change.\nA failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our interactions with current or prospective commercial or residential customers could result in negative publicity, claims, investigations, and litigation, and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business includes contracts and transactions with commercial and residential customers. We must comply with numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern matters relating to our interactions with residential consumers, including those pertaining to privacy and data security, consumer financial and credit transactions, home improvement contracts, warranties, and door-to-door solicitation. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations, or enact new laws and regulations, regarding these matters. Changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect how we do business, acquire customers, and manage and use information that we collect from and about current and prospective customers and the costs associated therewith. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our interactions with residential customers. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Non-compliance with any such law or regulations could also expose us to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments, including non-U.S. governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Company\nBecause we were previously considered to be a \u201cshell company\u201d under applicable securities laws and regulations, investors may not be able to rely on the resale exemption provided by Rule 144 of the Securities Act until certain requirements have been satisfied. As a result, investors may not be able to easily re-sell our securities and could lose their entire investment.\nPrior to the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we were considered to be a \u201cshell company\u201d under Rule 405 of Regulation C of the Securities Act. A \u201cshell company\u201d is a company with either no or nominal operations or assets, or assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. As a result, our shareholders will not be allowed to rely on Rule 144 of the Securities Act for a period of one year from the date on which we ceased to be a shell company. Because shareholders may not be able to rely on an exemption for the resale of their securities other than Rule 144, they may not be able to easily re-sell our securities in the future and could lose their entire investment as a result. See \u201cShares Eligible For Future Sale - Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies\u201d.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we will cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. We cannot predict if investors will find shares of our Common Stock less attractive or us less comparable to certain other public companies because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our Common Stock price may be more volatile.\nPursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls effective December 31, 2019. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period and, as a result, we must comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nIf we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of Nasdaq, Nasdaq could delist our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is currently listed on Nasdaq. In order to maintain such listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards. Although we are currently in compliance with such listing standards, we may in the future fall out of compliance with such standards. If we are unable to maintain compliance with these Nasdaq requirements, our Common Stock will be delisted from Nasdaq.\nOur Common Stock currently trades on Nasdaq, and, to date, trading of our Common Stock has been limited. If a more active market does not develop, it may be difficult for you to sell the Common Stock you own or result in your sale at a price that is less than the price you paid.\nTo date, trading of our Common Stock on Nasdaq has been limited and there can be no assurance that there will be a more active market for our Common Stock either now or in the future. If a more active and liquid trading market does not develop or if developed cannot be sustained, you may have difficulty selling any of the shares of Common Stock that you purchased. The market price for our Common Stock may decline below the price you paid, and you may not be able to sell your shares of Common Stock at or above the price you paid, or at all.\nIn the event that our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, U.S. broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock because they may be considered penny stocks and thus be subject to the penny stock rules.\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restricts transactions involving stock which is deemed to be penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on NASDAQ if current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Our shares of Common Stock have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares of common stock and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf A classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to the change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an Annual or Special Meeting of our Stockholders;\n\u25cf the requirement that an Annual Meeting of Stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive officer, or the Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u25cf controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf providing that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our Board of Directors and management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding Common Stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding Common Stock. Any provision of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Offerings and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe sale or issuance of our Common Stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of Common Stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our Common Stock to fall.\nOn September 26, 2019, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $15,000,000 of our Common Stock. Upon the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 81,263 Commitment Shares to Lincoln Park in consideration for Lincoln Park\u2019s commitment to purchase shares of our Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement and we may issue up to an additional 40,937 shares of Common Stock pro rata in connection with each purchase made by Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The remaining shares of our Common Stock that may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 24-month period commencing after the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price for the shares of our Common Stock that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our Common Stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our Common Stock to fall.\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of our shares to Lincoln Park. Additional sales of our Common Stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some or none of the shares of our Common Stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. If and when we do sell shares of our Common Stock to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired such shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of such shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our shares of Common Stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe may require additional financing to sustain our operations, without which we may not be able to continue operations, and the terms of subsequent financings may adversely impact our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital of $362,586 and had a net loss of $427,795 for the year ended December 31, 2019. We will need additional funds in the future to continue our operations.\nWe may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $15,000,000 worth of shares of our Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement over a 24-month period, generally in amounts up to 50,000 shares of our Common Stock, which may be increased to up to 100,000 shares of our Common Stock depending on the market price of our Common Stock at the time of sale, and, in each case, subject to a maximum limit of $250,000 per purchase, subject to certain exceptions, on any single business day (such share amounts being subject to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction as provided in the Purchase Agreement). Assuming a purchase price of $1.73 per share (the closing sale price of the Common Stock on March 27, 2020) and the purchase by Lincoln Park of 50,000 shares of Common Stock, gross proceeds to us would be $86,500.\nThe extent that we rely on Lincoln Park as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including, the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Even if we sell all $15,000,000 of Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement to Lincoln Park, we may still need additional capital to finance our future production plans and working capital needs, and we may have to raise funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Depending on the type and the terms of any financing we pursue, stockholders\u2019 rights and the value of their investment in our Common Stock could be reduced. A financing could involve one or more types of securities including Common Stock, preferred stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire Common Stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our Common Stock. In addition, if we issue secured debt securities, the holders of the debt would have a claim to our assets that would be prior to the rights of stockholders until the debt is paid. Interest on these debt securities would increase costs and negatively impact operating results. If the issuance of new securities results in diminished rights to holders of our Common Stock, the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively impacted.\nShould the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from our sale of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park, you may not agree with how we use the proceeds and the proceeds may not be invested successfully.\nOur management will have broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from our sale of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park, and we could use them for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of commencement of this offering. Accordingly, you will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of those net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possible that, pending their use, we may invest those net proceeds in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for us. The failure of our management to use such funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Exchange Agreement contains certain \u201cearnout\u201d provisions that, if achieved on or before June 30, 2020, would require the Company to issue 1,167,503 additional shares of Common Stock which would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could cause the price of our Common Stock to fall.\nOn June 20, 2019, as part of the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we entered into an Exchange Agreement that contained certain \u201cearnout\u201d provisions. While we have deemed that the probability of such provisions being achieved is highly unlikely, the provisions would require the Company to issue 1,167,503 additional shares of Common Stock which would be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nThe share price of our Common Stock is subject to fluctuation, has been and may continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors who have purchased shares of our Common Stock.\nWe expect that the market price of our Common Stock may continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. The market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u25cf failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf changes in operating performance and Common stock market valuations of other technology companies generally;\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf changes in our Board of Directors or management;\n\u25cf sales of large blocks of our Common Stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u25cf potential lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u25cf short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our Common Stock;\n\u25cf general economic conditions in the United States and abroad; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many software companies. Stock prices of many software companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have no history of paying dividends on our Common Stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not previously paid dividends on our Common Stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of blank check preferred stock, and issuances of such preferred stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such preferred stock, may result in immediate dilution to existing stockholders, including investors in this offering.\nIf we raise additional funds through future issuances of preferred stock or debt securities convertible into preferred stock, our stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new preferred stock or debt securities that we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of shares of Common Stock. Although we have no present plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock, in the event that we issue additional shares of our preferred stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such preferred stock after the date of the offering, the investors in this offering will be diluted. We may choose to raise additional capital using such preferred stock or debt securities because of market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities become delisted from Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Common Stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our Common Stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Common Stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our Common Stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our Common Stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of March 30, 2020, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our equity securities, together with their affiliates, beneficially own 72% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders have significant influence to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the ability to control the election of our directors, amend or prevent amendment of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or effect or prevent a change in corporate control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination. In addition, any sale of a significant amount of our Common Stock held by our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Our management\u2019s stock ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our Common Stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing any gains from our Common Stock.\nImplications of Being an \u201cEmerging Growth Company\u201d\nAs a public reporting company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company, we:\n\u25cf are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d);\n\u25cf are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as \u201ccompensation discussion and analysis\u201d);\n\u25cf are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden-parachute\u201d votes);\n\u25cf are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure;\n\u25cf may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) disclosure; and\n\u25cf are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d at pages 42-43 of our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on June 3, 2019 (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d).\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the SEC\u2019s rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding internal control over financial reporting, are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis, are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure, and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Under current SEC rules, however, we will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.", "PERMNO": 16012, "SIC": 1700, "TIC": "PECK"}
