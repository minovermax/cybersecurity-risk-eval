The following are some of the more significant factors that could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by management changes or an inability to attract and retain key management, directors and consultants.\nWe incur a low level of overhead and are run by a small number of executives, who rely on a small group of employees. Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our top management and directors. We also depend on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, members of our senior management or directors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, as our business evolves, we may require additional or different management members, directors or consultants, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate, attract and retain them if and when they are needed.\nBecause our Hong Kong operations account for a majority of our overall business, and most of our Hong Kong business is derived from the sale of products to members in China, any material adverse change in our business relating to either Hong Kong or China would likely have a material adverse impact on our overall business.\nIn 2013 and 2014, approximately 77% and 89% of our revenue, respectively, was generated in Hong Kong. Most of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. This geographic concentration in our business means that events or conditions that could negatively impact this geographic region or our operations in this region would have a greater adverse impact upon our overall business and financial results than would be the case with a company having greater geographic diversification.\nIn contrast to our operations in other parts of the world, we have not implemented a direct sales model in China. The Chinese government permits direct selling only by organizations that have a license that we do not have, and has also adopted anti-multilevel marketing legislation. We operate an e-commerce direct selling model in Hong Kong and recognize the revenue derived from sales to both Hong Kong and Chinese members as being generated in Hong Kong. Products purchased by members in China are delivered to third parties that act as the importers of record under agreements to pay applicable duties. In addition, through a Chinese entity, we sell products in China using an e-commerce retail model. The Chinese entity operates separately from the Hong Kong entity, although a Chinese member may elect to participate separately or in both.\nWe believe that the laws and regulations in China regarding direct selling and multi-level marketing are not specifically applicable to our Hong Kong-based e-commerce activity, and that our Chinese entity is operating in compliance with applicable Chinese laws. However, there can be no assurance that the Chinese authorities will agree with our interpretations of applicable laws and regulations or that China will not adopt new laws or regulations. Should the Chinese government determine that our e-commerce activity violates China\u2019s direct selling or anti-multilevel marketing legislation, or should new laws or regulations be adopted, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the Chinese government\u2019s significant concerns about direct selling activities, it scrutinizes very closely activities of direct selling companies. At times, investigations and related actions by government regulators have resulted in a few cases where we have paid substantial fines. In each of these cases, we have been allowed to recommence operations after the government\u2019s investigation, and no material changes to our business model were required in connection with these fines and impediments.\nAlthough we attempt to work closely with both national and local Chinese governmental agencies in conducting our business, our efforts to comply with national and local laws may be harmed by a rapidly evolving regulatory climate, concerns about activities resembling violations of direct selling or anti-multi-level marketing legislation, subjective interpretations of laws and regulations, and activities by individual distributors that may violate laws notwithstanding our strict policies prohibiting such activities. Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our individual distributors or employee sales representatives, or importers of record are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, extended interruptions of business, restrictions on our future ability to obtain business licenses or expand into new locations, changes to our business model, the termination of required licenses to conduct business, or other actions, any of which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious other factors could harm our business in Hong Kong and China, such as worsening economic conditions in Hong Kong or China, adverse local publicity or other events that may be out of our control. For example, we were advised to voluntarily suspend marketing activities in China during the third quarter of 2007 when the Chinese government was expected to impose a more intense enforcement program against illegal chain sales activities. We did not want to run the risk of being inadvertently entangled in the government enforcement actions and voluntarily withdrew all marketing activities from China during that period. It may be necessary or advisable to repeat this or similar actions from time to time in the future, and such periods of reduced activity could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to maintain and expand our distributor relationships could adversely affect our business.\nWe distribute our products through independent distributors, and we depend upon them directly for all of our sales in most of our markets. Accordingly, our success depends in significant part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate a large base of distributors. Our direct selling organization is headed by a relatively small number of key distributors. The loss of a significant number of distributors, especially key distributors, could materially and adversely affect sales of our products and could impair our ability to attract new distributors. Moreover, the replacement of distributors could be difficult because, in our efforts to attract and retain distributors, we compete with other direct selling organizations, including but not limited to those in the personal care, cosmetic product and nutritional supplement industries. Our distributors may terminate their services with us at any time and, in fact, like most direct selling organizations, we have a high rate of attrition.\nThe number of active distributors or their productivity may not increase and could decline in the future. We cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of distributors because we primarily rely upon existing distributors to sponsor and train new distributors and to motivate new and existing distributors. Operating results could be adversely affected if our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient economic incentive or interest to retain existing distributors and to attract new distributors.\nThe number and productivity of our distributors could be harmed by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nadverse publicity or negative perceptions regarding us, our products, our method of distribution or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nlack of interest in, or the technical failure of, existing or new products;\n\u25cf\nlack of interest in our existing compensation plan for distributors or in enhancements or other changes to that compensation plan;\n\u25cf\nour actions to enforce our policies and procedures;\n\u25cf\nregulatory actions or charges or private actions against us or others in our industry;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in management or the loss of one or more key distributor leaders;\n\u25cf\nentry of new competitors, or new products or compensation plan enhancements by existing competitors, in our markets; and\n\u25cf\npotential saturation or maturity levels in a given country or market which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain distributors in such market.\nThe high level of competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.\nThe business of marketing personal care, cosmetic, nutritional supplements, and lifestyle enhancement products is highly competitive. This market segment includes numerous manufacturers, distributors, marketers, and retailers that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the United States and abroad. The market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. Sales of similar products by competitors may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of distributors from other direct selling organizations, including those that market similar products. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, offer a wider array of products, have far greater financial resources and many more active distributors than we have. Even more numerous are those medium- and small-sized, all privately held Chinese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies that are fierce competitors and are much closer to directly competing with us. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part, on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors with our products, attractive compensation plan and other incentives. We believe that we have an attractive product line and that our compensation and incentive programs provide our distributors with significant earning potential. However, we cannot be sure that our programs for recruitment and retention of distributors would be successful.\nSome of our competitors have employed or otherwise contracted for the services of our former officers, employees, consultants, and distributors, who may try to use information and contacts obtained while under contract with us for competitive advantage. While we seek to protect our information through contractual and other means, there can be no assurance that we will timely learn of such activity, have the resources to attempt to stop it, or have adequate remedies available to us.\nAn increase in the amount of compensation paid to distributors would reduce profitability.\nA significant expense is the payment of compensation to our distributors, which represented approximately 46% of net sales during each of 2013 and 2014. We compensate our distributors by paying commissions, bonuses, and certain awards and prizes. Factors impacting the overall commission payout include the growth and depth of the distributor network, the distributor retention rate, the level of promotions, local promotional programs and business development agreements. Any increase in compensation payments to distributors as a percentage of net sales will reduce our profitability.\nOur compensation plan includes a cap that may be enforced on distributor compensation paid out on a weekly dollar limit or as a percentage of product sales. There can be no assurance that enforcement of this cap will ensure profitability (which depends on many other factors). Moreover, enforcement of this cap could cause key distributors affected by the cap to leave and join other companies.\nFailure of new products to gain distributor and market acceptance could harm our business.\nAn important component of our business is our ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among our distributor force. If we fail to introduce new products on a timely basis, our distributor productivity could be harmed. In addition, if any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements, or have quality problems, this would harm our results of operations. Factors that could affect our ability to continue to introduce new products include, among others, limited capital and human resources, government regulations, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products and any failure to anticipate changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences.\nDirect-selling laws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict our direct sales efforts and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business.\nOur direct selling system is subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid\u201d schemes, which compensate participants for recruiting additional participants irrespective of product sales, use high pressure recruiting methods and/or do not involve legitimate products.\nComplying with these widely varying and sometimes inconsistent rules and regulations can be difficult and may require the devotion of significant resources on our part. There can be no assurance that we or our distributors are in compliance with all of these regulations. Our failure or our distributors\u2019 failure to comply with these regulations or new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could negatively impact our business. If we are unable to continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets because of these laws, our revenue and profitability may decline.\nWe are also subject to the risk that new laws or regulations might be implemented or that current laws or regulations might change, which could require us to change or modify the way we conduct our business in certain markets. This could be particularly detrimental to us if we have to change or modify the way we conduct business in markets that represent a significant percentage of our revenue. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) released a proposed New Business Opportunity Rule in April 2006. As initially drafted, the proposed rule would have required pre-sale disclosures for all business opportunities, which may have included network marketing compensation plans such as ours. However, in November 2011, the FTC issued a final rule that does not apply to multi-level marketing companies that do not represent that they or another designated person will do any of the following: (a) provide locations for the operation of equipment, displays, vending machines or similar devices owned, leased, controlled or paid for by the purchaser of the opportunity; (b) provide outlets, accounts, or customers (including but not limited to internet outlets, accounts, or customers) for the purchaser\u2019s goods or services (advertising and general advice about business development and training is not considered as \u201cproviding locations, outlets, accounts, or customers\u201d); or (c) buy back any or all of the goods or services that the purchaser makes or provides. As we understand the final regulation, the Company does not make any of these representations and therefore is not covered by the final rule, which took effect on March 1, 2012.\nChallenges by third parties to the form of our business model could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our direct selling system. The regulatory requirements concerning direct selling systems do not include \u201cbright line\u201d rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to judicial interpretation. An adverse judicial determination against us with respect to our direct selling system, or in proceedings not involving us directly but which challenge the legality of other direct selling marketing systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is also risk that challenges and settlements involving other parties could provide incentives for similar actions by distributors against us and other direct selling companies. Moreover, challenges to our business system and operations in important markets may come from short sellers, hedge funds and other investors. Other companies in our industry have recently faced such challenges. Any challenges regarding us or others in our industry could harm our business if such challenges result in the investigation of our business model and operations or the imposition of any fines or damages on our business, create adverse publicity, increase scrutiny of our industry, detrimentally affect our efforts to recruit or motivate distributors and attract customers, or interpret laws in a manner inconsistent with our current business practices.\nOur products and related activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could delay, limit or prevent the sale of some of our products in some markets.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, importation, advertising, distribution, sale and storage of certain of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the United States Department of Agriculture and by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed and sold. For example, the FDA requires us and our suppliers to meet relevant current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations for the preparation, packing and storage of foods and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. We are also now required to report serious adverse events associated with consumer use of certain of our products. Other laws and regulations govern or restrict the claims that may be made about our products and the information that must be included and excluded on labels.\nIn markets outside the United States, prior to commencing operations or marketing new products, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from a ministry of health or a comparable agency. Moreover, a foreign jurisdiction may pass laws that would prohibit the use of certain ingredients in their particular market. Compliance with these regulations can create delays and added expense in introducing new products to certain markets.\nFailure by our distributors or us to comply with those regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could materially and adversely affect our business. If we are not able to satisfy the various regulations, then we would have to cease sales of that product in that market. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may adversely affect the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of revenues.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. These potential effects could include, however, requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nNew regulations governing the marketing and sale of nutritional supplements could harm our business.\nThere has been an increasing movement in the United States and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements, which could impose additional restrictions or requirements in the future. In the United States, for example, some legislators and industry critics continue to push for increased regulatory authority by the FDA over nutritional supplements. Our business could be harmed if more restrictive legislation is successfully introduced and adopted in the future. In particular, the adoption of legislation requiring FDA approval of supplements or ingredients could delay or inhibit our ability to introduce new supplements. We face similar pressures in our other markets. In the United States, effective December 1, 2009, the FTC approved revisions to its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (\u201cGuides\u201d) that require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the company they are endorsing and do not allow marketing using atypical results. The requirements and restrictions of the revised Guides may diminish the impact of our marketing efforts and negatively impact our sales results. If we or our distributors fail to comply with these Guides, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and/or forced to alter our operations. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies or require us to reformulate our products.\nRegulations governing the production and marketing of our personal care products could harm our business.\nOur personal care products are subject to various domestic and foreign laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic products and set forth regulations for determining whether a product can be marketed as a \u201ccosmetic\u201d or requires further approval as an over-the-counter drug. A determination that our cosmetic products impact the structure or function of the human body, or improper marketing claims by our distributors, may lead to a determination that such products require pre-market approval as a drug. Such regulations in any given market can limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process for those products. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could face enforcement action against us and we could be fined, forced to alter or stop selling our products and/or required to adjust our operations. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute our personal care products or impose additional burdens or requirements on the contents of our personal care products or require us to reformulate our products.\nIf we are found not to be in compliance with good manufacturing practices our operations could be harmed.\nFDA regulations on good manufacturing practices and adverse event reporting requirements for the nutritional supplement industry are in effect and require good manufacturing processes for us and our vendors, including stringent vendor qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. We are also now required to report serious adverse events associated with consumer use of our products. Our operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities make determinations that we or our vendors are not in compliance with the new regulations. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain of our products. In addition, compliance with these regulations has increased and may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain of our products as we work with our vendors to assure they are qualified and in compliance.\nFailure to comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing product claims and advertising could harm our business.\nOur failure to comply with FTC or state regulations, or with regulations in foreign markets that cover our product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by distributors for which we may be held responsible, may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise materially and adversely affect the distribution and sale of our products. Distributor activities in our existing markets that violate applicable governmental laws or regulations could result in governmental or private actions against us in markets where we operate. Given the size of our distributor force, we cannot ensure that our distributors would comply with applicable legal requirements.\nAlthough our distributors are independent contractors, improper distributor actions that violate laws or regulations could harm our business.\nOur distributors are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight as we would if distributors were our own employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our distributors will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept our introduction of new products, or comply with our distributor policies and procedures. Extensive federal, state and local laws regulate our business, our products and our network marketing program. Because we have expanded into foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our distributors differ due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business. While we have implemented distributor policies and procedures designed to govern distributor conduct and to protect the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names, it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of distributors and their independent status.\nGiven the size and diversity of our distributor force, we experience problems with distributors from time to time, especially with respect to our distributors in foreign markets. Distributors often desire to enter a market, before we have received approval to do business, to gain an advantage in the marketplace. Improper distributor activity in new geographic markets could result in adverse publicity and can be particularly harmful to our ability to ultimately enter these markets. Violations by our distributors of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations, and harm our business reputation. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our distributors. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nAdverse publicity concerning any actual or claimed failure by us or our distributors to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding product claims and advertising, good manufacturing practices, the regulation of our network marketing program, the licensing of our products for sale in our target markets or other aspects of our business, whether or not resulting in enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties, could have an adverse effect on our goodwill and could negatively affect our ability to attract, motivate and retain distributors, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. We cannot ensure that all distributors will comply with applicable legal requirements relating to the advertising, labeling, licensing or distribution of our products.\nIn addition, our distributors\u2019 and consumers\u2019 perception of the safety and quality of our products and ingredients, as well as similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies, can be significantly influenced by national media attention, publicized scientific research or findings, widespread product liability claims and other publicity concerning our products or ingredients or similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies. Adverse publicity, whether or not accurate or resulting from consumers\u2019 use or misuse of our products, that associates consumption of our products or ingredients or any similar products or ingredients with illness or other adverse effects, questions the benefits of our or similar products or claims that any such products are ineffective, inappropriately labeled or have inaccurate instructions as to their use, could negatively impact our reputation or the market demand for our products.\nWe have a limited product line.\nWe offer a limited number of products under our NHT Global brand. Our Premium Noni Juice\u2122 product accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue. If demand decreases significantly, government regulation restricts its sale, we are unable to adequately source or deliver the product, or we cease offering the product for any reason without a suitable replacement, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of independent third parties to manufacture and supply our products.\nAll of our products are manufactured by a limited number of independent third parties. There is no assurance that our current manufacturers will continue to reliably supply products to us at the level of quality we require. If a key manufacturer suffers liquidity or experiences operational problems assisting with our products, our results could suffer. In the event any of our third-party manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes and quality levels at acceptable prices, we will be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement manufacturing sources or replacement products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative manufacturing sources or products or be able to do so on a timely basis. An extended interruption in the supply of certain of our products may result in a substantial loss of revenue. In addition, any actual or perceived degradation of product quality as a result of our reliance on third party manufacturers may have an adverse effect on revenue or result in increased product returns.\nGrowth may be impeded by the political and economic risks of entering and operating foreign markets.\nOur ability to achieve future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to grow in our existing international markets, enter new international markets on a timely basis, or that new markets would be profitable. We must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any foreign market.\nAlso, it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques would be accepted or successful in any given country. In addition to significant regulatory barriers, we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those elsewhere. We may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country. Once we have entered a market, we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market. No assurance can be given that we would be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals.\nIn many markets, other direct selling companies already have significant market penetration, the effect of which could be to desensitize the local distributor population to a new opportunity or to make it more difficult for us to recruit qualified distributors. There can be no assurance that, even if we are able to commence operations in foreign countries, there would be a sufficiently large population of potential distributors inclined to participate in a direct selling system offered by us. We believe our future success could depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our business methods, including distributor compensation plan, across all markets in which our products are sold. There can be no assurance that we would be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could lower our revenue and net income.\nIn 2014, approximately 98% of our revenue was recorded by subsidiaries located outside of North America. Revenue transactions and related commission payments, as well as other incurred expenses, are typically denominated in the local currency. Accordingly, our international subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. The results of operations of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during consolidation since we translate into U.S. dollars using the average exchanges rates for the period. As exchange rates vary, revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations. Additionally, we may record significant gains or losses related to foreign-denominated cash and cash equivalents and the re-measurement of inter-company balances.\nWe believe that our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is somewhat limited since the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. We also purchase a significant majority of inventories in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposure, mainly to South Korean won, Taiwan dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, Russian ruble, Kazakhstani tenge, Ukrainian hryrnia and European euro, represented approximately 18% and 9% of our revenue in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposure may increase in the near future as we intend to develop opportunities in Southeast Asia, Canada and Europe. Additionally, our foreign currency exchange rate exposure would significantly increase if the Hong Kong dollar were no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar.\nGiven our inability to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot estimate the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results, product pricing or our overall financial condition. Further, to date we have not attempted to reduce our exposure to short-term exchange rate fluctuations by using foreign currency exchange contracts.\nChanges in tax or duty laws, and unanticipated tax or duty liabilities, could adversely affect our net income.\nIn the course of doing business we may be subject to various taxes, such as sales and use, value-added, and franchise. We are also subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign jurisdictions. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. Economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows.\nOur principal domicile is the United States. Under tax treaties, we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the United States for taxes paid abroad. Taxes paid to foreign taxing authorities may exceed the credits available to us, resulting in the payment of a higher overall effective tax rate on our worldwide operations.\nOur effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nWe may also be subject to examinations of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes, which is subject to significant discretion. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S., or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial results or operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products. The failure to properly calculate, report and pay such duties when we are subject to them could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any change in the laws or regulations regarding such duties, or any interpretation thereof, could result in an increase in the cost of doing business.\nTransfer pricing regulations affect our business and results of operations.\nIn many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our United States or local entities and are taxed accordingly. We have adopted transfer pricing agreements with our subsidiaries to regulate inter-company transfers, which agreements are subject to transfer pricing laws that regulate the flow of funds between the subsidiaries and the parent corporation for product purchases, management services, and contractual obligations, such as the payment of distributor compensation. We believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing laws, and we intend to continue to operate in compliance with such laws. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing laws, or that those laws would not be modified, which, as a result, may require changes in our operating procedures or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our financial results or operations.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our distributors, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur distributors are subject to taxation, and in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate records. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors.\nWe may face litigation that could harm our business.\nWe have been a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in the past. Prosecuting and defending potential litigation and other governmental proceedings may require significant expense and attention of our management. There can be no assurance that the significant money, time and effort spent will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to protect or use our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection of our confidential information and trademarks. Moreover, the laws of some countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property rights. The unauthorized copying, use or other misappropriation of our confidential information, trademarks and other intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from such property without paying us for it. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, expensive and result in inadequate remedies. It is also possible that our use of our intellectual property rights could be found to infringe on prior rights of others and, in that event, we could be compelled to stop or modify the infringing use, which could be burdensome and expensive.\nWe do not have product liability insurance and product liability claims could hurt our business.\nCurrently, we do not have product liability insurance, although the insurance carried by our suppliers may cover certain product liability claims against us. As a marketer of dietary supplements, cosmetics and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies, we may become subjected to various product liability claims, including that:\n\u25cf\nour products contain contaminants or unsafe ingredients;\n\u25cf\nour products include inadequate instructions as to their uses; or\n\u25cf\nour products include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances.\nIf our suppliers\u2019 product liability insurance fails to cover product liability claims or other product liability claims, or any product liability claims exceeds the amount of coverage provided by such policies or if we are unsuccessful in any third party claim against the manufacturer or if we are unsuccessful in collecting any judgment that may be recovered by us against the manufacturer, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may become required to pay high premiums and accept high deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future. Especially since we do not have direct product liability insurance, it is possible that product liability claims and the resulting adverse publicity could negatively affect our business.\nOur internal controls and accounting methods may require modification.\nWe continue to review and develop controls and procedures sufficient to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis. If we do not develop and implement effective controls and procedures, we may not be able to report our financial performance on a timely basis and our business and stock price would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Among other things, we must perform systems and processes evaluation and testing. We must also conduct an assessment of our internal controls to allow management to report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are required to provide management\u2019s assessment of internal controls in conjunction with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed under Item 9A of this report, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2014. In the future, our continued assessment, or the assessment by our independent registered public accounting firm, could reveal significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which may need to be disclosed in future Annual Reports on Form 10-K. We believe, at the current time, that we are taking appropriate steps to mitigate these risks. However, disclosures of this type can cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the price of our common stock. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. Deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting may negatively impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems.\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of information processing systems and management information technology. Our information technology systems are designed and selected to facilitate order entry and customer billing, maintain distributor records, accurately track purchases and distributor compensation payments, manage accounting operations, generate reports, and provide customer service and technical support. Any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough we believe that the members of our software development team have the qualifications, know-how and experience to perform the necessary software development and other information technology services, there can be no assurance that there will not be delays or interruptions in these services. An interruption or delay in availability of these services could, if it lasted long enough, prevent us from accepting orders, cause distributors to leave our business, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.\nSystem failures and attacks could harm our business.\nBecause of our diverse geographic operations and our internationally applicable distributor compensation plans, our business is highly dependent on the efficient functioning of our information technology systems and operations, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and worms, hacking, denial of service attacks, software defects and other events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as human error. Despite precautions implemented by our information technology staff, problems could result in interruptions in services and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, hackers could attack our system seeking to retrieve personal or confidential information of ours or of third parties, such as credit card information used to purchase our products on-line. Although we take steps to prevent such loss of information, there can be no assurance that our system will not be successfully hacked. Laws in the United States and other jurisdictions where we do business require prompt notice of any such loss of information. Failure to comply with those reporting obligations could result in material penalties. In addition, if our system were hacked, we could incur material costs in investigating the incidents and could be liable for damages. Any such damages may or may not be covered by insurance.\nTerrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, acts of war, epidemics or other communicable diseases or any other natural disasters may seriously harm our business.\nTerrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, or acts of war or natural disasters may cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, our facilities and our distributors and customers, which could impact our revenues, expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war or hostility, such as the Chinese objection to the Taiwan independence movement and its resultant tension in the Taiwan Strait, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. Additionally, natural disasters less severe than the Indian Ocean tsunami that occurred in December 2004 may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our systems, software and data reside on third-party servers, our access could be temporarily or permanently interrupted.\nBeginning in 2012, most of our systems, software and data reside in the \u201ccloud\u201d on third-party servers to which we have contractual access. Cyber-attacks or hacking on these servers unrelated to us, or system or hardware failures experienced by the third party vendor, could result in disclosure of or damage to our systems, software and data. Moreover, any delay or failure in payment of the third party vendors, disputes with such vendors, or business interruption or failure of the third party vendors could result in loss of or interruption in access to our systems, software or data. It is possible that our systems, software and data could in the future be moved to servers of different third parties or to our own servers. Any such move could result in temporary or permanent loss of access to our systems, software or data. Any protracted loss of such access would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience substantial negative cash flows, which may have a significant adverse effect on our business and could threaten our solvency.\nWe experienced substantial negative cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, primarily due to declines in our revenues greater than the decreases in expenditures we could manage. If we again experience negative cash flows, any resulting decreasing cash balance could impair our ability to support our operations and, eventually, threaten our solvency, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our stock price. Negative cash flows and the related adverse market perception associated therewith may have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, our ability to attract new distributors and/or sell our products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining an adequate level of cash resources and we could be forced to act more aggressively in the area of expense reduction in order to conserve cash resources as we look for alternative solutions.\nIf we experience negative cash flows, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If available, it could have a highly dilutive effect on the holdings of existing stockholders.\nUnless we are able to at least maintain revenues, control expenses and achieve positive cash flows, our ability to support our obligations could be impaired and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our solvency and our ability to repay our debts when they come due could be threatened. We may need to seek additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms in order to improve our liquidity. However, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, and any new financing could have a dilutive effect to our existing stockholders.\nDisappointing quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. If our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially.\nOur common stock is particularly subject to volatility because of the industry in which we operate.\nThe market prices of securities of direct selling companies have been extremely volatile, and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe historic price of our common stock has been volatile and the future market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. Further, the limited trading volume in our common stock has, and in the future may, contribute significantly to the high volatility in the market price of our common stock. This may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to sell shares when they want and at prices they find attractive.\nThe public market for our common stock has historically been very volatile. Prior to February 17, 2015, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Market and, like many other stocks quoted on the OTCQB, trading in our common stock was often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices. Although we are hopeful that the transition to trading our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market will reduce the historical volatility in our common stock, it is likely that our common stock will continue to experience volatility for some time. There are a number of factors that may contribute to this volatility, but the limited trading volume in our common stock has, and in the future may, contribute significantly to volatility. This volatility may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to sell shares when they want and at prices they find attractive. There can be no assurance that a larger or more liquid market will be developed or maintained for our common stock.\nFuture sales by us or our existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf we or our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Further, even the perception in the public market that we or our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 81728, "SIC": 5122, "TIC": "NHTC"}
