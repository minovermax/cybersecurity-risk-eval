RISK FACTORS.\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in our common shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, many of the following risk factors could be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur losses and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. At September 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $26.50 million. We have historically financed operations primarily through issuances of common shares, the exercise of common share purchase warrants, convertible preferred shares, convertible loans, government grants and tax incentives. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials, and have not completed the development of any of our drug candidates.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of, and seek marketing approvals for our product candidates, prepare for and begin the commercialization of any approved products, and add infrastructure and personnel to support our product development efforts and operations as a public company in the United States and Canada. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nBased on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we or a current or potential future licensee obtains marketing approval for, and commercializes, one or more of our product candidates, which may require several years. Neither we nor a licensee may ever succeed in obtaining marketing approval for, or commercializing our product candidates and, even if marketing approval is obtained, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to finance our operations through regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in the future, particularly if we advance any drug candidates beyond Phase 2 clinical development or expand the number of drug candidates in clinical studies. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates that are not then subject to licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements with third parties, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe depend heavily on the success of our drug product candidates. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize one or more of these experimental treatments, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which may not occur for multiple years, if at all, will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of our drug product candidates. The success of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional capital from potential future licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements or from any future offering of our debt or equity securities;\n\u00b7\nour ability to identify and enter into potential future licenses or other collaboration arrangements with third parties and the terms of the arrangements;\n\u00b7\nour timing to obtain applicable regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of clinical development;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to provide acceptable evidence demonstrating a product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of raw materials to produce our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers or establishing commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\n\u00b7\nestablishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7\ngenerating commercial sales of the product candidate, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of the product candidate, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\neffectively competing with other therapies; and\n\u00b7\nmaintaining an acceptable safety profile of the product candidate following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, which would materially harm our business. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we may never be able to generate revenues through the license or sale of any of our product candidates.\nPublic health threats could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nPublic health threats, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses could adversely impact our operations and disrupt our ongoing or planned research and development activities. At present, the COVID-19 pandemic, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate this pandemic, are causing disruptions to almost every industry directly or indirectly. Governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions and shelter in place orders, resulting in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, cancellation of events and other measures. These measures may disrupt normal business operations and may have significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.\nWe continue to monitor our operations and applicable government recommendations, and we have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including limiting travel, working from home and implementing new procedures in the workplace. The risk of cyber-attacks or other data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our remote or hybrid working environment, which may be less secure and more susceptible to security breaches. Operating requirements may continually change due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we may experience unpredictability in our expenses. Since we rely on third-party CMOs to manufacture our drug candidates we may be more susceptible to supply chain disruptions than companies with in-house manufacturing. While we have not experienced significant shortages of raw materials to date, as a result of the pandemic and increased demand for production, CMOs have generally reported that supplies of raw materials and critical components necessary for our manufacturing processes have been more challenging and expensive to obtain, and longer lead times may be required for scheduling future production runs. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential future business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur primarily operating entity, Edesa Biotech Research, Inc., was formed in July 2015. To date, our operations have been limited to organization and staffing, developing and securing our technology, entering into licensing arrangements, raising capital and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete development of any product candidate, obtain marketing approval, manufacture a commercial-scale product, or arrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Assuming we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and may not be successful in such a transition. Any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nWe expect to expand our capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, finance and administration and, potentially, sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates that later could prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify and acquire or in-license additional product candidates.\nPart of our strategy involves diversifying our product development risk by identifying and acquiring or in-licensing novel product candidates. We may fail to identify and acquire or in-license promising product candidates. The competition to acquire or in-license promising product candidates is fierce, especially from large multinational companies that have greater resources and experience than we have. If we are unable to identify and acquire or in- license suitable product candidates, we will be unable to diversify our product risk. We believe that any such failure could have a significant negative impact on our prospects because the risk of failure of any particular development program in the pharmaceutical field is high.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Dr. Pardeep Nijhawan, our Chief Executive Officer and Secretary; and Michael Brooks, our President; as well as other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Although we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with the company at any time. The unplanned loss of the services of any of these persons could materially impact the achievement of our research, development, financial and commercialization objectives. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for similar personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may have commitments with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations outside of the United States. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a significant effect on our operating results when our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the government of the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and collaborators, including intentional failures to comply with FDA or Office of Inspector General regulations or similar regulations of comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage, including damage from cyber attacks, ransomware attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, human error and technological errors, natural disasters and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, Health Canada (HC) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization our product candidates.\nIn connection with obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any drug candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. In particular, the small number of subjects and patients in early clinical trials of our product candidates may make the results of these clinical trials less predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether our results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. There is no assurance that we will be able to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. Pre-clinical studies or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, or to discontinue clinical trials altogether. Ultimately, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates.\nInterim results, top-line, initial data may not accurately reflect the complete results of a particular study or trial.\nWe may publicly disclose interim, top-line or initial data from time to time that is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy and safety data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimates, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully evaluate all data. Interim, top-line and initial data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, the information we may publicly disclose regarding a particular preclinical or clinical study is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business. If the interim, top-line or initial data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed or delayed, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nIf clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged or delayed, we may incur additional costs, and may not be able to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis or at all.\nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials. A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:\n\u00b7\nconditions imposed by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards, or IRBs, or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ninsufficient supply or deficient quality of product candidates supply or materials to produce our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining regulatory agreement for the conduct of the clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nlower than anticipated enrollment and retention rate of subjects in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including size of patient population, nature of trial protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications;\n\u00b7\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure of third-party contractors to meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\npre-clinical or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may require us or any potential future collaborators to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical testing or to abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\n\u00b7\neven if pre-clinical or clinical trial results are positive, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could nonetheless require unanticipated additional clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndelays in establishing the appropriate dosage levels;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates may not have the desired effects; and\n\u00b7\nthe lack of adequate funding to continue clinical trials.\nAdditionally, changes in standard of care or regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Such amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the cost, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Such changes may also require us to reassess the viability of the program in question.\nWe do not know whether our clinical trials will begin or continue as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates. In addition, if we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate, any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be affected and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Furthermore, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nThe clinical trial designs, endpoints and outcomes that will be required to obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates are uncertain. We may never receive marketing approval for our drug candidates.\nTo our knowledge, there are currently no FDA-approved drug treatment options specifically approved for many of the disease indications we are targeting with our drug candidates. Accordingly, there may not be well-established development paths and outcomes. The FDA, Health Canada or any other regulatory authority may determine that the designs or endpoints of any trial that we conduct, or that the outcome shown on any particular endpoint in any trial that we conduct, are not sufficient to establish a clinically meaningful benefit for our drug candidates, or otherwise, to support approval, even if the primary endpoint(s) of the trial is met with statistical significance. If this occurs, our business could be materially harmed. Moreover, if the regulatory authorities require us to conduct additional clinical trials beyond the ones that we currently contemplate, our finances and results from operations will be adversely impacted. If our clinical studies meet their respective primary endpoints, we plan to seek marketing approval. We cannot predict whether each of these regulatory agencies will agree that our study data and information will be sufficient to meet the requirements for filing a marketing application or the standards for approval. If the regulatory agencies determine that more data and information are needed, it could delay and/or negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell a particular product candidate.\nIf the commercial opportunity in chronic ACD or COVID-19-induced ARDS is smaller than we anticipate, our future revenue from EB01 or EB05, as applicable, will be adversely affected and our business will suffer.\nIt is critical to our ability to grow and become profitable that we successfully identify patients with chronic ACD or COVID-19-induced ARDS. Our estimates of the number of people who have these conditions as well as the subset who have the potential to benefit from treatment with EB01 or EB05, are based on a variety of sources, including third-party estimates and analyses in the scientific literature, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new information may emerge that changes our estimate of the prevalence of these diseases or the number of patient candidates for these drug candidates. The effort to identify patients for our other potential target indications is at an early stage, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our drug candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our drug candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or access. If the commercial opportunity for these conditions is smaller than we anticipate, our future financial performance may be adversely impacted.\nWhile we have chosen to test our product candidates in specific clinical indications based in part on our understanding of their mechanisms of action, our understanding may be incorrect or incomplete and, therefore, our product candidates may not be effective against the diseases tested in our clinical trials.\nOur rationale for selecting the particular therapeutic indications for each of our product candidates is based in part on our understanding of the mechanism of action of these product candidates. However, our understanding of the product candidates\u2019 mechanism of action may be incomplete or incorrect, or the mechanism may not be clinically relevant to the diseases treated. In such cases, our product candidates may prove to be ineffective in the clinical trials for treating those diseases, and adverse clinical trial results would likely negatively impact our business and results from operations.\nA successful sPLA2 or anti-TLR4 drug has not been developed to date and we can provide no assurances that we will be successful or that there will be no adverse side effects.\nOur sPLA2 and anti-TLR4 product candidates employ novel mechanisms of action. To our knowledge no drug companies have successfully commercialized an sPLA2 inhibitor or an anti-TLR4 antibody and as a result the efficacy and long-term side effects are not known. There is no guarantee that we will successfully develop and/or commercialize an sPLA2 inhibitor or anti-TLR4 therapy, and/or that our product candidates will have no adverse side effects.\nEven if one of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any product candidate receives marketing approval, the approved product may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If an approved product does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations. Our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, Canada, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of any of our future product candidates that receive marketing approval.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and any of our other current or future product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing the applicable product candidate if it receives marketing approval.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience as a company in the sale or marketing of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us could be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products to treat our target indications or markets before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Competitors may also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do. Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, have fewer or less severe side effects, are approved for broader indications or patient populations, or are more convenient or less expensive than any products that we develop and commercializes. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. If approved, our product candidates will compete for a share of the existing market with numerous other products being used to treat ACD, ARDS, or any other indications for which we may receive government approval.\nEven if we are able to commercialize one of our product candidates, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted and, in some markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize EB01, EB05 or any other product candidate successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. The amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when and if we begin conducting more expansive clinical development of our product candidates, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nWe will be dependent on third parties for manufacturing, including optimization, technology transfers and scaling up of clinical scale quantities of all of our product candidates.\nWe have no direct experience in manufacturing any of our product candidates, and currently lack the resources or capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. As a result, we will be dependent on third parties for manufacturing, including optimization, technology transfers and scaling up of clinical scale quantities of all our product candidates. We believe that this strategy will enable us to direct operational and financial resources to the development of our product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing manufacturing infrastructure; however our use of third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term clinical or commercial supply of any of our product candidates and may in the future be unable to scale-up and/or conclude agreements for commercial supply with commercial third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, they may encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, laboratory testing, quality control or quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, any of which could result in our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet clinical timelines for a particular product candidate, to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate or to commercialize the product candidate. We may compete with other companies for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nIf the third parties that we contract to manufacture product for our preclinical tests and clinical trials cease to continue to do so for any reason or if we elect to change suppliers, we likely would experience delays in advancing these clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement suppliers on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nThe manufacturing of our monoclonal antibody candidates is complex and subject to a multitude of risks. These manufacturing risks could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of these drug candidates for clinical development, and commercialization.\nThe manufacture of our monoclonal antibody candidates requires processing steps that are more complex than those required for most small molecule drugs. As a result of the complexities in manufacturing biologics, the cost to manufacture biologics in general, and our cell product candidates in particular, is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing processes are less reliable and are more difficult to reproduce. Although we are working with third parties to develop reproducible and commercially viable manufacturing processes for our product candidates, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency, and timely availability of reagents or raw materials.\nWe may make changes as we continue to evolve the manufacturing processes for our product candidates for advanced clinical trials and commercialization, and we cannot be sure that even minor changes in these processes will not cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of our ongoing clinical trials, future clinical trials, or the performance of the product once commercialized. In some circumstances, changes in manufacturing operations, including to our protocols, processes, materials or facilities used, may require us to perform additional preclinical or comparability studies, or to collect additional clinical data from patients prior to undertaking additional clinical studies or filing for regulatory approval for a product candidate. These requirements may lead to delays in our clinical development and commercialization plans for our product candidates, and may increase our development costs substantially.\nWe may also decide to transfer certain manufacturing process know-how and certain intermediates to other contract manufacturing organizations. Transferring manufacturing testing and processes and know-how is complex and involves review and incorporation of both documented and undocumented processes that may have evolved over time. We and any CMOs or third parties that we engage for manufacturing our product candidates will need to conduct significant development work to transfer these processes and manufacture each of our product candidates for clinical trials and commercialization. In addition, we may be required to demonstrate the comparability of material generated by any CMO or third parties that we engage for manufacturing our product candidates with material previously produced and used in testing. The inability to manufacture comparable drug product by us or our CMO could delay the continued development of our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such clinical trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, drug distributers and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials complies with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, and is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document and we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we would likely need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required marketing approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, Health Canada and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market EB01, EB05 or any other Edesa product candidate from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction.\nWe have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for product candidates and expect to rely on third-party consultants to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that EB01, EB05 or any of our other product candidates is not effective, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or that prevent or limit commercial use.\nRegulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical studies, clinical trials or other trials. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, and compliance with such requirements may involve substantial resources, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nEven if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, an approved product and our manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation, including the possible requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or to conduct costly post- marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. In addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to ensure that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and documentation. Accordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not qualify for or ultimately benefit from various expedited regulatory review programs or designations.\nIn the event that our Phase 2/3 study of EB05 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is successful, we intend to apply for various regulatory incentives in the United States, such as breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, accelerated approval and priority review, where available, that provide for expedited review and/or other benefits, and we may also seek similar designations elsewhere in the world. Often, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in determining whether or not product candidates qualify for such regulatory incentives and benefits and we cannot guarantee we would be successful in obtaining beneficial regulatory designations by FDA or other regulatory agencies. Even if approved, expedited designations may not result in faster development processes, reviews or approvals compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may later decide that any of our development programs no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. If we are not able to obtain or maintain such designations for EB05 or other product candidates, it could delay and/or negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval.\nThe FDA has broad discretion regarding Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19 medical products, and such authorizations are only valid during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\nWhile, in most cases, a therapeutic must be approved by FDA before the product may be sold, when a public health emergency is declared, subject to certain conditions, FDA may authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). In the event that our Phase 2/3 clinical study of EB05 is successful, and if we believe we meet eligibility requirements, we intend to submit an application with the FDA for EUA. FDA does not have review deadlines with respect to such submissions and, therefore, the timing of any potential approval of an EUA submission would be uncertain. We would not be able to guarantee that the FDA would review our data in a timely manner, or that the FDA would accept the data when reviewed. The FDA may decide that our data are insufficient for an EUA and require additional studies and refuse to approve our application. In addition, even if granted, the FDA may revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining an EUA, or if any granted EUA is revoked after a short period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and professionals, and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable federal anti-kickback, federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Violation of certain of these laws could also result in exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare programs. Exclusion, suspension or debarment would significantly impact our ability to commercialize, sell or distribute any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval.\nUse of social media platforms presents new risks.\nWe believe that our potential patient population is active on social media. Social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a product candidate, which could result in reporting obligations. In addition, there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us or our product candidates on any social networking website. In addition, our employees or third parties with whom we contract, such as our CROs or CMOs, may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in a manner that may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property or result in public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers and others or information regarding our product candidates or clinical trials. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition and could adversely affect the price of our common shares.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are dependent on license relationships with third parties for our key drug development programs.\nIn 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to obtain exclusive rights to certain know-how, patents and data relating to a pharmaceutical product. We are using the exclusive rights to develop the product for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic uses in topical dermal applications and anorectal applications, including for the development of EB01 to treat ACD and EB02 to treat HD. In 2021, we also entered into a license agreement with the inventor of the same pharmaceutical product to acquire global rights for all fields of use beyond those named under the 2016 license agreement with Yissum. If we default or fail to perform any of the terms, covenants, provisions or our obligations under the License Agreement, Yissum has the option to terminate the License Agreement, subject to advance notice to cure such default. Any termination of this license agreement would have a materially adverse impact on our business and results from operations.\nIn April 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with NovImmune SA to obtain exclusive rights throughout the world to certain know- how, patents and data relating to the monoclonal antibodies targeting TLR4 and CXCL10. We are using these rights to develop EB05 as a potential treatment for ARDS resulting from COVID-19. If we default or fail to perform any of the terms, covenants, provisions or our obligations under the License Agreement, NovImmune has the option to terminate the License Agreement, subject to advance notice to cure such default. Any termination of this license agreement would have a materially adverse impact on our business and results from operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our licensed technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our licensed technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success will partially depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We intend to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States, in Europe and in certain additional jurisdictions related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering the licensed technology or product candidates.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of any patents issued to us will likely be highly uncertain. Patent applications that we file may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may also diminish the value of patents issued to us, narrow the scope of our patent protection or make enforcement more difficult or uncertain.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other enforcement proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and potentially unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming to prosecute. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or that our patent and other intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable, including for antitrust reasons. As a result, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court or administrative body may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly and so refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the competitor technology in question. Even if we are successful in a patent infringement action, the unsuccessful party may subsequently raise antitrust issues and bring a follow-on action thereon. Antitrust issues may also provide a bar to settlement or constrain the permissible settlement terms.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. The risks of being involved in such litigation and office proceedings may also increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as our business gains greater visibility operating as a publicly traded company in the United States. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights and to restrict our freedom to operate. Third parties may also seek injunctive relief against us, whereby they would attempt to prevent us from practicing our technologies altogether pending outcome of any litigation against us. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates prior to their assertion against us.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial monetary damages. A finding of infringement could also prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, lose market exclusivity, require substantial license payments, or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and likely would distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments that could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our securities. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, costs and lost management time, as well as uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe partially rely on trade secrets and know-how, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary and confidential information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary or confidential information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, particularly unpatented know-how, were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Securities\nThe price of our common shares may continue to be volatile.\nMarket prices for securities of early stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile, and the market price of our common shares has been subject to significant fluctuations. This volatility can be exacerbated by low trading volume. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our shares to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common shares;\n\u00b7\nannouncements about us or our competitors, including funding announcements, corporate or business updates, updates on manufacturing of our products, clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning our product manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and other developments relating to our licensed patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulation and legislation;\n\u00b7\nchange in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any future collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7\nour ability to raise additional capital to carry through with our development plans and current and future operations;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of achievement of, or failure to achieve, our manufacturing, pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as the commencement of clinical development, the completion of a clinical trial or the receipt of regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nuncontemplated problems in the supply of the raw materials used to produce our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nintroductions or announcements of technological innovations or new products candidates by us, our potential future collaborators, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions for equity investments in general, or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries in particular;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop regarding our common shares;\n\u00b7\nregional or worldwide recession;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common shares by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u00b7\nthe loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common shares. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted class action securities litigation. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common shares, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common shares and the market price of our common shares could decrease.\nOur common shares are listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. To maintain our listing, we must meet minimum financial, operating and other requirements, including requirements for a minimum amount of capital, a minimum price per share, and active operations. If we are unable to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common shares. If our common shares are delisted for any reason, it could reduce the value of our common shares and their liquidity. Delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations, or to use our common shares in acquisitions. Delisting may also result in the loss of confidence by suppliers, investors and employees.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our investors, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, grants and debt financings. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that the we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of our common shares. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends or other distributions. If we raise additional funds through licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research and development programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our share price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are currently exempt from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b). If we lose this eligibility, we will incur increased personnel and audit fees in connection with the additional audit requirements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. If we cannot in the future favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our share price.\nThe ownership of our common shares is highly concentrated, which may prevent you and other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause our common shares price to decline.\nThe ownership of our common shares is highly concentrated among insiders and affiliates. Accordingly, these shareholders will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the company\u2019s assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These shareholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of the company, even if such a change of control would benefit the other shareholders of the company. The significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nWe may be deemed a passive foreign investment company, and as a result, U.S. shareholders may be subject to special taxation rules that restrict capital gains treatment, unless the shareholders make a timely tax election to treat the company as a qualified electing fund.\nA special set of U.S. federal income tax rules applies to a foreign corporation that is deemed a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based on our audited financial statements, income tax returns, and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe that we likely will not be classified as a PFIC in the September 30, 2021 taxable year. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not be considered to be a PFIC for any particular year in the future because PFIC status is factual in nature, depends upon factors not wholly within our control, generally cannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question, and is determined annually. If we are deemed to be a PFIC during the current or any future taxable year, U.S. shareholders would be subject to special taxation rules related to gain on sale or disposition of our shares and excess distributions unless they make a timely election to treat our shares as a qualified electing fund (QEF election). A QEF election cannot be made unless we provide U.S. shareholders the information and computations needed to report income and gains pursuant to a QEF election. Without a QEF election, U.S. shareholders may not be able to use capital gains tax treatment and may be subject to potentially adverse tax consequences. Given the complexities of the PFIC and QEF election rules, U.S. shareholders may need to incur the time and expense of consulting a tax adviser about these rules.", "PERMNO": 15854, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EDSA"}
