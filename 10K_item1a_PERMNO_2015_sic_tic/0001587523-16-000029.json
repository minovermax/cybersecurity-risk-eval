Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will be achieved or accomplished. Many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include those matters described under the sections entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which it is made and Knowles does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. All forward looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and attributable to Knowles are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we may make or persons acting on our behalf may issue. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statement for any reason.\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a limited number of OEM customers. If revenues derived from these customers decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur MCE segment derives a significant portion of revenues from a small number of OEM customers which incorporate our acoustic components and audio solutions into mobile handsets, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. The mobile handset industry is experiencing and may continue to experience an increasing concentration of market share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. The industry is also subject to intense competition that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and those of our OEM customers. Further, many of our top customers employ a dual sourcing strategy which requires them to allocate their purchases of specified products to multiple suppliers. In such cases our share of those customers demand for certain products may fluctuate periodically depending on several factors including end customer demand, pricing and supplier performance. Moreover, we generally operate without binding purchase commitments from our major customers and any cancellation, delay or rescheduling of orders by those customers may adversely affect our operating results. For 2015, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 58% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Apple, Inc. accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenue. The loss of any one of our top customers or a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers would reduce our revenues and may impair our ability to achieve or sustain expected operating results, and any delay of a significant volume of purchases by any one of our\ntop customers, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Further, concentration of market share among a few companies and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers\u2019 new or next generation product introductions, over which we have little or no control, and the timing of such introductions may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Accordingly, if current market and industry dynamics continue, our MCE segment\u2019s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by the timing, volumes and pricing of future purchases by a limited number of our OEM customers.\nWe substantially depend on the mobile handset market for a substantial portion of our revenues and any downturn or slower than expected growth in those markets could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely impact our operating results.\nOur MCE segment accounted for 61.0% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the mobile handset market accounted for approximately 50.0% of our consolidated revenues. We expect that a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues will continue to be attributable to the mobile handset market which is cyclical and characterized by continuous and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product supply and demand. Moreover, the mobile handset market may not continue to grow at the rate experienced in recent years or may decline for reasons outside of our control including competition among market participants, market saturation and global economic conditions. The mobile handset market has experienced and may experience periodic downturns which may be characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Because the strength of the mobile handset market is the primary driver of revenues for our MCE segment, any future downturn in the mobile handset market could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, a decline in global economic conditions, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of mobile handset users, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products or technologies, the products and services of our customers or licensees, particularly OEM handset manufacturers, the solvency of key suppliers, failures by counterparties, and negative effects on mobile handset inventories. In addition, our customers\u2019 ability to purchase or pay for our products and services and their customers\u2019 ability to upgrade their mobile handsets could be adversely affected by economic conditions, leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products or services.\nWe derive the majority of our MCE revenues from MEMs microphones sold to the mobile handset market and a significant reduction in our sales of MEMS microphones will significantly reduce our revenues and adversely impact our operating results.\nWithin our MCE segment, revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our MEMS microphones. Sales of MEMS microphones accounted for approximately 37.0% of our total revenue for fiscal 2015 and, if we are successful in divesting our MCE Speaker/Receiver product line, then essentially all of our MCE revenues and profits will be derived from sales of MEMS microphones. We expect that a substantial portion of our revenue will continue to be attributable to sales of MEMS microphones and any weakening of demand, loss of market share or other factor adversely affecting our levels and the timing of our sales of MEMs microphones, including our customers\u2019 product release cycles, market acceptance, product competition, the performance and reliability of our MEMS microphones, and economic and market conditions could cause our MCE revenues to substantially decline, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If the Company is unable to develop new products and compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe compete in highly competitive, technology-based, industries that are highly dynamic as new technologies are developed and introduced. Our competitors may introduce products that are more technologically advanced than our products or launch new products faster that we can. If our businesses are unable to anticipate or match our competitors\u2019 development or launch of new products, identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully launch or ramp production of new products, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe operate in the highly competitive mobile handset industry which requires us to invest significant capital in developing, qualifying and ramping production of new products without any assurance of product sales which could negatively impact our operating results and profits.\nA significant portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from acoustic components and audio solutions, including software, that are required to go through extensive customer qualification processes before being selected by customers for inclusion in their end products. In order to meet the product launch schedules of our top customers, we may invest capital and devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and programming efforts, based on forecasts provided by these customers, without any assurance that our products will be designed into a customer\u2019s product or qualified by the customer. In such cases, if our product is not designed into or qualified by the customer, we may not recover or realize any return on the capital that we invested and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the time required and costs incurred by us to ramp-up production for new products can be significant. Certain non-recurring costs and expenditures for tooling and other equipment may not be reusable in manufacturing products for other customers or different products for the same customer. Product ramps typically involve greater volumes of scrap and risks to execution such as higher costs due to inefficiencies and delays in production, all of which can adversely impact our operating results.\nWe rely on suppliers of a variety of highly engineered or specialized components, sub-assemblies and other inputs, some of whom are sole sourced or use proprietary processes in their operations which, in the event of a business or supply disruption at or by any of these suppliers, the Company may not be able to identify or qualify alternative suppliers in the short-term which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCertain of our businesses rely on highly specialized suppliers or foundries for critical materials, components or subassemblies that are used in our products which, in some cases, may be sole sourced from such suppliers or foundries or, such suppliers or foundries may also be a strategic supplier to one of our competitors or a customer. In either of these cases, should an event occur which affects the ability or willingness of any of such supplier or foundry to continue to deliver materials or components to us in a timely manner, we may not be able to identify or qualify an alternative supplier in a timely manner which, in any such period and future periods, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Potential events or occurrences which could cause business or supply disruptions or affect the ability or willingness of a supplier or foundry to continue to supply us include changes in market strategy, the acquisition of, sale or, other change in control or ownership structure of a supplier or foundry, strategic divestiture, bankruptcy, insolvency or other financial difficulties, business disruptions, operational issues or capacity constraints at a supplier or foundry.\nOur revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights or if intellectual property litigation is successful against us.\nWe employ various measures to maintain, protect and defend our intellectual property, including enforcing our intellectual property rights in various jurisdictions and forums throughout the world. However, policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming and these measures may not prevent our intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, copied, disclosed or circumvented. We also may not be successful in litigation or other actions to enforce our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Litigation, if necessary, may result in retaliatory legal proceedings alleging infringement by us of intellectual property owned by others. We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including collecting royalties for use of certain patents included in our patent portfolio in certain foreign jurisdictions due to, among other things: policies of foreign governments; challenges to our licensing practices under such jurisdictions\u2019 competition laws; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and/or challenges pending before foreign patent authorities as to the validity of our patents and those owned by competitors and other parties.\nThe expense of protecting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property, or defending claims that our products, technology or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, can vary significantly period to period and, in any given period, could be material and adversely impact our operating results. In addition, in any period, we may have liability for damages arising out of adverse judgments for intellectual property claims in certain jurisdictions and forums that may be material and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets may become impaired, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and the balances of these assets could increase in the future if we acquire other businesses. At December 31, 2015, the balance of our goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets was $1.2 billion and the total market value of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares was $1.2 billion. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we review our goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In addition, we test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in stock price and market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, reduced future cash flow estimates, adverse changes in legal factors, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets is determined to exist, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nOn February 18, 2016, our closing stock price was $11.09 per share, which implies a market capitalization of $981.1 million. The book value of our total stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2015 was $1,006.8 million. Should our market capitalization remain below the book value of our total stockholders\u2019 equity for a sustained period, we may conclude that the fair value of certain of our intangible or long-lived assets are materially impaired. In this case, we would be required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States to record a non-cash charge to our earnings which could adversely impact our financial results.\nA significant amount of our cash and cash equivalents are located outside of the United States and our ability to repatriate or access that cash is limited and subject to changes in domestic and foreign tax legislation.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the United States. As of December 31, 2015, $59.7 million of our $63.3 million consolidated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States. Should we have a significant need for cash that we cannot fulfill through borrowings, equity offerings or other internal or external sources, we may experience unfavorable tax and earnings consequences if we were forced to repatriate cash from outside the United States.\nIn addition, recently, there have been proposals from Congress and the President to change existing U.S. tax laws in a manner that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although it is uncertain whether, when or in what form, any of these proposals may be enacted or become effective, if any such legislation is enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in selling our MCE speaker and receiver product line, or selling the product line on favorable terms, which, in either case, will have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOn February 11, 2016, we announced our intention to sell our MCE speaker and receiver product line. As of December 31, 2015, the MCE speaker and receiver product line had total assets of $441.1 million, comprised primarily of goodwill of $328.6 million which is attributable to the MCE segment, current assets of $90.8 million, and property, plant and equipment of $19.8 million. On a standalone basis, the MCE speaker and receiver product line had liabilities of $51.8 million, primarily current liabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding a buyer for this product line or, if a buyer is identified, that we will be successful in negotiating favorable terms of a sale, including the purchase price. Depending upon the ultimate terms of a sale transaction, we could incur a loss on the sale of the MCE speaker and receiver product line or incur impairment charges in addition to those previously incurred for this product line. Alternatively, if we are unable to sell the MCE speaker and receiver product line, we will evaluate our options for the product line including undertaking a restructuring of the associated business or exiting the market served by this product line altogether, which, in either event, would likely result in material charges being incurred and a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition.\nOur foreign operations, supply chain and global expansion strategy are subject to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nMany of our manufacturing operations, research and development operations, vendors and suppliers are located outside the United States and if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global operations our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted. These risks include:\no\npolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;\no\ngovernment embargoes or trade restrictions;\no\nimport and export controls;\no\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\no\nlabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\no\nincreased compliance costs, including costs of due diligence;\no\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and\no\nearthquakes, floods or other natural disasters or catastrophic events.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nOur future success depends largely on the continued service and efforts of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them, particularly in an environment of cost reductions and a general move toward more performance-based compensation for executives and key management.\nImplementing our business strategy also requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. Competition for such experienced technical personnel in our industry and where we are located is intense, and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel. For example, a considerable amount of our operations are located in China and there is substantial competition in China for qualified and capable personnel, particularly experienced engineers and technical personnel, which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees. If we are unable to attract and retain such qualified employees, our business and our ability to execute our business strategies may be impaired.\nWe have and continue to invest in strategic acquisitions and make strategic investments that, if not successful, could adversely affect our financial results or fail to create or sustain stockholder value.\nWe engage in acquisitions and make strategic investments, which are important to our business strategy, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We have acquired businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets and may enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies that may be private and early-stage. Our acquisitions and strategic investments are generally focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications. Many of our acquisitions or strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and require the use of domestic and/or foreign capital. We cannot assure that our acquisitions or strategic investments will be successful in realizing anticipated cost synergies, generate financial returns, be accretive within projected time frames or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies, products or services.\nIn part due to our inexperience with certain adjacent or complimentary technologies and in geographic regions which may be served by acquired businesses, we may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits that we expect to realize from such acquisitions or investments and we may not achieve them. For example, we recently acquired Audience, Inc. (\u201cAudience\u201d) to expand our ability to deliver intelligent audio solutions. We cannot provide assurance however that that acquisition will be successful in realizing the anticipated cost synergies, that the Audience acquisition will be accretive within our projected time frame, or that our or Audience\u2019s operations, business and financial results will improve.\nFurther, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other benefits from acquisitions and strategic investments within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We may not, for example, be able to retain key employees from the acquired company, retain key customers or suppliers of the acquired company, integrate critical business systems or derive commercial value from the acquired company\u2019s technology and, as a result or, for other unrelated reasons, we may experience delays in our timing for achieving cost synergies or higher than expected costs in implementing them. If we do not succeed in these efforts, if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, if our estimates and assumptions are not correct, if we experience delays or, if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn some cases, we also may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired an ownership interest. In addition, depending on our operating performance or that of the acquired business or investment, we may record impairment charges related to our acquisitions or strategic investments. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic investments or other transactions will have a negative impact on our financial results, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.\nOur stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly which may adversely impact investor confidence and employee retention.\nOur common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. Volatility in our stock price can be driven many factors including divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts or the expectations of the market, market conditions in our industry, announcements that we, our competitors, vendors or our customers may make regarding their operating results, technological innovations, the gain or loss of customers or key opportunities and the risks identified and discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. During fiscal 2015, our closing stock price ranged from a high of $24.97 per share to a low of $12.74 per share. Our common stock is also included in certain market indices, and any change in the composition of these indices to exclude our company would adversely affect our stock price. Global financial markets have experienced volatility in 2015 and 2016 that has affected the market price of many technology companies, with such volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.\nFurther, securities class action litigation often is often brought against a public company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nOur credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe credit agreement governing our term loan and revolving credit facility contains covenants requiring us to, among other things, maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA. In the past, we have obtained amendments from the lenders under the credit agreement which have allowed us to comply with the financial covenants but there can be no assurance that in the future the lenders will agree to such amendments and our inability to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere are risks associated with our indebtedness.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have negative consequences, including:\no\nrequiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;\no\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or other general corporate and other purposes;\no\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\no\nincreasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.\nOur ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: repatriate funds to the United States at substantial tax cost; refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such financing and/or refinancing are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such financing and/or refinancing would increase. If there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future and/or the terms of the financing could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations globally.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we have and will continue to restructure our business to leverage our operations, generate higher margins and maximize shareholder value. These restructurings often include moving production between facilities or to new facilities, closing facilities, reducing staff levels, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management. Restructurings present significant potential risks that could adversely affect our businesses, including delays in finalizing the scope of and implementing, the restructurings (including extensive consultations concerning potential workforce reductions and obtaining agreements from our affected customers for the relocation of our facilities in certain instances), the failure to achieve targeted cost savings, impacts on product quality and delivery interruptions and the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements. These risks are further complicated by the fact that our restructuring is multi-jurisdictional which subjects it to various legal and regulatory requirements that may affect our ability to restructure our operations as planned.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate which will impact our future financial results.\nOur effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of our earnings among countries having differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws where we operate. We cannot give any assurance as to the stability or predictability of our effective tax rate in the future because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax laws and policies of the countries where we operate.\nFurther, our tax returns are subject to periodic reviews or audits by domestic and international authorities and these audits may result in allocations of income and/or deductions that result in tax assessments different from amounts that we have estimated. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these audits or that our tax provisions will ultimately be adequate to satisfy any associated tax liability. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase or if the Company\u2019s tax liabilities exceed our estimates and provisions for such taxes, the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur effective tax rate is favorably impacted by tax holidays granted to us by certain foreign jurisdictions. These tax holidays are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including exceeding certain annual thresholds of operating expenses and gross sales. We expect to continue to satisfy all of the conditions but if we fail to satisfy such conditions, our effective tax rate may be significantly adversely impacted. For additional detail, see Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nMoreover, tax rates and laws in the countries where we operate may change, or tax reforms may be enacted domestically or abroad which adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and future reported financial results or our ability to continue to structure and conduct our business as is done currently.\nWe are subject to potentially material liability for breaches of confidentiality agreements with certain of our top customers.\nWe have entered into non-disclosure agreements with several of our top customers which require us not to disclose and to protect certain information regarding, among other things, aspects of those customers\u2019 businesses plans, products and technology. These confidentiality agreements, in some cases, impose strict liability on the Company in the event of any breach of these agreements by us or our employees or agents and, should such a breach occur, the Company\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.\nThe Company\u2019s networks, servers, applications, computers, mobile devices and any confidential data that is stored or sent using such systems, software or devices or which are stored on third party cloud services which the Company leverages are vulnerable to cyber attacks and cyber breaches which, if successful, could result in loss of valuable intellectual property and trade secrets, disclosure of confidential customer or commercial data or disclosure of government classified information and subject the company to civil liability, fines or penalties which could be material. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are increasingly more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have identified several incidents of unauthorized access, to date, none have caused material damage to our business. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent any security breach results in the disclosure of certain of our customers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 confidential information, we may incur liability to such customers or business partners under confidentiality agreements that we are party to with such parties. We expect to continue to devote resources to the security of our information technology systems.\nOur existing foreign operations and ability to expand internationally may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States particularly in countries where unofficial payments, gifts or gratuities are part of the business culture and we engage agents in those countries which heightens our risks of exposure to improper actions. Although we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will prevent violations by our employees, agents or business partners of U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such violations of these laws or improper actions by such parties could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties or stockholder lawsuits and could damage our reputation.\nOur net exposure to exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe conduct a significant amount of business outside the United States and adverse movements in currency exchange rates, particularly the Malaysian ringgit, the euro, the Chinese renminbi (yuan) and the Philippine peso, may, in any period or period(s), negatively affect our business and our operating results due to a number of factors, including, among others:\no\nOur products are manufactured and sold outside the United States increase our net exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.\no\nOur products, which are typically sold in U.S. dollars, may become less price-competitive outside the United States as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates;\no\nCertain of our revenues that are derived from customer sales denominated in foreign currencies could decrease;\no\nOur foreign suppliers may raise their prices if they are impacted by currency fluctuations, resulting in higher than expected costs and lower margins;\no\nForeign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations may require the payment of structuring fees, limit the U.S. dollar value of royalties from licensees\u2019 sales that are denominated in foreign currencies, cause earnings volatility if the hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting and expose us to counterparty risk if the counterparty fails to perform; or\no\nThe cost of materials, products, services and other expenses outside the United States could be adversely impacted by a weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nOur products are complex and could contain defects, which could result in material costs to us and harm our business.\nOur products are complex and could contain defects, which could result in material costs to us. Product development in the markets we serve is becoming more focused on audio signal processing for improved audio performance and to enable intelligent and more sophisticated audio solutions. The increasing complexity of our products increases the risk that we or our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have been shipped. This could result in material costs and other adverse consequences to us including, but not limited to: reduced margins, damage to our reputation, a material product recall, replacement costs for product warranty and support, payments to our customers related to recall claims as a result of various industry or business practices, a delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance, and a diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial losses or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability or warranty claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. In particular, the sale of systems and components that are incorporated into mobile handsets for the global mobile phone industry involves a high degree of risk that such claims may be made. Due to the complex nature of our products, quality and reliability issues may arise after significant volumes of a product have shipped. While we have attempted to contractually limit our financial exposure with many of our customers for such claims, a warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a customer product recall, could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, our products are typically sold to customers at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the customer\u2019s products in which they are incorporated. Because a defect in one of our products could give rise to failures in the products that incorporate them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues we receive from the products involved and because we are self-insured for matters relating to product quality a significant claim(s) could adversely affect our financial position. Moreover, to the extent a defect in one of our products is caused by a defective component supplied to us by a third party, we may nonetheless be held liable to the customer and may be unable to seek or unsuccessful in seeking indemnification from our supplier.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property rights and on our business.\nWe may use software licensed for use from third-party authors under open source licenses in certain of our products. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and in less time and result in a loss of product sales for us. It is possible that our use of open source software may trigger the foregoing requirements. Furthermore, there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Recent Spin-Off From Our Former Parent\nWe have limited history operating as an independent publicly-traded company and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company and therefore may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe were spun-off from our Former Parent on February 28, 2014 and have limited operating history as an independent publicly-traded company. The financial information in this Form 10-K for periods prior to the Separation reflects our business as part of our Former Parent. Accordingly, such financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future.\nFor additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical Consolidated Financial Statements of our business, see the sections entitled \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the historical financial statements and accompanying notes under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nPotential indemnification liabilities to our Former Parent pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement between us and our Former Parent provides, among other things, that we will indemnify our Former Parent for substantially all liabilities relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Separation. If we are required to indemnify our Former Parent under the Separation and Distribution Agreement or other agreements in any period or periods, we may be subject to substantial liabilities that may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities of our Former Parent following the Separation.\nUnder the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of our Former Parent\u2019s U.S. consolidated group for all or a portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire U.S. consolidated group of our Former Parent. Consequently, if our Former Parent is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a prior period, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the Tax Matters Agreement between us and our Former Parent. Other provisions of federal and state law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities. These potential tax liabilities could be material in any period or periods, and should we be held liable for such liabilities, our operating results in any such period or periods may be adversely affected.\nIf the Distribution (as defined below), together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our Former Parent and our stockholders could be subject to a significant tax liability and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify our Former Parent for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement.\nA tax opinion of tax counsel to our Former Parent which concluded that the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock to stockholders of our Former Parent in connection with the Separation (the \u201cDistribution\u201d) qualifies as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes as well as a Private Letter Ruling issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) which reached the same conclusion regarding the Distribution, relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from our Former Parent and us, including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. As of the end of fiscal 2015, we were not aware of anything that would make those facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings incorrect.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement between our Former Parent and us, we are required to indemnify our Former Parent against taxes incurred by our Former Parent that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take, as the case may be, certain actions that result in the Distribution failing to qualify for tax-free treatment. Also, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are required to indemnify our Former Parent for one-half of the taxes and other liabilities incurred by our Former Parent if the Distribution fails to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution for reasons other than an act or failure to act on the part of us or our Former Parent and therefore we might be required to indemnify our Former Parent for such taxes and liabilities due to circumstances and events not within our control. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are also required to indemnify our Former Parent for one-half of certain taxes incurred as a result of the restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the Distribution. Our indemnification obligations to our Former Parent under the Tax Matters Agreement are not limited by a maximum amount. If we are required to indemnify our Former Parent under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be subject to substantial tax liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Governance\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile stockholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder activism, which could cause the Company to incur significant expense, hinder execution of its business strategy and impact the trading value of the Company\u2019s securities. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and the Company is subject to the risks associated with such activism. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors, potentially interfering with the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plan. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future direction, adversely affect its relationships with key executives and business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, the Company may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described in this discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nEach of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and Delaware law, as currently in effect, contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\no\nthe inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting or act by written consent;\no\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\no\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\no\nthe division of our Board of Directors into three approximately equal classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;\no\na provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\no\nthe ability of our directors, without a stockholder vote, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board of Directors); and\no\nthe requirement that stockholders holding at least 80% of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws.\nIn addition, current Delaware law includes provisions which limit the ability of persons that, without prior board approval, acquire more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or purchases of additional shares, for a three-year period following the acquisition by such persons of more than 15 percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we would be required to indemnify our Former Parent for the tax imposed under Section 355(e) of the Code resulting from an acquisition or issuance of our stock, even if we did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. Should such indemnity obligation be triggered, such obligation may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that could be supported by our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14487, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "KN"}
