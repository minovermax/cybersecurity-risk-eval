{"cik": "700733", "company": "NATIONAL PENN BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Related to the Merger\nNational Penn will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect its business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on National Penn, and, consequently, the surviving corporation. These uncertainties could cause customers and others that deal with National Penn to seek to change their existing business relationships with National Penn. In addition, the uncertainties may impair National Penn\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving corporation following the merger. Also, the merger agreement restricts National Penn from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of BB&T, and generally requires National Penn to continue its operations in the ordinary course, until the merger closes. These restrictions may prevent National Penn from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: the approval of the merger proposal by National Penn shareholders, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof, the accuracy of representations and warranties under the merger agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement), BB&T\u2019s and National Penn\u2019s performance of their respective obligations under the merger agreement in all material respects and each of BB&T\u2019s and National Penn\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the merger will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While shareholder and regulatory approvals have been obtained, the remaining conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed by August 17, 2016, either BB&T or National Penn may choose not to proceed with the merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval. In addition, BB&T and National Penn may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, National Penn may be required to pay a termination fee of $64.5 million to BB&T.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of National Penn.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of National Penn may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, National Penn would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nNational Penn may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;\n\u2022\nNational Penn may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees;\n\u2022\nNational Penn will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed;\n\u2022\nNational Penn will have been bound by certain restrictions on the conduct of its businesses prior to completion of the merger. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of BB&T (not to be unreasonably withheld), may prevent National Penn from making certain acquisitions or taking certain other specified actions during the pendency of the merger; and\n\u2022\nNational Penn\u2019s management team will have devoted substantial commitments of time and resources to matters relating to the merger (including integration planning), and would otherwise have devoted their time and resources to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to National Penn as an independent company.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the merger agreement is terminated and National Penn\u2019s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, National Penn shareholders cannot be certain that National Penn will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration BB&T has agreed to provide in the merger. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, National Penn may be required to pay a termination fee of $64.5 million to BB&T.\nRisk Factors Related to the Operation of National Penn\nDifficult conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, and these conditions may not significantly improve in the near future.\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. Concerns over the slow economic recovery, the level of national debt, unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, the housing market, inflation levels, the U.S. debt ceiling, the European sovereign debt crisis, energy costs and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. As a result, the market for fixed income instruments has experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased probability of default. Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and may be hard to dispose of. Domestic and international equity markets have also experienced periods of heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers (such as National Penn) that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage, automobile and credit markets particularly affected. These events and other market disturbances may have an adverse effect on us, in part because a portion of our assets are investment securities and also because we are dependent upon customer behavior. Our revenues, including net interest income, and our net interest margin are susceptible to decline in such circumstances, and our profit margins could erode. In addition, in the event of extreme and prolonged market events, such as the global financial crisis, we could incur significant losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.\nFactors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the profitability of our business. In an economic climate characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial products could be adversely affected. Concerns with respect to the U.S. government\u2019s level of debt and possible resulting fiscal actions and other budgetary and spending matters could contribute to the risk of slower economic growth. The nature and ultimate resolution of these issues, or a failure to achieve a timely and effective resolution, may adversely affect the U.S. economy through possible consequences including further downgrades in the ratings for U.S. Treasury securities, government shutdowns, or substantial spending cuts resulting from sequestration. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNational Penn is subject to pervasive and comprehensive federal and state regulatory requirements and possible regulatory enforcement actions, which may harm its business and financial results, its reputation, and its share price.\nNational Penn is supervised by the Federal Reserve, and National Penn Bank is supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d). Accordingly, National Penn and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state legislation, regulation, and supervision that govern almost all aspects of business operations, which puts each of them at risk of being the subject of a formal or informal supervisory enforcement action. The expansive regulatory framework is primarily designed to protect consumers, depositors and the government's deposit insurance funds, and to accomplish other governmental policy objectives such as combating terrorism; that framework is not designed to protect shareholders. Areas such as Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) compliance (including BSA and related anti-money laundering regulations) and real estate-secured consumer lending (such as Truth-in-Lending regulations, changes in Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulations, implementation of licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators and more recently, heightened regulatory attention to mortgage and foreclosure-related activities and exposures) are being confronted with escalating regulatory expectations and scrutiny. While National Penn has policies and procedures designed to prevent regulatory violations, there is a risk that such violations will occur. Failure by National Penn to comply with these requirements could result in adverse action by regulators, which would negatively affect National Penn's reputation and could adversely affect National Penn's ability to manage its business, and as a result, could adversely affect National Penn's shareholders.\nThe impact of legislation, including proposed legislation, and government programs adopted in response to the economic downturn, the U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns cannot be predicted at this time, and such legislation is subject to change.\nNew or changed governmental legislation or regulation and accounting industry pronouncements, including additional regulations and increased supervision resulting from additional growth in assets, could adversely affect National Penn.\nChanges in federal and state legislation and regulation, including additional regulations and increased supervision resulting from additional growth in assets, may adversely affect National Penn's operations. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act continues to require significant changes to the U.S. financial system, including among others:\n\u2022\nRequirements on banking, derivative and investment activities, including: the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business demand accounts, debit card interchange fee requirements, and compliance with the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d which restricts proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or the acquisition or retention of ownership interests in, private equity funds.\n\u2022\nThe creation of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection with supervisory authority, including the power to conduct examinations and take enforcement actions with respect to financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or more.\n\u2022\nThe Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has issued new regulations that may have a significant impact on compliance requirements for National Penn Bank, including in the area of mortgage lending activities.\n\u2022\nThe creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose a systemic risk.\n\u2022\nStress testing requirements for bank holding companies with assets over $10 billion.\n\u2022\nProvisions affecting corporate governance and executive compensation of all companies subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirement that National Penn submit its executive compensation program to an advisory (non-binding) shareholder vote.\n\u2022\nA provision that broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments.\n\u2022\nA provision that requires bank regulators to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as strong as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries, subject to a grandfather clause for holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009.\nSome of these provisions have yet to be implemented because the issuance of some rules has been delayed and the deadlines for adoption of other rules have not yet been reached.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board unanimously approved its final rule implementing Basel III. The rule was subsequently approved as a final rule by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on July 9, 2013 and requires banking organizations, such as National Penn, to calculate their risk-weighted assets under the final rule's standardized approach. The rule was effective January 2015, with some additional transition periods, and requires compliance with the revised definitions of regulatory capital, revised minimum capital ratios, and revised regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, among other issues. National Penn is also subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations.\nThe impact of legislation, including proposed legislation, and government programs adopted in response to the economic downturn, the U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns cannot be predicted at this time, and such legislation is subject to change. National Penn cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in financial market regulation or accounting rules and interpretations will have on National Penn. National Penn will have to devote a substantial amount of management and financial resources to ensure compliance with such regulatory changes, including all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing rules as they are finalized and released, which may increase National Penn's costs of operations. In addition, in some cases, National Penn's ability to comply with regulatory changes may be dependent on third party vendors taking timely action to achieve compliance. Any such changes may also negatively affect National Penn's financial performance, the calculation of its capital ratios, its ability to expand its products and services and/or to increase the value of its business and, as a result, could be materially adverse to National Penn's shareholders.\nOur credit quality has been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions.\nEconomic conditions have adversely impacted National Penn\u2019s business and its results of operations, including the quality of National Penn\u2019s credit portfolio. Beginning in late 2008, we experienced a downturn in the overall credit performance of our loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio has improved in credit quality since the downturn; however, in the aftermath of recessionary conditions, national and regional economic growth has been slow and uneven and many borrowers may continue to have a decreased ability to meet their loan obligations. Delayed improvement or another period of deterioration in the quality of our credit portfolio could significantly increase non-performing loans, require additional increases in loan loss reserves, elevate charge-off levels and have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommercial, construction and real estate loans increase our exposure to credit risk.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $4.1 billion, or 66.6%, of National Penn\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. Subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to increase our origination of these loans. Commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Commercial real estate loans also typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers both at origination and at maturity. Commercial business loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower's business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. In addition, some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to a greater risk of loss.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or we may be required to make further additions to our allowance for loan losses because of credit risk exposure.\nWe maintain an allowance for possible loan losses. If the economy and/or the real estate market weakens, we may be required to add further provisions to our allowance for loan losses as nonperforming assets could increase or the value of the collateral securing loans may be insufficient to cover any remaining net loan balance, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nNational Penn reviews the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses, considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and non-performing assets, classified assets and other regulatory requirements. As a result of these considerations, National Penn evaluates the need to increase or decrease its allowance for loan losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires numerous estimates and there may be unanticipated adverse changes to the economy caused by recession, inflation, unemployment or other factors beyond National Penn's control. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, our actual losses may vary materially from our current estimates. If the credit quality of National Penn's customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, National Penn's business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nNational Penn's financial performance is directly affected by interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates may reduce profits. Our primary source of income currently is net interest income. Net interest income is the differential, or the net interest spread, between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is affected by changes in market interest rates, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market rate changes. When our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market interest rates could reduce our net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets reprice or mature more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. These rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond National Penn\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve.\nWe attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing and balance of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. However, our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at the current lower interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. A failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could materially adversely affect our net interest spread, loan origination volume, asset quality and overall profitability.\nBecause its operations are concentrated in eastern Pennsylvania, National Penn's performance and financial condition may be adversely affected by regional economic conditions and real estate values.\nNational Penn's loan activities are largely based in 13 counties in eastern Pennsylvania and, to a lesser extent, National Penn's deposit base is primarily generated from this area. As a result, our consolidated financial performance depends largely upon economic conditions in this region and demand for its products and services. Weak local economic conditions beginning in 2008 caused an increase in loan delinquencies, an increase in the number of borrowers who defaulted on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans. Delayed improvement or another decline in the regional real estate market could again harm our financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within this regional area and because a large percentage of its loans are secured by real property. If there is another decline in real estate values, the collateral for National Penn's loans will provide less security. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and we will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nDeclines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely impact the value of our investments, financial performance and capital.\nNational Penn maintains an investment portfolio that includes, but is not limited to, municipal bonds, bank equity securities, and individual trust preferred securities. The market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the bonds themselves, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in business climate, volatility in the markets, and lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities. We periodically, but not less than quarterly, evaluate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. We may be required to record additional impairment charges if investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.\nOur investment portfolio includes approximately $39.9 million in capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of Pittsburgh as of December 31, 2015. This stock ownership is required for National Penn to qualify for membership in the FHLB system, which enables it to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. If the FHLB experiences a capital shortfall, it could suspend its quarterly cash dividend, and possibly require its members, including National Penn, to make additional capital investments in the FHLB. If the FHLB was to cease operations, or if National Penn was required to write-off its investment in the FHLB, National Penn's business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not manage our capital position strategically, our return on equity could be lower compared to our competitors as a result of our high level of capital.\nIf we are unable to use strategically our excess capital, or to successfully continue our capital management programs (such as the stock repurchase program or quarterly dividends to our investors), then our goal of generating a return on average equity that is competitive, by increasing earnings per share and leveraging our capital base, without assuming undue risk, could be delayed or may not be attained. Failure to achieve a competitive return on average equity might decrease investments in our common stock and might cause our common stock to trade at lower prices.\nNational Penn may grow its business by acquiring other financial services companies, and these acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses.\nAlthough the acquisition of other financial services companies or assets is not anticipated during the pendency of the merger with BB&T, such acquisitions present risks to National Penn in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired. In general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive to investigate or to complete than expected (including unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company, as a result of delays in receipt of regulatory approvals or regulatory approval conditions which may impose additional costs on National Penn or limit National Penn\u2019s revenues). In addition, the anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains) may be significantly more difficult or take longer to achieve than expected. In some cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic markets, and these situations also present risks in instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas. As a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. The processes of integrating acquired businesses also pose many additional possible risks which could result in increased costs, liability or other adverse consequences. Finally, if an acquisition is not completed, National Penn may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees.\nAdditional growth will subject National Penn Bank to additional regulation and increased supervision.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. National Penn Bank had $9.6 billion in assets as of December 31, 2015. Although additional growth that results in National Penn Bank having assets of $10 billion or more is not anticipated during the pendency of the merger with BB&T, such growth would subject National Penn Bank to the following:\n\u2022\nSupervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022\nRegulatory stress testing requirements, whereby National Penn would be required to conduct an annual stress test (using assumptions for baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios);\n\u2022\nA modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates as a result of institutions with $10 billion or more in assets being required to bear a greater portion of the cost of raising the reserve ratio to 1.35% as required by the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u2022\nHeightened compliance standards under the Volcker Rule; and\n\u2022\nEnhanced supervision as a larger financial institution.\nThe imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision may require additional commitment of financial resources to regulatory compliance and may increase National Penn\u2019s cost of operations. Further, the results of the stress testing process may lead National Penn to retain additional capital or alter the mix of its capital components.\nNational Penn may incur impairments to goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2015, National Penn had approximately $303 million recorded as goodwill. National Penn evaluates its goodwill for impairment at least annually during the second quarter of its fiscal year. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including a low market price of National Penn's common stock, or reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to National Penn's business could result in impairments to goodwill. National Penn's valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance. National Penn operates in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If National Penn's analysis results in additional impairment to its goodwill, National Penn would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such change could have a material adverse effect on National Penn's results of operations and stock price.\nNational Penn may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums or special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, adopted in July 21, 2010, required the FDIC to increase reserves against future losses, which requires increased assessments that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than $10 billion. In addition, the FDIC may issue a special assessment across all FDIC insured institutions. Any future increases in assessments or higher periodic fees could adversely affect National Penn's earnings.\nCompetition from other financial institutions may adversely affect National Penn's profitability.\nNational Penn Bank faces substantial competition in originating loans, both commercial and consumer. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of National Penn's competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. Intensified competition from these institutions and/or economic conditions could reduce National Penn's net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that National Penn Bank originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, National Penn Bank faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of National Penn's competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than National Penn, which could decrease the deposits that National Penn attracts or require National Penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect National Penn's ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, National Penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase National Penn's cost of funds.\nNational Penn Bank and National Penn's non-banking subsidiaries and divisions also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms. Some of National Penn's non-bank competitors are subject to less extensive regulations than those governing National Penn's banking operations. Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over National Penn Bank and its non-banking subsidiaries in providing financial products and services. This competition may reduce or limit National Penn's margins on banking and non-banking services, reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition.\nInability to hire or retain key personnel could adversely affect National Penn's business.\nNational Penn and its subsidiaries face intense competition from various other financial institutions, as well as from non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies and government organizations, for the attraction and retention of key personnel. As a result, National Penn may not be able to attract or retain talented employees, specifically those who generate and maintain National Penn's customer relationships and serve in other key operation positions in the areas of finance, credit administration, loan functions and information technology. The inability to hire or retain key personnel may result in the loss of potential and/or existing substantial customer relationships and may adversely affect National Penn's ability to compete effectively.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nWe depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including, but not limited to, electrical or telecommunications outages and, as described below, cyber attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage and investment advisory businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of National Penn\u2019s or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt National Penn\u2019s or its customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nThird parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement our Internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and the outsourcing of some of our business operations. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for National Penn. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, financial losses, the inability of our customers to transact business with us, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including customer relationship management, internet banking, website, general ledger, investment, deposit, loan servicing and loan origination systems. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of inadequate or interrupted service, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us, and replacing these third party vendors could result in significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations as well as reputational risk.\nIf National Penn's information technology is unable to keep pace with its growth or industry developments, National Penn's financial performance may suffer.\nEffective and competitive delivery of National Penn's products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes, both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors, such as firms which license their software solutions to National Penn. National Penn's continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of National Penn's competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves, as is occurring in the payments industry, keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for National Penn. There can be no assurance that National Penn will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the ongoing development and increasing use of \"social media\" presents challenges and opportunities that can lead to product communication and innovation issues as well as reputation risk.\nNational Penn's internal control systems are inherently limited.\nNational Penn's systems of internal controls, disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures are inherently limited. The inherent limitations of National Penn's system of internal controls include the use of judgment in decision-making that can be faulty; breakdowns can occur because of human error or mistakes; and controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected, which may have an adverse effect on National Penn's business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, any plans of remediation for any identified limitations may be ineffective in improving National Penn's internal controls.\nOur capital management strategy could dilute tangible book value per share.\nAlthough many capital management initiatives are designed to accrete earnings per share, these initiatives may dilute tangible book value. Under certain circumstances, the repurchase of common stock can be accretive to earnings per share while also dilutive to tangible book value. Likewise, under certain circumstances in an acquisition or merger, including the use of cash as a component of the consideration can have a dilutive effect on tangible book value. Neither stock repurchases nor the acquisition of other companies is anticipated during the pendency of the merger with BB&T.\nThere may be other dilution of National Penn's shareholders, which may adversely affect the market price of National Penn's common stock.\nExcept as limited under the merger agreement with BB&T, National Penn is not restricted from issuing additional common shares, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares. National Penn is currently authorized to issue up to 250 million common shares, of which approximately 140 million shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2015, and up to one million shares of preferred stock, none of which are outstanding. In addition, National Penn's Board of Directors has made shares available for compensation purposes, including under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as well as for purchase under National Penn's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows employee shareholders to purchase shares of National Penn common shares at a 10% discount from market value. In addition, shares are issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units and/or exercise of stock options that have been, or stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and restricted stock that may be, issued under National Penn's equity compensation plans. Should National Penn experience strong participation in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, the issuance of the required shares of common stock may significantly dilute the ownership of National Penn's shareholders. Except as limited under the merger agreement with BB&T, National Penn's board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of its authorized but unissued shares. Authorized but unissued shares could be issued on terms or in circumstances that could dilute the interests of other shareholders.\nNational Penn relies on dividends it receives from its subsidiaries, may reduce or eliminate cash dividends on its common stock, and is subject to restrictions on its ability to declare or pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of common stock.\nAs a bank holding company, National Penn's ability to pay dividends depends primarily on its receipt of dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Its bank subsidiary, National Penn Bank, is National Penn's primary source of dividends. In addition to limits imposed by the merger agreement, dividend payments from National Penn Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings, imposed by bank regulatory agencies. The ability of National Penn Bank to pay dividends is also subject to profitability, financial condition, regulatory capital requirements, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. As of December 31, 2015, National Penn Bank had the ability to pay dividends to National Penn without prior regulatory approval. However, there is no assurance that National Penn Bank, and/or National Penn's other subsidiaries, will be able to pay dividends in the future.\nIn October 2015, the Board of Directors approved a fourth quarter 2015 cash dividend of $0.11 per share, and in January 2016, the Board of Directors approved a first quarter 2016 cash dividend of $0.11 per share. There can be no assurance that National Penn will pay dividends to its shareholders in the future, or if dividends are paid, that National Penn will maintain or increase the level of its dividends. National Penn's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is subject to limitations and guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve. For example, under Federal Reserve guidance, bank holding companies generally are advised to consult in advance with the Federal Reserve before declaring dividends, and to strongly consider reducing, deferring or eliminating dividends, in certain situations, such as when declaring or paying a dividend that would exceed earnings for the fiscal quarter for which the dividend is being paid, or when declaring or paying a dividend that could result in a material adverse change to the organization's capital structure. National Penn's failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on its business, operations, financial condition, access to funding and the market price of its common stock.\nSevere weather and natural disasters may negatively affect National Penn's local economies or disrupt its operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nNational Penn's market area may experience severe weather events or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, blizzards, and other extreme weather conditions. Natural disasters and other severe weather events could negatively impact regional economic conditions; result in a decline in local loan demand and loan originations; cause a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing National Penn's loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses; damage its banking facilities and offices; and negatively impact National Penn's growth strategy. National Penn's management cannot calculate the effect of or predict whether or to what extent damage caused by severe weather or natural disasters would affect National Penn's operations. National Penn's business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of such natural disasters.\nNational Penn may be a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNational Penn and its subsidiaries have been and may continue to be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of its business. An increased number of lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits and other consumer driven litigation, have been filed and will likely continue to be filed against financial institutions, which may involve substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages. National Penn believes the risk of litigation generally increases during downturns in the national and local economies. National Penn's insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm National Penn's reputation and may cause it to incur significant expense. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed National Penn's insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on National Penn's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, National Penn may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may National Penn be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.\nA Warning About Forward-Looking Information\nThis Report, including information incorporated by reference in this Report, contains forward-looking statements about National Penn and its subsidiaries.
