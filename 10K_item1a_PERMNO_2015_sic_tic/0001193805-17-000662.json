RISK FACTORS\nThe purchase of our common stock involves a very high degree of risk.\nIn evaluating us and our business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. If any of the events described in the risks below actually occurs, our financial condition or operating results may be materially and adversely affected, the price of our common stock may decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose all or a part of your investment.\nThe risks below can be characterized into three groups:\n1) Risks related to our business, including risks specific to the defense and aerospace industry:\n2) Risks arising from our indebtedness; and\n3) Risks related to our securities and our status as a public company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe suffered a net loss from operations of $10,789,000 and a net loss of $15,623,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also had negative cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, in 2015 we ceased paying dividends on our common stock and in 2016 we disposed of the real estate on which one of our operating subsidiaries is located through a sale leaseback transaction, and in January 2017 sold of one of our operating subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent thereto, we sold our debt and equity securities to secure funds to operate our business. Since September 2016 we have been issuing additional shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in lieu of cash payment of accrued dividends on our outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and since February 2017 we have issued additional convertible notes in lieu of cash payment of accrued interest on our outstanding convertible notes. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2016 we were not in compliance with our debt covenants under our loan facility with PNC Bank. The report of our independent registered public accountants on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 states that these factors create uncertainty raise about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nA reduction in government spending on defense could materially adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nA large percentage of our revenue is derived from products for US military aviation. There are risks associated with programs that are subject to appropriation by Congress, which could be potential targets for reductions in funding. Reductions in United States Government spending on defense or future changes in the mix of defense products required by United States Government agencies could limit demand for our products, and may have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on revenues from a few significant relationships, in particular with United Technology Corporation. Any loss, cancellation, reduction, or interruption in these relationships could harm our business.\nWe expect that our customer concentration will not change significantly in the near future. We derive most of our revenues from a small number of customers. Four customers represented approximately 56.4% and 59.3% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of customers which have contracts with United States governmental agencies, thereby limiting the number of potential customers. Our success depends on our ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our largest customers or that we will be able to attract additional customers, or that our customers will continue to buy our products in the same amounts as in prior years. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or interruption in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may have to make, could significantly harm our business.\nWe depend on revenues from components for a few aircraft platforms and the cancellation or reduction of either production or use of these aircraft platforms could harm our business.\nOur Complex Machining segment derives most of its revenues from components for a few aircraft platforms, specifically the Sikorsky BlackHawk helicopter, the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye naval aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas (Boeing) C-17 Globemaster, the Falcon and the Hornet. Boeing closed its C-17 production line in 2015. A reduction in demand for our products as a result of either a reduction in the production of new aircraft or a reduction in the use of existing aircraft in the fleet (reducing after-market demand) would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIntense competition in our markets may lead to a reduction in our revenues and market share.\nThe defense and aerospace component manufacturing market is highly competitive and we expect that competition will increase and perhaps intensify as the overall market remains static or declines. Many competitors have significantly greater technical, manufacturing, financial and marketing resources than we do. We expect that more companies will enter the defense and aerospace component manufacturing market. We may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors. Increased competition could result in reduced revenue, lower margins or loss of market share, any of which could significantly harm our business our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may lose sales if our suppliers fail to meet our needs.\nAlthough we procure most of our parts and components from multiple sources or believe that these components are readily available from numerous sources, certain components are available only from a sole or limited number or sources. While we believe that substitute components or assemblies could be obtained, use of substitutes would require development of new suppliers or would require us to re-engineer our products, or both, which could delay shipment of our products and could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Recently, we have had difficulties in securing timely shipments of raw materials from certain vendors due to our liquidity problems.\nThere are risks associated with the bidding processes in which we compete.\nWe obtain many contracts through a competitive bidding process. We must devote substantial time and resources to prepare bids and proposals and may not have contracts awarded to us. Even if we win contracts, there can be no assurance that the prices that we have bid will be sufficient to allow us to generate a profit from any particular contract. There are significant costs involved with producing a small number of initial units of any new product and it may not be possible to recoup such costs on later production runs.\nDue to fixed contract pricing, increasing contract costs expose us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business.\nThe cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nThe prices of raw materials we use are volatile.\nThe prices of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are volatile. If the prices of raw materials rise we may not be able to pass along such increases to our customers and this could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials could adversely impact our customers\u2019 demand for certain products which could lead to a reduction in our revenues and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nSome of the products we produce have long lead times.\nSome of the products we produce, particularly those of our Complex Machining segment, require months to produce and we sometimes produce products in excess of the number ordered intending to sell the excess as spares when orders arise. As a result, portions of our inventory turn slowly and tie up our working capital, and our inventory often represents approximately 40% of our assets. Any requirement to write down the value of our inventory due to obsolescence or a drop in the price of materials could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nWe do not own the intellectual property rights to products we produce.\nNearly all the parts and subassemblies we produce are built to customer specifications and the customer owns the intellectual property, if any, related to the product. Consequently, if a customer desires to use another manufacturer to fabricate its part or subassembly, it would be free to do so.\nThere are risks associated with new programs.\nNew programs typically carry risks associated with design changes, acquisition of new production tools, funding commitments, imprecise or changing specifications, timing delays and the accuracy of cost estimates associated with such programs. In addition, any new program may experience delays for a variety of reasons after significant expenditures are made. If we were unable to perform under new programs to the customers\u2019 satisfaction or if a new program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or other problems, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. This could result in low margin or forward loss contracts, and the risk of having to write-off costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts if it were deemed to be unrecoverable over the life of the program.\nTo perform on new programs we may be required to incur up-front costs which may not have been separately negotiated. Additionally, we may have made assumptions related to the costs of any program which may be material and which may be incorrect, resulting in costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to address potential market opportunities and to manage expenses to match our ability to finance operations.\nThe need to control our expenses will place a significant strain on our management and operational resources. If we are unable to control our expenses effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur inability to successfully manage the growth of our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to experience growth in the number of employees and the scope of our operations as a result of internal growth and through acquisitions. This will result in increased responsibilities for management and could strain our financial and other resources. There can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate any future business acquired through acquisition.\nOur ability to manage and support our growth effectively is substantially dependent on our ability to implement adequate improvements to financial, inventory, management controls, reporting, union relationships, order entry systems and other procedures, and hire sufficient numbers of financial, accounting, administrative, and management personnel. We may not succeed in our efforts to identify, attract and retain experienced personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that we have the management expertise to successfully integrate the operations of any company that we might acquire in the future.\nAttracting and retaining key personnel is an essential element of our future success.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate executive and other key employees. Experienced management and technical, marketing and support personnel in the defense and aerospace industries are in demand and competition for their talents is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to strict governmental regulations relating to the environment, which could result in fines and remediation expense in the event of non-compliance.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous substances into the environment. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. In addition, these regulations may impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our facilities without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such substances. Furthermore, we are required to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances. Our operations require the use of chemicals and other materials for painting and cleaning that are classified under applicable laws as hazardous chemicals and substances. If we are found not to be in compliance with any of these rules, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines, remediation expenses and the obligation to change our business practice, any of which could result in substantial costs that would adversely impact our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to fines and disqualification for non-compliance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have never been subject to such fines or disqualification.\nTerrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnited States and global responses to the Middle East conflict, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical threats and other global crises increase uncertainties with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets. Several factors associated, directly or indirectly, with the Middle East conflict, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical threats, and other global crises and responses thereto, may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness may materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (the \u201cLoan Facility\u201d). The indebtedness under the Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. In the case of a continuing default under our Loan Facility, the lender will have the right to foreclose on our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also have substantial amounts outstanding in the form of 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes (the \u201c8% Notes\u201d). To the extent we are not able to pay accrued interest on the 8% Notes due to restrictions set forth in the Loan Facility or otherwise, we may issue additional 8% Notes in payment of such accrued interest in lieu of cash (\u201cPIK Notes\u201d).\nOur leverage may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations and capital needs, may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and may make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic conditions.\nOur Indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends.\nThe terms of our Loan Facility require that we maintain certain financial covenants and that we may pay dividends on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) and Common Stock only if after taking such dividend into effect we satisfy certain prescribed financial conditions. It is likely that any loan facility we might enter into in replacement of, or in addition to, the Loan Facility would contain similar provisions. If, in the future, we are unable to meet these conditions, we may need to seek covenant changes or we would have to pay all of the dividends accrued for such periods in additional shares of Series a Preferred Stock (\u201cPIK Shares\u201d). There can be no assurance our lenders would agree to covenant changes acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may in the future incur indebtedness or otherwise become subject to agreements whose terms restrict our ability to pay dividends. In addition, no payment or adjustment will be made upon conversion for any undeclared or, subject to limited exceptions, unpaid dividends.\nRisks Related to our Securities and our Status as a Public Company\nSeries A Preferred Stock:\nThere is no public market for our Series A Preferred Stock.\nThere is currently no public market for our Series A Preferred Stock on any national securities exchange or for quotation through OTC Markets or any other quotation service. Consequently, it is unlikely that a trading market will develop for the Series A Preferred Stock and that due to the absence of liquidity, you may not be able to sell your shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the price you paid to acquire them, if at all.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our liabilities and will not limit our ability to incur indebtedness and other liabilities that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Shares.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our liabilities. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding-up, our assets will be available to make payments of dividends on and liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock ranks structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries and the rights of any equity holders (other than us) of those subsidiaries. We are a holding company and our ability to pay dividends or otherwise make payments in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock may be limited. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding. We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial amounts of additional debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, and the terms of Series A Preferred Stock will not limit the amount of such debt or other obligations that we may incur. In addition, our subsidiaries may issue capital stock or other ownership interests to third parties.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have no rights as a holder of our common stock until they acquire our common stock.\nUntil a holder acquires shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, he will have no rights with respect to our Common Stock, other than voting rights. Upon acquiring shares of our common stock through conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to exercise the rights of a holder of Common Stock only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the date such holder of Series A Preferred Stock acquires such shares of our Common Stock.\nCommon Stock:\nThere is only a limited public market for our Common Stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT. However, trading volume has been limited and a more active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained over time. The lack of a robust market may impair a stockholder's ability to sell shares of our Common Stock. In the absence of a more active trading market, any attempt to sell a substantial number of our shares could result in a decrease in the price of our stock. Specifically, you may not be able to resell your shares of Common Stock at or above the price you paid for such shares or at all.\nMoreover, sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the price of our common stock. As a result, you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock in short time periods, or possibly at all, and the price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur future revenues are inherently unpredictable; our operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline significantly.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of performance. Some of the factors that could cause quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include conditions inherent in government contracting and our business such as the timing of cost and expense recognition for contracts, the United States Government contracting and budget cycles, introduction of new government regulations and standards, contract closeouts, variations in manufacturing efficiencies, our ability to obtain components and subassemblies from contract manufacturers and suppliers, general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the defense market. Because we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term, any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our business.\nFluctuations in quarterly results, competition or announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation may cause earnings to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In this event, the trading price of our Common Stock could significantly decline. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the future market price of our Common Stock, as well as our overall operating results. Consequently, our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance.\nWe may not be able to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock is limited by the terms of our Loan Facility (and the terms of any future indebtedness or other agreements), the Certificate of Designation authorizing the issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock, under applicable law, and our status as a holding company.\nFuture financings or acquisitions may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales or issuances of our Common Stock, including the issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or our outstanding 8% Notes, upon exercise of our outstanding warrants or as part of future financings or acquisitions, would be substantially dilutive to the outstanding shares of Common Stock. Any dilution or potential dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares, which would contribute to a downward movement in the price of Common Stock.\nFuture issuances of PIK Shares in lieu of payment of cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, or of additional 8% Notes in lieu of payment of cash interest on our 8% Notes, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe are obligated to pay accrued dividends quarterly to holders of Series A Preferred Stock and accrued interest quarterly to holders of our 8% Notes. Although we may issue PIK Shares to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock if we are unable to pay cash dividends for any dividend period, or additional 8% Notes convertible into shares of Common Stock to holders of our 8% Notes if we are unable to pay accrued interest (\u201cPIK Notes\u201d) for any interest period, the issuance of PIK Shares will result in an increase in the rate of dividends payable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the issuance of PIK Notes will result in an increase in the rate of interest payable with respect to a significant portion of the 8% Notes, and in each case dilute the interests of our common stockholders. Furthermore, under the terms of the Certificate of Designation authorizing the issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock, we are not permitted to declare or pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock during any dividend period if we pay all or a portion of the dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in PIK Shares.\nThe amount available for distribution to holders of Common Stock upon the liquidation and dissolution of our company will be substantially reduced so long as the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding.\nAfter payment of all liabilities and outstanding debt obligations, including the indebtedness under our Loan Facility, holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive $10.00 plus accrued and unpaid dividends prior to the payment of amounts available for distribution to holders of our Common Stock upon the liquidation and dissolution of our company. Consequently, there may not be any funds available to pay holders of our Common Stock upon the liquidation and dissolution of our company as long as the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act permits \"emerging growth companies\" like us to rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are already available to companies having a public float of less than $75 million, for as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company. During that period, we are permitted to omit the auditor's attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Companies with a public float of $75 million or more must otherwise procure such an attestation beginning with their second annual report after their initial public offering. For as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we are also excluded from the requirement to submit \"say-on-pay\", \"say-on-pay frequency\" and \"say-on-parachute\" votes to our stockholders and may avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure compared to larger companies. In addition, as described in the following risk factor, as an emerging growth company we can take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.\nUntil such time as we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs an \"emerging growth company\" we may take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that, as an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Please refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nAt such time as we cease to qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, the costs and demands placed upon management will increase.\nWe will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2018 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under a registration statement under the Securities Act,) (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u2018large accelerated filer\u2019 as defined by the SEC, which would generally occur upon our attaining a public float of at least $700 million. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon management to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements, particularly if our public float should exceed $75 million.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to comply with these requirements.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable market regulators. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline if investors and others lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other applicable regulatory authorities.", "PERMNO": 13976, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "AIRI"}
