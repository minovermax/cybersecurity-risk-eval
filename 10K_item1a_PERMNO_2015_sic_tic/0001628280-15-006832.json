{"cik": "1110647", "company": "OCLARO, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may not be able to ramp the production of our new products to customer required volumes, which could result in delayed or lost revenue.\nMany of our new product samples for metro, data center and long haul 100 and 200 gigahertz (\"GHz\") communication applications have been well received by potential customers of these products. As a result, we anticipate significant backlog for these new generation products. These newer generation products typically will have greater functionality and a smaller footprint, resulting in more complexity in the manufacturing process. This increased complexity will result in lower manufacturing yields or more difficult production to manufacture in volume. If we experience large demand for these products and are unable to manufacture them in sufficient volume, we would fall short of the planned output and revenue targets as we move from low volume sampling to manufacturing for commercial production. In addition, a production ramp for certain products can include a manufacturing transition between two or more locations which carries an inherent risk of delay. For example, we are currently in the process of transitioning the assembly and test processes for our 100 Gb/s CFP2 coherent transceiver from Caswell to our Shenzhen facility and to Venture Corporation Limited (\"Venture\"). Our failure to satisfy our customers' demand for these products could result in our customers postponing or canceling orders or seeking alternative suppliers for these products, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nCustomer requirements for new products are increasingly challenging, which could lead to significant executional risk in designing and manufacturing such products.\nAcross the entire network, our customers are demanding increased performance from our products, at lower prices and in smaller and lower power designs. These requirements stretch the capabilities of our optical chips, packages and electronics to the limit of technical feasibility. In addition these demands are often customer specific, leading to numerous product variations. We enter our new product introduction, or NPI, process with clear performance and cost goals. Because of the complexity of design requirements, executing on these goals is becoming increasingly difficult and less predictable. These difficulties could result in product sampling delays and/or missing targets on key specifications and customer requirements, leading to design losses. Our failure to meet our customers' technical and performance requirements for these products could result in our customers seeking alternative suppliers for these products, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nSales of older legacy products continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues and, if we do not increase the percentage of sales associated with new products, our revenues may not grow in the future or could decline.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by changing technology and continuing process development. The future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our technological capabilities, and our ability to introduce new products that address our customers\u2019 requirements for more cost-effective and higher bandwidth solutions. Our inability to successfully launch or sustain new or next generation programs or product features that anticipate or adequately address future market trends and market transitions in a timely manner could materially adversely affect our revenues and financial results. We may also encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render our products less profitable or obsolete in our chosen markets, and our operating results may suffer. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will introduce new or next generation products in a timely manner, that these products will gain market acceptance, or that new product revenues will increase at a rate sufficient to replace declining legacy product revenues, and failure to do so could materially affect our operating results.\nWe have a history of large operating losses. We may not be able to achieve profitability in the future and as a result we may not be able to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity.\nWe have historically incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of June 27, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,354.2 million. We incurred a loss from continuing operations of $48.2 million and negative cash flows from operations of $46.3 million during the year ended June 27, 2015, and we incurred losses from continuing operations for the years ended June 28, 2014 and June 29, 2013 of $102.1 million and $120.3 million, respectively.\nAs of June 27, 2015, we held $115.1 million in cash and restricted cash, comprised of $111.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 million in restricted cash; and we had working capital, including cash, of $186.7 million. At June 27, 2015, we had debt of $66.0 million, consisting of capital leases and convertible notes payable.\nDuring fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, we executed a number of asset sale and financing transactions in order to generate funds to help sustain our operations: we sold our interleaver and thin film filter business, executed two convertible debt transactions, and executed sales of product lines in order to generate additional capital. On May 6, 2013, we secured a short term loan from Providence Equity of $25.0 million (with net proceeds to us of $20.5 million after discounts and expenses) as a bridge to the conclusion of certain asset sales. In order to obtain the short term loan, we amended our credit agreement to add Providence as a term lender. In connection with this amendment, we agreed to complete certain asset sales and use the proceeds to repay amounts we have borrowed under the credit agreement by July 15, 2013. On August 21, 2013, we amended our credit agreement to extend the time frame within which we must complete such asset sales to make such repayments to September 2, 2013. The corresponding sale of our Zurich Business to II-VI Incorporated (\"II-VI\") was closed on September 12, 2013. We received proceeds of $90.6 million in cash on September 12, 2013 and an additional $2.9 million subject to a potential post-closing working capital adjustment, which was calculated based on the level of working capital in the Oclaro Switzerland GmbH subsidiary at the September 12, 2013 close versus a target based on working capital at June 29, 2013. We also received $1.4 million in January 2015 that had been held back from the purchase price by II-VI. We also received $5.0 million for a 30 day option to sell our Amplifier Business. On November 1, 2013, the sale of our Amplifier Business to II-VI and certain of its affiliates closed and we received $79.6 million in cash from II-VI. We also received $0.9 million in January 2015 that had been held back from the purchase price by II-VI.\nFollowing the sale of the Zurich Business, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement as required, and terminated the Credit Agreement on March 14, 2014. On March 28, 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d) pursuant to which the Bank provided us with a three-year revolving credit facility of up to $40.0 million. Under the Loan Agreement, advances are available based on up to 80 percent of \u201celigible accounts\u201d as defined in the Loan Agreement.\nThe optical communications industry is subject to significant operational fluctuations. In order to remain competitive we incur substantial costs associated with research and development, qualification, production capacity and sales and marketing activities in connection with products that may be purchased, if at all, long after we have incurred such costs. In addition, the rapidly changing industry in which we operate, the length of time between developing and introducing a product to market, frequent changing customer specifications for products, customer cancellations of products and general down cycles in the industry, among other things, make our prospects difficult to evaluate. We are not generating positive cash flow from operations, and it is possible that we may not (i) generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations; (ii) raise funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities; (iii) be able to draw advances under our loan agreement in the future or repay any such amounts; (iv) conclude additional strategic dispositions or similar transactions; or (v) otherwise have sufficient capital resources to meet our future capital or liquidity needs. There are no guarantees we will be able to generate additional financial resources beyond our existing balances.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues and the loss of a major customer could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition.\nHistorically, we have generated most of our revenues from a limited number of customers. Our dependence on a limited number of customers is due to the fact that the optical telecommunications systems industry is dominated by a small number of large companies. These companies in turn depend primarily on a limited number of major telecommunications carrier customers to purchase their products that incorporate our optical components. For example, during the fiscal years ended June 27, 2015, June 28, 2014 and June 29, 2013, our three largest customers accounted for 45 percent, 43 percent and 38 percent of our revenues, respectively. Because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenues, a decrease in demand for our products from any of our major customers for any reason (including due to market conditions, catastrophic events or otherwise) could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. For example, during the second half of fiscal 2012, our revenues were adversely impacted by a significant change in demand expectations from a particular major customer. Further, the industry in which our customers operate is subject to a trend of consolidation. To the extent this trend continues, we may become dependent on even fewer customers to maintain and grow our revenues.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, which could result in lost sales and lower revenues.\nThe market for optical components and modules is highly competitive and this competition could result in our existing customers moving their orders to our competitors. We are aware of a number of companies that have developed or are developing optical component products, including tunable lasers, pluggable components, modulators and subsystems, among others, that compete directly with our current and proposed product offerings.\nCertain of our competitors may be able to more quickly and effectively:\n\u2022\ndevelop or respond to new technologies or technical standards;\n\u2022\nreact to changing customer requirements and expectations;\n\u2022\ndevote needed resources to the development, production, promotion and sale of products;\n\u2022\nattain high manufacturing yields on new product designs; and\n\u2022\ndeliver competitive products at lower prices.\nSome of our current competitors, as well as some of our potential competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, market leaders in industries such as semiconductor and data communications, who may also have significantly more resources than we do, may in the future enter our market with competing products. Our competitors and new Chinese companies are establishing manufacturing operations in China to take advantage of comparatively low manufacturing costs. All of these risks may be increased if the market were to further consolidate through mergers or other business combinations between our competitors.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors and aggressive competition in the market may result in lower prices for our products and/or decreased gross margins. Any such development could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain or improve gross margin levels.\nWe may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margins, due to slow introductions of new products, pricing pressure from increased competition, the failure to effectively reduce the cost of existing products, the failure to improve our product mix, the potential for future macroeconomic or market volatility reducing sales volumes, changes in customer demand (including a change in product mix between different areas of our business) or other factors. Our gross margins can also be adversely impacted for reasons including, but not limited to, fixed manufacturing costs that would not be expected to decrease in proportion to any decrease in revenues; unfavorable production yields or variances; increases in costs of input parts and materials; the timing of movements in our inventory balances; warranty costs and related returns; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and possible exposure to inventory valuation reserves. Any failure to maintain, or improve, our gross margins will adversely affect our financial results, including our goals to achieve profitability and achieve sustainable cash flow from operations.\nThe majority of our long-term customer contracts do not commit customers to specified buying levels, and our customers may decrease, cancel or delay their buying levels at any time with little or no advance notice to us.\nThe majority of our customers typically purchase our products pursuant to individual purchase orders or contracts that do not contain purchase commitments. Some customers provide us with their expected forecasts for our products several months in advance, but these customers may decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place, and the impact of any such actions may be intensified given our dependence on a small number of large customers. If any of our major customers decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, our business and results of operations would be harmed. Cancellation or delays of such orders may cause us to fail to achieve our short-term and long-term financial and operating goals and result in excess and obsolete inventory.\nAs a result of our global operations, our business is subject to currency fluctuations that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur financial results have been and will continue to be materially impacted by foreign currency fluctuations. At certain times in our history, declines in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the U.K. pound sterling and the Japanese yen have had a major negative effect on our margins and our cash flow. A significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.K. pounds sterling and Japanese yen and substantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between these currencies and, to a lesser extent, other currencies in which we collect revenues and/or pay expenses could have a material effect on our future operating results. For example during fiscal 2015, the Japanese yen depreciated approximately 22 percent relative to the U.S. dollar, impacting our manufacturing overhead and operating expenses. If the U.S. dollar stays the same or depreciates relative to the U.K. pound sterling and/or Japanese yen in the future, our future operating results may be materially impacted. Additional exposure could also result should the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan or the Euro vary more significantly than they have to date.\nWe periodically engage in currency hedging transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to U.S. dollar to U.K. pound sterling and Japanese Yen currency fluctuations, and we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations. These transactions may not operate to fully hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations, and under certain circumstances, these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may experience low manufacturing yields.\nManufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the volume of production due to customer demand and the nature and extent of changes in specifications required by customers for which we perform design-in work. Higher volumes due to demand for a fixed, rather than continually changing, design generally results in higher manufacturing yields, whereas lower volume production generally results in lower yields. In addition, lower yields may result, and have in the past resulted, from commercial shipments of products prior to full manufacturing qualification to the applicable specifications. Changes in manufacturing processes required as a result of changes in product specifications, changing customer needs, introduction of new product lines and changes in contract manufacturers have historically caused, and may in the future cause, significantly reduced manufacturing yields, resulting in low or negative margins on those products. Moreover, an increase in the rejection rate of products during the quality control process, before, during or after manufacture, results in lower yields and margins. Finally, manufacturing yields and margins can also be lower if we receive or inadvertently use defective or contaminated materials from our suppliers. Any reduction in our manufacturing yields will adversely affect our gross margins and could have a material impact on our operating results.\nIn order to remain competitive, we have been in the past and may be in the future required to agree to customer terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nMany of our customers have significant purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested more favorable terms and conditions, including extended payment terms, than we typically provide. In order for us to remain competitive, we may be required to accommodate these requests, which may include granting terms that affect the timing of our receipt of cash. As a result, these more favorable customer terms may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recently announced significant changes at Oclaro relating to our operations, strategic plan and management team. The operation of our business could be adversely affected by the transition of key personnel as we rebuild our executive leadership team and make additional organizational changes.\nBeginning in June 2013, we have announced a series of events, transactions and restructuring plans, which have had a significant impact on our business. Among other things, we sold our Komoro, Zurich and Amplifier Businesses and announced a restructuring plan to focus our business on our core competencies. While we believe these events, transactions and plans will\nhave a positive impact on our financial condition and results of operations, these changes will result in at least a significant near-term reduction in our revenues, could lead to a disruption in our operations and employee morale, could lead to unplanned attrition of employees, and adversely affect our ability to attract highly skilled employees. In addition, many of our senior management are relatively new. Since June 2013, we have appointed a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and have hired a new Chief Commercial Officer, a new General Counsel, a new Principal Accounting Officer, a new Executive Vice President of Human Resources and a new President of our Integrated Photonics Division, who is currently in the process of transitioning his role to become our Chief Scientist. We have also decreased the size of our Board of Directors from nine to seven. It is important to our success that our Chief Executive Officer continues building an effective management team and global organization. It may take some time for each of the new members of our management team to become fully integrated into our business. Our failure to manage these transitions, or to find and retain experienced management personnel, could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our operating results. If we experience these or other adverse consequences, fail to manage these transitions, do not find and retain experienced management personnel, or are otherwise unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plan, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to continue as a going concern over the long term.\nDelays, disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our business.\nWe may experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or the manufacturing operations of our subcontractors. As a result, we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross margins, and our product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenues, competitive position and reputation. Furthermore, even if we are able to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, we may be unable to recognize revenues at the time of delivery based on our revenue recognition policies.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers and key contract manufacturers who could disrupt our business if they stopped, decreased, delayed or were unable to meet our demand for shipments of their products or manufacturing of our products.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers of raw materials and equipment used to manufacture our products. We currently also depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers, principally Fabrinet in Thailand and Venture in Malaysia, to manufacture certain of our products. Some of these suppliers are sole sources. We typically have not entered into long-term agreements with our suppliers other than Fabrinet and Venture. As a result, these suppliers generally may stop supplying us materials and equipment at any time. Our reliance on a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers could result in delivery problems, reduced control over product pricing and quality, and an inability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner. Some of our suppliers that may be small or under-capitalized may experience financial difficulties that could prevent them from supplying us materials and equipment. In addition, our suppliers, including our sole source suppliers, may experience manufacturing delays or shut downs due to circumstances beyond their control such as earthquakes, floods, fires, labor unrest, political unrest or other natural disasters.\nFabrinet\u2019s manufacturing operations are located in Thailand. In October 2011, due to flooding in Thailand, Fabrinet suspended operations at both of its factories that supply us with finished goods. Thailand has also been subject to political unrest in the past, including the temporary interruption of service at one of its international airports, and has again begun to experience political unrest. If Fabrinet is unable to supply us with materials or equipment, or if it is unable to ship our materials or equipment out of Thailand due to future flooding or political unrest, this could materially adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations.\nAny supply deficiencies relating to the quality or quantities of materials or equipment we use to manufacture our products could materially and adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations. Lead times for the purchase of certain materials and equipment from suppliers have increased and in some cases have limited our ability to rapidly respond to increased demand, and may continue to do so in the future. To the extent we introduce additional contract manufacturing partners, introduce new products with new partners and/or move existing internal or external production lines to new partners, we could experience supply disruptions during the transition process. In addition, due to our customers\u2019 requirements relating to the qualification of our suppliers and contract manufacturing facilities and operations, we cannot quickly enter into alternative supplier relationships, which prevents us from being able to respond immediately to adverse events affecting our suppliers.\nIf our customers do not qualify our manufacturing lines or the manufacturing lines of our subcontractors for volume shipments, our operating results could suffer.\nMost of our customers do not purchase products, other than limited numbers of evaluation units, prior to qualification of the manufacturing line for volume production. Our existing manufacturing lines, as well as each new manufacturing line, must pass through varying levels of qualification with our customers. Our manufacturing lines have passed our qualification standards, as well as our technical standards. However, our customers also require that our manufacturing lines pass their specific qualification standards and that we, and any subcontractors that we may use, be registered under international quality standards. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, encounter quality control issues as a result of relocating our manufacturing lines or introducing new products to fill production. We may be unable to obtain customer qualification of our manufacturing lines or we may experience delays in obtaining customer qualification of our manufacturing lines. Such delays or failure to obtain qualifications would harm our operating results and customer relationships. If we introduce new contract manufacturing partners and move any production lines from existing internal or external facilities, the new production lines will likely need to be re-qualified with our customers.\nOur results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory, and we may continue to incur inventory-related charges.\nWe need to manage our inventory of component parts and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements. Accurately forecasting customers\u2019 product needs is difficult. Some of our products and supplies have in the past, and may in the future, become obsolete or be deemed excess while in inventory due to rapidly changing customer specifications or a decrease in customer demand. For example, following our acquisition of Opnext in July 2012, we reviewed the inventory we acquired from Opnext in the acquisition and, when we added that Opnext inventory to our preexisting inventory, we reduced the value of the Opnext inventory on our balance sheet by approximately $43.5 million (compared to its value on Opnext\u2019s financial records as of the closing of the acquisition) to reflect our review. This reduced value was reflected in the inventory we reported in our financial statements for the quarter ended September 29, 2012. We also have exposure to contractual liabilities to our contract manufacturers for inventories purchased by them on our behalf, based on our forecasted requirements, which may become excess or obsolete. Our inventory balances also represent an investment of cash. To the extent our inventory turns are slower than we anticipate based on historical practice, our cash conversion cycle extends and more of our cash remains invested in working capital. If we are not able to manage our inventory effectively, we may need to write down the value of some of our existing inventory or write off non-saleable or obsolete inventory. We have from time to time incurred significant inventory-related charges. Any such charges we incur in future periods could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our cash flow.\nWe have a large amount of intercompany balances with our China entities which may be subject to taxes and penalties when we try to pay them down or collect them.\nPayments for goods and services into and out of China are subject to numerous and over-lapping government regulation with respect to foreign exchange controls, banking controls, import and export controls, and taxes. We have been operating in China for an extended period of time and have accumulated significant intercompany balances with our related entities. Our ability to repay or collect these balances may be restricted by Chinese laws and, as a result, we may be unable to successfully pay down or collect on these balances. As a consequence, we may be assessed additional taxes in China if we are unable to claim bad debt deductions or incur debt forgiveness income from the cancellation of these intercompany balances. Additionally, if we are found not to have complied with the various local laws surrounding cross border payments, we may incur penalties and fines for non-compliance. Any such taxes, penalties and/or fines could be significant in amount and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, including our cash and cash equivalent balances.\nOur business and results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted by general economic, financial market conditions and market conditions in the industries in which we operate, and such conditions may increase the other risks that affect our business.\nOver the past few years, the world\u2019s financial markets have experienced significant turmoil, resulting in reductions in available credit, increased costs of credit, extreme volatility in security prices, potential changes to existing credit terms, and rating downgrades of investments. In light of these economic conditions, many of our customers reduced their spending plans, leading them to draw down their existing inventory and reduce orders for our products. It is possible that current economic conditions, including recent developments in China, could result in further setbacks, and that some of our customers could as a result significantly reduce their capital expenditures, draw down their inventories, reduce production levels of existing products, defer introduction of new products or place orders and accept delivery for products for which they do not pay us due to their economic difficulties or other reasons. In the past, these conditions have materially and adversely affected the market conditions in the industries in which we operate, and have had a material adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, the\nfinancial downturn affected the financial strength of certain of our customers, including their ability to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products, and could adversely affect additional customers in the future. Our suppliers may also be adversely affected by economic conditions that may impact their ability to provide important components used in our manufacturing processes on a timely basis, or at all. To a large degree, orders from our customers are dependent on demand from telecom carriers around the world. Telecom carrier capital expenditure plans and execution can also be adversely impacted, both in terms of total spend and in determination of areas of investment within network infrastructures, by global and regional macroeconomic conditions.\nThese conditions could also result in reduced capital resources because of the potential lack of credit availability, higher costs of credit and the stretching of payables by creditors seeking to preserve their own cash resources. We are unable to predict the likely duration, severity and potential continuation of any disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries, but the longer the duration the greater the risks we face in operating our business.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for highly skilled technical personnel is extremely intense and we continue to face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified engineers in many areas of our business. We may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Our future success also depends on the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key management and technical personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of services of these or other executive officers or key personnel or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the future we may need to access the capital markets to raise additional equity, which could dilute our shareholder base.\nWe may need additional liquidity beyond our current expectations, such as to fund future growth, strengthen our balance sheet or to fund the cost of restructuring activities, and will continue to explore other sources of additional liquidity. These additional sources of liquidity could include one, or a combination, of the following: (i) issuing equity securities, (ii) incurring indebtedness secured by our assets, (iii) issuing debt and/or convertible debt securities, or (iv) selling product lines, other assets and/or portions of our business. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf we raise funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of securities held by existing stockholders. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt instruments, such as we did in February 2015 when we issued convertible notes and December 2012 when we issued exchangeable bonds, the agreements governing such debt instruments may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments or acquisitions; (iv) enter into transactions with our affiliates; (v) sell certain assets; (vi) redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments; (vii) declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders; and (viii) merge or consolidate with any entity. (See Note 7, Credit Line and Notes, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details). The exchangeable bonds issued in 2012 were subsequently exchanged for common stock. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, develop or enhance our products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures and operate effectively could be significantly limited.\nWe may have to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to operate our business.\nIn the future, we may incur additional indebtedness through arrangements such as credit agreements or term loans that may impose restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to respond appropriately to market conditions, make capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities. In addition, any debt arrangements we may enter into would likely require us to make regular interest payments, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may undertake acquisitions or mergers, that do not prove successful, which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we consider acquisitions or mergers, collectively referred to as \u201cacquisitions,\u201d of other businesses, assets or companies that would complement our current product offerings, enhance our intellectual property rights or offer other competitive opportunities. For example, on March 26, 2012, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with Opnext, which was completed on July 23, 2012. However, in the future, we may not be able to identify\nsuitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider appropriate. In addition, we are in an industry that is actively consolidating and, as a result, there is no guarantee that we will successfully and satisfactorily bid against third parties, including competitors, when we identify a critical target we want to acquire.\nWe cannot readily predict the timing or size of our future acquisitions, or the success of our recent or future acquisitions. Failure to successfully implement our future acquisition plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Even successful acquisitions could have the effect of reducing our cash balances, diluting the ownership interests of existing stockholders or increasing our indebtedness. For example, in our acquisition of Opnext we issued approximately 38.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of Opnext.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Xtellus, Inc. (\"Xtellus\") in 2009, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we issued 0.9 million shares of our common stock related to the settlement of our Xtellus escrow liability. In October 2011, we paid $0.5 million in cash and issued 0.8 million shares of our common stock to pay earnout obligations related to our acquisition of Mintera Corporation (\"Mintera\"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we paid $2.2 million to settle a portion of our Mintera earnout obligations, and settled the remaining $8.6 million obligation in cash in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.\nAll acquisitions involve potential risks and uncertainties, including the following, any of which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations:\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nincreased costs associated with merged or acquired operations;\n\u2022\nincreased indebtedness obligations;\n\u2022\neconomic dilution to gross and operating profit (loss) and earnings (loss) per share;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the combined, acquired or remaining technology, which could, among other things, result in the impairment of amounts recorded as goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and liabilities and unforeseen accounting charges;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating product offerings;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products and technologies with reduced cost;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in coordinating and integrating the manufacturing activities, including with respect to third-party manufacturers, including coordination, integration or transfers of any manufacturing activities associated with our acquisition of Opnext in 2012;\n\u2022\ndelays and difficulties in delivery of products and services;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively integrate or separate management information systems, personnel, research and development, marketing, sales and support operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining internal control procedures and disclosure controls that comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or poor integration of a target\u2019s procedures and controls;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in preserving important relationships of our acquired businesses and resolving potential conflicts between business cultures;\n\u2022\nuncertainty on the part of our existing customers, or the customers of an acquired company, about our ability to operate effectively after a transaction, and the potential loss of such customers;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in coordinating the international activities of our acquired businesses, including Opnext, which has substantial operations in Japan as well as the United States, and which uses contract manufacturing suppliers in Southeast Asia;\n\u2022\nthe effect of tax laws and other legal and regulatory regimes due to increasing complexities of our global operating structure;\n\u2022\ngreater exposure to the impact of foreign currency changes on our business;\n\u2022\nthe effect of employment law or regulations or other limitations in foreign jurisdictions that could have an impact on timing, amounts or costs of achieving expected synergies; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial demands on our management as a result of these transactions that may limit their time to attend to other operational, financial, business and strategic issues.\nOur integration with acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate these businesses in a timely manner, or at all, or that any of the anticipated benefits from our previous or future acquisitions will be realized. There are inherent challenges in integrating the operations of geographically diverse companies. We may have difficulty, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to, integrating management and personnel from our acquisitions. Our failure to achieve the strategic objectives of our past and future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses and our other operating results and cash resources, and could result in us not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of these transactions. In addition, we cannot assure you that the growth rate of the combined company will equal the historical growth rate experienced by any of the companies that we have acquired. Comparable risks would accompany any divestiture of businesses or assets we might undertake.\nIn addition, even if we successfully integrate the operations of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future, we cannot predict with certainty which strategic, financial or operating synergies or other benefits, if any, will actually be achieved from our acquisition, the timing of any such benefits, or whether those benefits which have been achieved will be sustainable on a long-term basis. Our failure to successfully integrate the operations of companies that we acquire would likely have a material and adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a complex multinational tax structure, and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nWe have a complex multinational tax structure with multiple types of intercompany transactions, and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing agreements is subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are also subject to periodic examination of our income tax returns and related transfer pricing documentation by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected.\nOur future success will depend, in large part, upon our intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, design rights, trade secrets, trademarks and know-how. We maintain an active program of identifying technology appropriate for patent protection. Our practice is to require employees and consultants to execute non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements upon commencement of employment or consulting arrangements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individuals during their work for us and require that all proprietary information disclosed will remain confidential. Although such agreements may be binding, they may not be enforceable in full or in part in all jurisdictions and any breach of a confidentiality obligation could have a negative effect on our business and our remedy for such breach may be limited.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is an important corporate asset. The steps we have taken and may take in the future to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not successfully challenge the validity of our patents or design products that avoid infringement of our proprietary rights with respect to our technology. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other similar technologies, that any patents will be issued from any application pending or filed by us, or that, if patents are issued, that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights under those patents will provide a competitive advantage to us or that our products and technology will be adequately covered by our patents and other intellectual property. Further, the laws of certain regions in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including Asia-Pacific, Southeast Asia and Latin America, may not be enforceable to protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom and continental European countries. This is especially relevant since we have transferred our assembly and test operations and chip-on-carrier operations, including certain engineering-related functions, to Shenzhen, China, and have recently completed the transition of portions of these assembly and test operations to Venture in Malaysia.\nOpnext historically relied on Hitachi, one of our major shareholders, for assistance with the research and development efforts related to Opnext\u2019s product portfolio. Any failure of Hitachi to continue to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our business. Opnext\u2019s product expertise is based on the research ability developed within their Hitachi heritage and\nthrough joint research and development in lasers and optical technologies. A key factor to Opnext\u2019s business success and strategy is fundamental laser research. Opnext relied on access to Hitachi\u2019s research laboratories pursuant to a research and development agreement with Hitachi, which includes access to Hitachi\u2019s research facilities and engineers, to conduct research and development activities that are important to the establishment of new technologies and products vital to their current and future business. Should access to Hitachi\u2019s research laboratories become unavailable or available at less attractive terms in the future, this may impede development of new technologies and products, and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly as a result of factors that are outside our control.\nOur revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of factors that are outside our control. The timing of order placement, size of orders and satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria, changes in the pricing of our products due to competitive pressures as well as order or shipment delays or deferrals, with respect to our products, may cause material fluctuations in revenues. Our lengthy sales cycle, which may extend to more than one year, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary from period to period and it may be difficult to predict the timing and amount of any variation. Delays or deferrals in purchasing decisions by our customers may increase as we develop new or enhanced products for new markets, including data communications, industrial, research, consumer and biotechnology markets. Purchase decisions by our customers are also impacted by the capital expenditure plans of the global telecom carriers, which tend to be the primary customers of our customers. Our current and anticipated future dependence on a small number of customers increases the revenue impact of each such customer\u2019s decision to delay or defer purchases from us, or decision not to purchase products from us. For example, during the second half of fiscal 2012, our revenues were adversely impacted by a significant change in demand expectations from a particular major customer. Our expense levels in the future will be based, in large part, on our expectations regarding future revenue sources and, as a result, operating results for any quarterly period in which material orders fail to occur, or are delayed or deferred, could vary significantly. Because our business is capital intensive, significant fluctuations in our revenues, without a corresponding decrease in expenses, can have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe have significant operations in China, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in China.\nA significant portion of our assembly and test operations, chip-on-carrier operations and manufacturing and supply chain management operations are concentrated in our facility in Shenzhen, China. In addition, we have research and development related activities in Shenzhen, China. To be successful in China we will need to:\n\u2022\nqualify our manufacturing lines and the products we produce in Shenzhen, as required by our customers; and\n\u2022\nattract and retain qualified personnel to operate our Shenzhen facility.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve these objectives.\nEmployee turnover in China is high due to the intensely competitive and fluid market for skilled labor. To operate our Shenzhen facility under these conditions, we need to continue to hire direct manufacturing personnel, administrative personnel and technical personnel; obtain and retain required legal authorization to hire such personnel; and incur the time and expense to hire and train such personnel. On March 28, 2012, shortly after announcing our agreement with Venture to transition certain manufacturing operations, certain of our employees in Shenzhen initiated a work stoppage. The work stoppage impacted our Shenzhen manufacturing capabilities temporarily up to and including April 4, 2012. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2012 were adversely impacted by approximately $4.0 million due to the work stoppage.\nInflation rates in China are higher than in most jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe that salary inflation rates for the skilled personnel we hire and seek to retain in Shenzhen are likely to be higher than overall inflation rates.\nOperations in China are subject to greater political, legal and economic risks than our operations in other countries. In particular, the political, legal and economic climate in China, both nationally and regionally, is fluid and unpredictable. For example, we have been subject to commercial litigation in China initiated by a former supplier. For a description of this lawsuit, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, \"Raysung Commercial Litigation,\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations such as those related to, among other things, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, intellectual property, currency controls, employee benefits and other matters. In addition, we may not obtain or retain the requisite legal permits to continue to operate in China, and costs or operational limitations may be imposed in connection with obtaining and complying with such permits.\nWe intend to continue to export the products manufactured at our Shenzhen facility. Under current regulations, upon application and approval by the relevant governmental authorities, we will not be subject to certain Chinese taxes and will be exempt from certain duties on imported materials that are used in the manufacturing process and subsequently exported from China as\nfinished products. However, Chinese trade regulations are in a state of flux, and we may become subject to other forms of taxation and duties in China or may be required to pay export fees in the future. In the event that we become subject to new forms of taxation or export fees in China, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We may also be required to expend greater amounts than we currently anticipate in connection with increasing production at our Shenzhen facility. Any one of the factors cited above, or a combination of them, could result in unanticipated costs or interruptions in production, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could result in expensive litigation or require us to obtain a license to use the technology from third parties, or we may be prohibited from selling certain products in the future.\nCompanies in the industry in which we operate frequently are sued or receive informal claims of patent infringement or infringement of other intellectual property rights. We have, from time to time, received such claims, including from competitors and from companies that have substantially more resources than us. For example, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, \"Furukawa Patent Litigation,\" in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThird parties may in the future assert claims against us concerning our existing products or with respect to future products under development, or with respect to products that we may acquire through acquisitions. We have entered into and may in the future enter into indemnification obligations in favor of some customers that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding that we are infringing other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. If we do infringe a third party\u2019s rights, we may need to negotiate with holders of those rights in order to obtain a license to those rights or otherwise settle any infringement claim. We have from time to time received notices from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property and where appropriate have entered into license agreements with those third parties with respect to that intellectual property. Any license agreements that we wish to enter into the future with respect to intellectual property rights may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not in all cases be able to resolve allegations of infringement through licensing arrangements, settlement, alternative designs or otherwise. We may take legal action to determine the validity and scope of the third-party rights or to defend against any allegations of infringement. Holders of intellectual property rights could become more aggressive in alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights and we may be the subject of such claims asserted by a third party. In the course of pursuing any of these means or defending against any lawsuits filed against us, we could incur significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention. Due to the competitive nature of our industry, it is unlikely that we could increase our prices to cover such costs. In addition, such claims could result in significant penalties or injunctions that could prevent us from selling some of our products in certain markets or result in settlements or judgments that require payment of significant royalties or damages.\nFluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur revenues and other operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. The timing of order placement, size of orders and satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria, changes in the pricing of our products due to competitive pressures as well as order or shipment delays or deferrals, with respect to our products, acquisitions and asset sales may cause material fluctuations in revenues. Our lengthy sales cycle, which may extend to more than one year, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary from period to period and it may be difficult to predict the timing and amount of any variation. Delays or deferrals in purchasing decisions by our customers may increase as we develop new or enhanced products for new markets, including data communications, industrial, research, consumer and biotechnology markets. Our current and anticipated future dependence on a small number of customers increases the revenue impact of each such customer\u2019s decision to delay or defer purchases from us, or decision not to purchase products from us. Our expense levels in the future will be based, in large part, on our expectations regarding future revenue sources and, as a result, operating results for any quarterly period in which material orders fail to occur, or are delayed or deferred, could vary significantly.\nBecause of these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be indicative of our future performance. In future periods, our results of operations may differ, in some cases materially, from the estimates of public market analysts and investors. Such a discrepancy, or our failure to meet published financial projections, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf we fail to obtain the right to use the intellectual property rights of others necessary to operate our business, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain companies in the telecommunications and optical components markets in which we sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous patents in these industries are held by others, including academic institutions and our competitors. Optical component suppliers may seek to gain a competitive advantage or other third parties, inside or outside our market, may seek an economic return on their intellectual property portfolios by making infringement claims against us. We currently in-license certain intellectual property of third parties, and in\nthe future, we may need to obtain license rights to patents or other intellectual property held by others to the extent necessary for our business. Unless we are able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, patents or other intellectual property held by others could be used to inhibit or prohibit our production and sale of existing products and our development of new products for our markets. Licenses granting us the right to use third-party technology may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Generally, a license, if granted, would include payments of up-front fees, ongoing royalties or both. These payments or other terms could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. In addition, in the event we are granted such a license, it is likely such license would be non-exclusive and other parties, including competitors, may be able to utilize such technology. Our larger competitors may be able to obtain licenses or cross-license their technology on better terms than we can, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our larger competitors may be able to buy such technology and preclude us from licensing or using such technology.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues internationally and therefore are subject to additional risks associated with the extent of our international operations.\nFor fiscal years ended June 27, 2015, June 28, 2014 and June 29, 2013, 16 percent, 11 percent and 9 percent of our revenues, respectively, were derived from sales to customers located in the United States and 84 percent, 89 percent and 91 percent of our revenues, respectively, were derived from sales to customers located outside the United States. We are subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing or adequately protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nability to hire qualified candidates;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes;\n\u2022\npolitical, legal and economic instability in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nforeign regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, including restrictions imposed by the United States government on trading with parties in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays;\n\u2022\nepidemics and illnesses;\n\u2022\nterrorism and threats of terrorism;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and infrastructure problems due to adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages related to employee dissatisfaction;\n\u2022\nchanges in import/export regulations, tariffs, and freight rates; and\n\u2022\nthe effective protections of, and the ability to enforce, contractual arrangements.\nAny of these risks, or any other risks related to our foreign operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face product liability claims.\nDespite quality assurance measures, defects may occur in our products. The occurrence of any defects in our products could give rise to liability for damages caused by such defects, including consequential damages. Such defects could, moreover, impair market acceptance of our products. Both could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, we may assume product warranty liabilities related to companies we acquire, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In order to mitigate the risk of liability for damages, we carry product liability insurance with a $25.0 million aggregate annual limit and errors and omissions insurance with a $5.0 million annual limit. We cannot assure you that this insurance would adequately cover our costs arising from any defects in our products or otherwise.\nAt times, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. For example, between June 29, 2014 and June 27, 2015, the market price of our common stock ranged from a low of $1.31 per share to a high of $2.85 per share. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall.\nIn addition to the matters discussed in other risk factors included in our public filings, some of the events that could impact our stock price are:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations, including our gross margins and cash flow;\n\u2022\nchanges in our business, operations or prospects;\n\u2022\nhiring or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nnew contractual relationships with key suppliers or customers by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nproposed acquisitions and dispositions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfinancial results or projections that fail to meet public market analysts\u2019 expectations and changes in stock market analysts\u2019 recommendations regarding us, other optical technology companies or the telecommunication industry in general;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for common stock;\n\u2022\nadverse judgments or settlements obligating us to pay damages;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of common stock in connection with acquisitions or other transactions;\n\u2022\nacts of war, terrorism, or natural disasters;\n\u2022\nindustry, domestic and international market and economic conditions, including sovereign debt issues in certain parts of the world and related global macroeconomic issues;\n\u2022\nlow trading volume in our stock;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to patents or property rights; and\n\u2022\ngovernment regulatory changes.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Xtellus, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 we issued 0.9 million shares of our common stock to settle our escrow liability. In connection with our acquisition of Mintera, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, we issued 0.8 million shares of our common stock to pay portions of the 12 month earnout obligations. In connection with our acquisition of Opnext, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we issued 38.4 million shares of our common stock. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, we issued 13.5 million shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of the convertible notes issued in December, 2012. We also have $65 million of convertible notes outstanding, which if converted, would result in us issuing up to 44.5 million shares of our common stock. In May 2013, we also issued 1.8 million warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share in connection with the Term Loan we received in May 2013 (See Note 7, Credit Line and Notes, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details). On May 2, 2014, these warrants were exercised, resulting in the issuance of 978,457 shares of our common stock. The issuance of these shares and their subsequent sale will dilute our existing stockholders and could potentially have a negative impact on our stock price.\nOur shares of common stock have experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations, in many cases without any direct relationship to our operating performance. An outgrowth of this market volatility is the significant vulnerability of our stock price to any actual or perceived fluctuation in the strength of the markets we serve, regardless of the actual consequence of such fluctuations. As a result, the market price for our stock is highly volatile. These broad market and industry factors have caused the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, and may in the future cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock. Issuances of shares of our common stock or convertible securities, including outstanding options and warrants, will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders.\nA lack of effective internal controls over our financial reporting could result in an inability to report our financial results accurately, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nIn fiscal year 2013, in connection with establishing the fair values of certain assets and liabilities associated with our acquisition of Opnext, we identified a material weakness over controls related to our recording of the purchase under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, we made adjustments to the fair value of certain items, including property and equipment, capital leases and intangible assets. As a result of these adjustments, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as of June 29, 2013, because the potential impact of these adjustments could have been material to our financial position and results of operations. During the year ended June 28, 2014, we hired new finance personnel and added oversight for the accounting of acquisitions and dispositions. Our remediation efforts, including the testing of these controls, continued throughout fiscal year 2014. This material weakness was considered remediated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, once these controls were shown to be operational for a sufficient period of time to allow management to conclude that these controls were operating effectively.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we also identified control deficiencies relating to inventory and property and equipment, which in the aggregate constituted a material weakness. We determined that our processes, procedures and controls related to the review and analysis of inventory and property and equipment were not effective to ensure that certain amounts related to these financial statement accounts were accurately reported in a timely manner. As a result of these adjustments, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as of June 28, 2014. Our remediation efforts, including the testing of these controls, continued throughout fiscal year 2015. This material weakness was considered remediated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, once these controls were shown to be operational for a sufficient period of time to allow management to conclude that these controls were operating effectively.\nIn addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, acquire companies that have either experienced material weaknesses in their internal controls over financial reporting or have had no previous reporting obligations under Sarbanes-Oxley. Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our internal controls over financial reporting could cause those controls to fail.\nWe cannot assure you that similar material weaknesses will not recur in the future. If additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. This, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and our stock price, and we could be subject to stockholder litigation and our common stock may be delisted as a result. Even if we are able to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the costs of doing business may increase and our management may be required to dedicate greater time and resources to that effort.\nWe have been named as a party to derivative action lawsuits in the past, and we may be named in additional litigation in the future, all of which would require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and could result in an unfavorable outcome which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhen the market price of a stock experiences a sharp decline, as has happened to us in the past, holders of that stock have often brought securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Several securities class action lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. Other class action lawsuits have been initiated in the past against Opnext, us and certain of our respective current and former officers and directors as purported derivative actions. The securities class action complaints alleged violations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each purported derivative complaint alleged, among other things, counts for breaches of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment. The courts approved the settlement of these lawsuits and the settlements became final in December 2014. For a description of these lawsuits, see Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, \"Class Action and Derivative Litigation\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on February 5, 2015. If new litigation of this type were to be initiated in the future, such litigation would likely divert the time and attention of our management and could cause us to incur significant expense in defending against the litigation. In addition, if any such suits were resolved in a manner adverse to us, the damages we could be required to pay may be substantial and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and our ability to operate our business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits, along with various other anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We have manufacturing operations in China and other jurisdictions, many of which pose elevated risks of anti-corruption violations, and we export our products for sale internationally. This puts us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered \u201cforeign officials\u201d under the FCPA, resulting in an elevated risk of potential FCPA violations. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sold our Komoro, Zurich and Amplifier Businesses and may pursue other strategic dispositions or a further reduction in the number of our locations which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or further change our business profile significantly.\nThe sale of our Komoro Business in 2014, the sale of our Zurich and Amplifier Businesses in 2013, and any future strategic disposition of assets or businesses or reduction in the number of our locations, each involve numerous risks. These risks include: (i) potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; (ii) difficulty segregating assets or businesses to be disposed of or consolidated; (iii) exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the disposition; (iv) changing our business profile in ways that could have unintended negative consequences; (v) the failure to achieve anticipated benefits; (vi) accounting charges that may affect our financial condition and results of operations; (vii) significant fluctuations in our revenues and operating results; (viii) our ability to support manufacturing services and transition services and the risk to the rest of our business resulting from resources focusing on those services. These asset sales contributed to a decrease in our total revenues during 2014 compared to 2013, and a further decrease of revenues during 2015 compared to 2014. These decreases have and may continue to adversely impact our operating results. Additional asset sales that we may consider in the future could cause us to face similar risks, which could weaken our financial condition and adversely impact our operating results.\nIn the future we may incur significant additional restructuring charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have previously enacted a series of restructuring plans and cost reduction plans designed to reduce our manufacturing overhead and our operating expenses that have resulted in significant restructuring charges.\nFor instance, during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, we incurred $2.5 million and $3.5 million in restructuring charges, respectively, in connection with the transition of certain portions of our Shenzhen, China assembly and test operations to Venture. In addition, during the year ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014, we also incurred $4.0 million and $13.2 million in restructuring charges in connection with the restructuring plan we initiated in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 to simplify our operating footprint, reduce our cost structure and focus our research and development investment in the optical communications market where we can leverage our core competencies.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not incur additional restructuring charges. Significant additional restructuring charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results in the periods that they are incurred and recognized. In addition, such charges could require significant cash commitments that may adversely affect our cash balances.\nWe may undertake divestitures of portions of our business, such as the divestiture of our Komoro Business, Zurich Business and our Amplifier Business, that require us to continue providing substantial post-divestiture transition services and support, which may cause us to incur unanticipated costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we consider divestitures of product lines or portions of our assets in order to streamline our business, focus on our core operations and raise cash. For example, on October 27, 2014, we sold our Komoro Business to Ushio Opto Semiconductors, Inc. (\"Ushio\"). In addition, on September 12, 2013, we sold our Zurich Business to II-VI and on November 1, 2013, we sold our Amplifier Business to II-VI (See Note 3, Business Combinations and Dispositions, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details). In connection with these divestitures, we entered into transition service, manufacturing service and supply agreements with both Ushio and II-VI to facilitate the ownership transition, collectively referred to as \u201ctransition agreements.\u201d Pursuant to these transition agreements, we continue to manufacture certain products for II-VI and perform limited administrative functions for Ushio. From time to time, substantial amounts of executive resources have been diverted from our core ongoing business to manage these transitions. For each of these divestitures, a material portion of the purchase price was held back to address post-closing claims, including claims related to our performance of the transition agreements. We received a portion of the hold-back from the sale of the Zurich Business during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. We expected to receive an additional $10.0 million which was subject to hold-back by II-VI until December 31, 2014 to address any post-closing adjustments or claims related to the sale of the Zurich and Amplifier Businesses. On December 30, 2014, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with II-VI and II-VI Holdings B.V. regarding disposition of the amounts held back by the II-VI parties. Of the $10.0 million subject to hold-back until December 31, 2014, we received $2.35 million in January 2015 and we released the remaining $7.65 million to II-VI Holdings B.V. In order to perform under these transition agreements, we have been required to continue operating certain facilities, dedicate certain manufacturing capacity and maintain certain supplier agreements that have added additional costs and delayed our ability to fully restructure our operations to efficiently focus on our core ongoing business. If we fail to perform under any of these transition agreements, or if we do not successfully execute the restructuring of our operations after our transition agreement obligations have been fulfilled, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nLitigation may substantially increase our costs and harm our business.\nWe are a party to numerous lawsuits and will continue to incur legal fees and other costs related thereto, including potentially expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of officers and directors under indemnification obligations. The expense of continuing to defend such litigation may be significant. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any defense. Further, the amount of time that will be required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and these actions may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters that may arise from time to time could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor a description of our current material litigation, see Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, from time to time, we have been a party to certain intellectual property infringement litigation as more fully described above under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business - Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could result in expensive litigation or require us to obtain a license to use the technology from third parties, or we may be prohibited from selling certain products in the future.\u201d\nThe inability to obtain government licenses and approvals for desired international trading activities or technology transfers may prevent the profitable operation of our business.\nMany of our present and future business activities are subject to licensing by the United States government under the Export Administration Act, the Export Administration Regulations and other laws, regulations and requirements governing international trade and technology transfer. We presently manufacture products in China and Thailand that require such licenses. The profitable operations of our business may require the continuity of these licenses and may require further licenses and approvals for future products in these and other countries. However, there is no certainty to the continuity of these licenses, nor that further desired licenses and approvals may be obtained.\nPrior to our acquisition of Opnext, Opnext licensed its intellectual property to Hitachi and its wholly owned subsidiaries without restriction. In addition, Hitachi is free to license certain of Hitachi\u2019s intellectual property that Opnext used in its business to any third party, including competitors, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOpnext was initially created as a stand-alone entity by acquiring certain assets of Hitachi through various transactions. In connection with these transactions, Opnext acquired a number of patents and know-how from Hitachi, but also granted Hitachi and its wholly owned subsidiaries a perpetual right to continue to use those patents and know-how, as well as other patents and\nknow-how that Opnext developed during a period which ended in July 2011 (or October 2012 in certain cases). This license back to Hitachi is broad and permits Hitachi to use this intellectual property for any products or services anywhere in the world, including licensing this intellectual property to our competitors.\nAdditionally, while significant intellectual property owned by Hitachi was assigned to Opnext when Opnext was formed, Hitachi retained and only licensed to Opnext the intellectual property rights to underlying technologies used in both Opnext products and the products of Hitachi. Under the agreement, Hitachi remains free to license these intellectual property rights to the underlying technologies to any party, including competitors. The intellectual property that has been retained by Hitachi and that can be licensed in this manner does not relate solely or primarily to one or more of Opnext\u2019s products, or groups of products; rather, the intellectual property that is licensed to Opnext by Hitachi is generally used broadly across Opnext\u2019s entire product portfolio. Competition by third parties using the underlying technologies retained by Hitachi could harm the Opnext business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record additional impairment charges that will adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs of June 27, 2015, we had $2.6 million in other intangible assets and $41.8 million of property and equipment, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge related to these assets, which would adversely impact our results of operations. If impairment has occurred, we will be required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the other intangible assets in the period in which such determination is made. The testing of other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about the future performance and cash flows of our business, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry, or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future reporting unit operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value of one or more reporting units, and result in an impairment charge.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we completed our annual analysis for potential impairment of our goodwill, which included examining, based on factors and conditions then existing, the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects and the current level of our market capitalization. Based on this analysis, we determined that the goodwill related to our Mintera reporting unit was fully impaired. This resulted in a $10.9 million impairment charge in our statement of operations for fiscal year 2013. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we recorded $0.9 million in impairment charges related to the impairment of certain technology that is now considered redundant following the acquisition of Opnext. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, we recorded an additional $13.7 million impairment charge related to the impairment of intangible assets related to certain technologies and we recorded impairment charges of $1.7 million related to other long-lived assets.\nOur business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control.\nOur business and operating results are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, tsunami, volcanic activity and floods, as well as other events beyond our control such as power loss, telecommunications failures and uncertainties arising out of terrorist attacks in the United States and armed conflicts overseas. For example, in the latter three quarters of fiscal year 2012, our results of operations were materially and adversely impacted by the flooding in Thailand. Additionally, our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development and manufacturing operations are located in Silicon Valley, California, and select manufacturing facilities are located in Japan. These regions in particular have been vulnerable to natural disasters, such as the 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that occurred in Japan. The occurrence of any of these events could pose physical risks to our property and personnel, which may adversely affect our ability to produce and deliver products to our customers. Although we presently maintain insurance against certain of these events, we cannot be certain that our insurance will be adequate to cover any damage sustained by us or by our customers.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we are subject to environmental and import/export laws and regulations that may expose us to liability and increase our costs.\nWe handle hazardous materials as part of our manufacturing activities. Consequently, our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use and handling of hazardous substances and waste disposal. We may incur costs to comply with current or future environmental laws. As with other companies engaged in manufacturing activities that involve hazardous materials, a risk of environmental liability is inherent in our manufacturing activities, as is the risk that our facilities will be shut down in the event of a release of hazardous waste, or that we would be subject to extensive monetary liabilities. The costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation efforts or other\nenvironmental liabilities could adversely affect our business. Under applicable European Union regulations, we, along with other electronics component manufacturers, are prohibited from using lead and certain other hazardous materials in our products. We could lose business or face product returns if we fail to maintain these requirements properly.\nIn addition, the sale and manufacture of certain of our products require on-going compliance with governmental security and import/export regulations. We may, in the future, be subject to investigation which may result in fines for violations of security and import/export regulations. Furthermore, any disruptions of our product shipments in the future, including disruptions as a result of efforts to comply with governmental regulations, could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and results of operations.\nThe new disclosure requirements related to the \u201cconflict minerals\u201d provision of the Dodd-Frank Act may limit our supply and increase our costs for certain metals used in our products and could affect our reputation with customers or shareholders.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a new rule requiring public companies to disclose the use of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The new rule, which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and required a disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by June 2, 2014, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country. Portions of the new rule have been challenged in the courts and may be subject to further interpretation and amendment either of which could impose additional or different obligations on us. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacturing of our products. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. If we cannot determine that our products exclude conflict minerals sourced from the DRC or adjoining countries, some of our customers may discontinue, or materially reduce, purchases of our products, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect your rights as a stockholder of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1.0 million shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for a third-party to gain control of us;\n\u2022\ndiscourage bids for our common stock at a premium;\n\u2022\nlimit or eliminate any payments that the holders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation; or\n\u2022\notherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may in the future issue shares of authorized preferred stock at any time.\nDelaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board of directors to issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u2022\ncreating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\npermitting the board of directors to increase the size of the board and to fill vacancies;\n\u2022\nrequiring a super-majority vote of our stockholders to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which limit the right of a corporation to engage in a business combination with a holder of 15 percent or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting securities, or certain affiliated persons. We do not currently have a stockholder rights plan in place.\nAlthough we believe that these charter and bylaw provisions, and provisions of Delaware law, provide an opportunity for the board to assure that our stockholders realize full value for their investment, they could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, even under circumstances that some stockholders may consider beneficial.", "PERMNO": 90354, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "OCLR"}
