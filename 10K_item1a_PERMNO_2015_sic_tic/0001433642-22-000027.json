{"cik": "1433642", "company": "Hamilton Lane INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe historical performance of our investments should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our investments or our operations or any returns expected on an investment in our Class A common stock.\nPast performance of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts or the investments that we recommend to our advisory clients is not necessarily indicative of future results or of the performance of our Class A common stock. An investment in our Class A common stock is not an investment in any of our specialized funds or customized separate accounts. In addition, the historical and potential future returns of specialized funds and customized separate accounts that we manage are not directly linked to returns on our Class A common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or the investments that we recommend to our advisory clients will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our Class A common stock. However, poor performance of our specialized funds or customized separate accounts could cause a decline in our revenue, and could therefore have a negative effect on our performance and on returns on an investment in our Class A common stock.\nThe historical performance of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future performance of these funds or of any future funds we may raise, in part because:\n\u2022market conditions and investment opportunities during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than those we may experience in the future;\n\u2022the performance of our funds is generally calculated on the basis of NAV of the funds\u2019 investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized;\n\u2022our historical returns derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed;\n\u2022our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they initially deploy their capital;\n\u2022competition continues to increase for investment opportunities, which may reduce our returns in the future;\n\u2022the performance of particular funds also will be affected by risks of the industries and businesses in which they invest; and\n\u2022we may create new funds that reflect a different asset mix and new investment strategies, as well as a varied geographic and industry exposure, compared to our historical funds, and any such new funds could have different returns from our previous funds.\nThe success of our business depends on the identification and availability of suitable investment opportunities for our clients.\nOur success largely depends on the identification and availability of suitable investment opportunities for our clients, and in particular the success of funds in which our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts invest. The availability of investment opportunities will be subject to market conditions and other factors outside of our control and the control of the private markets fund managers with which we invest. Past returns of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not continue or reoccur, including favorable borrowing conditions in the debt markets, and there can be no assurance that our specialized funds, customized separate accounts, advisory accounts or the underlying funds in which we invest will be able to avail themselves of comparable opportunities and conditions. There can also be no assurance that the private markets funds we select will be able to identify sufficient attractive investment opportunities to meet their investment objectives. Further, the due diligence investigations we conduct before recommending investments to our clients may not uncover all facts relevant to the suitability of such opportunities. See \u201c-The due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment\u201d for more information on the risks we face in connection with the due diligence process.\nCompetition for access to investment funds and other investments we make for our clients is intense.\nWe seek to maintain excellent relationships with general partners and managers of investment funds, including those in which we have previously made investments for our clients and those in which we may in the future invest, as well as sponsors of investments that might provide direct investment opportunities in portfolio companies alongside the sponsoring fund manager. However, because of the number of investors seeking to gain access to investment funds and direct investment opportunities managed or sponsored by the top performing fund managers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the opportunity to invest on behalf of our clients in all or a substantial portion of the investments we select, or that the size of the investment opportunities available to us will be as large as we would desire. Access to secondary investment opportunities is also highly competitive and is often controlled by a limited number of general partners, fund managers and intermediaries.\nCustomized separate account and advisory account fee revenue is not a long-term contracted source of revenue and is subject to intense competition.\nOur revenue in any given period is dependent on the number of fee-paying clients and corresponding level of AUM/AUA in such period. Our customized separate account and advisory account business operates in a highly competitive environment where typically there are no long-term contracts. While clients of our customized separate account and advisory account businesses may have multi-year contracts, many of these contracts are terminable upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 advance notice to us. We may lose clients as a result of a change in ownership, control or senior management, a client\u2019s decision to transition to in-house asset management rather than partner with a third-party provider such as us, competition from other financial advisors and financial institutions, changes to their investment policies and other causes. Moreover, a number of our contracts with state government-sponsored clients are secured through such government\u2019s mandated procurement process, and can be subject to periodic renewal. If multiple clients were to exercise their termination rights or fail to renew their existing contracts and we were unable to secure new clients or maintain our levels of AUM/AUA, our customized separate account and advisory account fees would decline materially. A significant reduction in the number of fee-paying clients and/or AUM/AUA levels in any given period could reduce our revenue and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs we expand the scope of our business, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our advisory and investment management businesses. For example, we may recommend that various advisory\nclients invest in specialized funds managed by us. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor dissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. As a registered investment advisor, we owe our clients a fiduciary duty and are required to provide disinterested advice. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including an inability to raise additional funds, attract new clients or retain existing clients.\nWe have obligations to investors in our specialized funds and customized separate accounts and may have obligations to other third parties that may conflict with your interests.\nOur subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of or advisors to our specialized funds and customized separate accounts have fiduciary and contractual obligations to the investors in those funds and accounts, and some of our subsidiaries may have contractual duties to other third parties. As a result, we may take actions with respect to the allocation of investments among our specialized funds and customized separate accounts (including funds and accounts that have different fee structures), the purchase or sale of investments in our specialized funds and customized separate accounts, the structuring of investment transactions for those specialized funds and customized separate accounts, the advice we provide or other actions in order to comply with these fiduciary and contractual obligations. In addition, because most of our senior management and other professionals hold most of their economic interests in us through HLA and certain of its affiliates, which are not subject to U.S. federal and state entity-level income taxes, and our Class A common stockholders hold their interests through Hamilton Lane Incorporated, which is subject to entity-level taxation as a corporation in the United States, conflicts relating to the selection and structuring of investments or other matters may arise between senior management and our other professionals, on the one hand, and the Class A stockholders of Hamilton Lane Incorporated, on the other hand.\nOur ability to retain our senior management team and attract additional qualified investment professionals is critical to our success.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our senior management team and to recruit additional qualified investment, sales and other professionals. The individuals that comprise our senior management team possess substantial experience and expertise and, in many cases, have significant relationships with certain of our clients. Accordingly, the loss of any one of our senior management team could adversely affect certain client relationships or limit our ability to successfully execute our investment strategies, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to retain and attract qualified investment professionals, we expect to experience a general rise in compensation and benefits expense commensurate with expected growth in headcount and with the need to maintain competitive compensation levels, which could cause our total employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of our total revenue to increase and adversely affect our profitability. However, we may not be successful in our efforts, as the market for investment professionals is extremely competitive. In addition, the governing agreements of our specialized funds typically require the suspension of the commitment period if, depending on the fund, between two and ten designated members of our senior management team cease to devote sufficient professional time to or cease to be employed by HLA, often called a \u201ckey person event,\u201d or in connection with certain other events. The occurrence of a key person event could also affect investment periods under our limited partnership agreements. Any change to our senior management team could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to expand our business and may enter into new lines of business, geographic markets or strategic partnerships, which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business.\nWe currently generate substantially all of our revenue from asset management and advisory services. However, we intend to grow our business by offering additional products and services, by entering into new lines of business, by entering into, or expanding our presence in, new geographic markets and by entering into\nselected strategic partnerships and corporate investments. Entry into certain lines of business or geographic markets, the introduction of new types of investment structures, products or services and funding strategic partnerships and corporate investments has and could continue to increase our operational costs and may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, which may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. For example, we have recently undertaken business initiatives to reach an increasing number of retail investors, which exposes us to greater levels of risk, including heightened litigation, regulatory enforcement and reputational risks. To the extent distribution of our retail or other products is through third-party distributors with whom we engage, we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution, which could result in claims that products distributed through such channels are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or that they are distributed in an otherwise inappropriate manner. Third-party distributors may use traditional or newer channels of distribution (such as through digital securities exchanges). We are exposed to the risks of reputational damage and legal liability to the extent such third parties we engage, whom we do not control, improperly sell our products to investors. This risk increases as the number of third-party distributors increases. We have also launched our first special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d), Hamilton Lane Alliance Holdings I, Inc. (\u201cHLAH\u201d), with the goal of raising additional SPACs in the future, depending on market and other conditions. HLAH is sponsored by a wholly-owned subsidiary of HLA that will assist in identifying and effectuating a merger between HLAH and a target company. We view the sponsorship of SPACs as an extension of our pre-existing investment activities, but participation in the SPAC market exposes us and our affiliates to additional risks, including heightened litigation, regulatory enforcement and reputational risks as well as the potential loss of our investment if a suitable target company is not identified for the initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe.\nTo the extent we enter into new lines of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, that we do not have the required investment of capital and other resources and that we could potentially lose clients due to the perception that we are no longer focusing on our core business. We have from time to time and intend to continue to explore opportunities to grow our business via acquisitions, partnerships, investments or other strategic transactions. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify, negotiate or complete such transactions, that any completed transactions will produce favorable financial results or that we will be able to successfully integrate an acquired business with ours.\nIn addition, certain aspects of our cost structure, such as costs for compensation, occupancy leases, communication and information technology services, and depreciation and amortization are largely fixed, and we may not be able to timely adjust these costs to match fluctuations in revenue related to growing our business or entering into new lines of business. If a new business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA decline in the pace or size of fundraising or investments made by us on behalf of our specialized funds or customized separate accounts may adversely affect our revenues.\nThe revenues that we earn are driven in part by the amount of capital committed by our clients for investment, our fundraising efforts and the pace at which we make investments on behalf of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. A decline in the pace or the size of fundraising efforts or investments may reduce our revenues. The private markets investing environment continues to see increased competition, which can make fundraising and the deployment of capital more difficult. In addition, many other factors could cause a decline in the pace of investment, including a market environment characterized by relative high prices, the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities and decreased availability of capital on attractive terms. Further, we may fail to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business, regulatory or legal complexities or uncertainty and adverse developments in the U.S. or global economy, financial markets, geopolitical conditions and our ability to deploy capital in certain countries may be adversely impacted by U.S. and foreign government policy changes and regulations.\nIn addition, if we are unable to deploy capital at a pace that is sufficient to offset the pace of realizations, our fee revenues could decrease.\nFor our specialized funds and customized separate accounts that charge fees based on invested capital, such a decline in the pace of investments may reduce our revenue more acutely. In addition, fees based on invested capital may create an incentive to make investments earlier in the specialized fund\u2019s or customized separate account\u2019s life than it otherwise would if fees were charged based purely on capital commitments, which has more predictability for revenues.\nOur indebtedness may expose us to substantial risks.\nWe maintain a Term Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the \u201cTerm Loan Agreement\u201d), a Multi-Draw Term Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the \u201cMulti-Draw Term Loan Agreement\u201d) and a Revolving Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the \u201cRevolving Loan Agreement\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Agreement and the Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement, the \u201cLoan Agreements\u201d) with First Republic Bank (\u201cFirst Republic\u201d). The Term Loan Agreement matures on July 1, 2027, the Revolving Loan Agreement matures on March 24, 2023 and the Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement matures on July 1, 2030. For more information on our Loan Agreements, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Loan Agreements\u201d.\nWe expect to continue to utilize debt to finance our operations, which will expose us to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage. An increase in leverage could make it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities, or to make necessary capital expenditures. Any portion of our cash flow required for debt service would not be available for our operations, distributions, dividends or other purposes. Any substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or any substantial increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements or force us to modify our operations. Further, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain new borrowings or refinance existing borrowings on favorable terms when they mature. Our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business, regulatory and economic conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to remain in compliance with the financial or other covenants contained in the Loan Agreements.\nThe Loan Agreements contain, and any future debt instruments may contain, financial and other covenants that impose requirements on us and limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in certain transactions or activities, such as:\n\u2022 incur additional debt;\n\u2022 provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022 make loans, advances and investments;\n\u2022 make certain payments in respect of equity interests, including, among others, the payment of dividends and other distributions, redemptions and similar payments, payments in respect of warrants, options and other rights, and payments in respect of subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with investment funds and affiliates;\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 enter into negative pledges;\n\u2022 sell all or any part of the business, assets or property, or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022 make acquisitions or consolidate or merge with other persons;\n\u2022 enter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022 change the nature of our business;\n\u2022 change our fiscal year;\n\u2022 make certain modifications to organizational documents or certain material contracts;\n\u2022 make certain modifications to certain other debt documents; and\n\u2022 enter into certain agreements with respect to the repayment of indebtedness, the making of loans or advances, or the transfer of assets.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain leverage levels in compliance with the financial covenants included in the Loan Agreements. These restrictions may limit our flexibility in operating our business, and any failure to comply with these financial and other covenants, if not waived, would cause a default or event of default. Our obligations under the Loan Agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets. In the case of an event of default, creditors may exercise rights and remedies, including the rights and remedies of a secured party, under such agreements and applicable law, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on our Loan Agreements, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Loan Agreements\u201d.\nDependence on leverage by certain funds and portfolio companies subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect the ability of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nCertain of the specialized funds we manage, the funds in which we invest and portfolio companies within our funds and customized separate accounts currently rely on leverage. If our specialized funds or the companies in which our specialized funds or customized separate accounts invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan and high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to businesses generally, the cost or terms on which lenders are willing to lend, or the strength of the overall economy.\nThe absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments, and, in the case of rising interest rates, decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments made by our funds. Certain investments may also be financed through fund-level debt facilities, which may or may not be available for refinancing on favorable terms, or at all, at the end of their respective terms. Finally, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense on indebtedness used to finance our specialized funds\u2019 investments reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments and make it more costly to use debt financing. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Industry-Extensive government regulation, compliance failures and changes in law or regulation could adversely affect us.\u201d Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, private markets fund portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets to obtain additional financing for their operations. The leveraged capital structure of such businesses increases the exposure of the funds\u2019 portfolio companies to adverse economic factors such as rising interest rates, downturns in the economy or deterioration in the condition of such business or its industry. Any adverse impact caused by the use of leverage by portfolio companies in which we directly or indirectly invest could in turn adversely affect the returns of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts.\nDefaults by clients and third-party investors in certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts could adversely affect that fund\u2019s operations and performance.\nOur business is exposed to the risk that clients that owe us money for our services may not pay us, and investors may default on their obligations to fund their commitments. We believe that these risks could potentially increase during periods of economic uncertainty, such as in the case of difficult or volatile market and geopolitical conditions. If investors in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts default on their obligations to fund commitments, there may be adverse consequences on the investment process, and we could incur losses and be unable to meet underlying capital calls. For example, investors in most of our specialized funds make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We depend on investors fulfilling and honoring their commitments when we call capital from them for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations when due. In addition, certain of our funds may utilize lines of credit to fund investments. Because interest expense and other costs of borrowings under lines of credit are an expense of the fund, the fund\u2019s net multiple of invested capital may be reduced, as well as the amount of carried interest generated by the fund. Any material reduction in the amount of carried interest generated by a fund may adversely affect our revenues.\nAny investor that did not fund a capital call would be subject to several possible penalties, including having a meaningful amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund. For instance, if an investor has invested little or no capital early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. A failure of investors to honor a significant amount of capital calls could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with investment guidelines set by our clients could result in damage awards against us or a reduction in AUM, either of which would cause our earnings to decline and adversely affect our business.\nWhen clients retain us to manage assets on their behalf, they specify certain guidelines regarding investment allocation and strategy that we are required to observe in the management of their portfolios. Our failure to comply with these guidelines and other limitations could result in clients terminating their investment management agreement with us, as these agreements generally are terminable without cause on 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. Clients could also sue us for breach of contract and seek to recover damages from us. In addition, such guidelines may restrict our ability to pursue certain allocations and strategies on behalf of our clients that we believe are economically desirable, which could similarly result in losses to a client account or termination of the account and a corresponding reduction in AUM. Even if we comply with all applicable investment guidelines, a client may be dissatisfied with its investment performance or our services or fees, and may terminate their customized separate accounts or advisory accounts or be unwilling to commit new capital to our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts. Any of these events could cause our earnings to decline and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMisconduct by our employees, advisors or third-party service providers could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nThere is a risk that our employees, advisors or third-party service providers could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We are subject to a number of laws, obligations and standards arising from our advisory and investment management businesses and our discretionary authority over the assets we manage. The violation of these laws, obligations and standards by any of our employees, advisors or third-party service providers would adversely affect our clients and us by subjecting us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence. Our business also often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies and funds in which we may invest for our clients. If our employees, advisors or third-party service providers were to engage in fraudulent activity, violate\nregulatory standards or improperly use or disclose sensitive or confidential information, we could be subject to legal or regulatory action and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. The pervasiveness of social media, coupled with increased public focus on the externalities of activities unrelated to the business, could further magnify the reputational risks associated with negative publicity. It is not always possible to detect or deter misconduct, and the extensive precautions we take that seek to detect and prevent undesirable activity may not be effective in all cases. In addition, allowing employees to work remotely may require us to develop and implement additional precautions in order to detect and prevent employee misconduct. Such additional precautions, which may include the implementation of security and other restrictions, may make our systems more difficult and costly to operate and may not be effective in preventing employee misconduct in a remote work environment. If one of our employees, advisors or third-party service providers were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of misconduct, our business and our reputation could be materially and adversely affected. Further, we are subject to the risk that our service providers may default on their contractual obligations to us, which could result in significant disruption to our operations and ability to serve our clients. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Industry-Extensive government regulation, compliance failures and changes in law or regulation could adversely affect us.\u201d\nIf the investments we make on behalf of our specialized funds or customized separate accounts perform poorly, we may suffer a decline in our investment management revenue and earnings, and our ability to raise capital for future specialized funds and customized separate accounts may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur revenue from our investment management business is derived from fees earned for our management of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts, incentive fees, or carried interest, with respect to certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts, and monitoring and reporting fees. In the event that our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or individual investments perform poorly, our revenues and earnings derived from incentive fees will decline, and it will be more difficult for us to raise capital for new specialized funds or gain new or retain current customized separate account clients in the future. In addition, if carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled, we may be required to repay that amount under a \u201cclawback\u201d obligation. The risk of clawback can occur as a result of diminished investment performance. If we are unable to repay the amount of the clawback, we would be subject to liability for a breach of our contractual obligations. If we are unable to raise or are required to repay capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe timing at which we receive distributions of carried interest, an element of our revenues, can be sporadic and unpredictable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOur cash flow may fluctuate significantly due to the fact that we receive carried interest distributions only when investments are realized and achieve a certain preferred return based on performance. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, raise all funds needed to make an investment and then realize the cash value (or other proceeds) of an investment. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be a number of years before any profits can be realized in cash (or other proceeds). We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur, and thus, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of carried interest distributions to us. If we were to receive a distribution of carried interest in a particular quarter, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter, which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. As a result, achieving steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis may be difficult, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements or general increased volatility in the price of our Class A common stock.\nThe exercise of redemption or repurchase rights by investors in our evergreen funds may adversely affect our revenues.\nCertain of our specialized funds contain investor liquidity features. While these features are subject to certain limitations, and such funds maintain multiple sources of liquidity to fund potential redemption or repurchase requests, multiple and sustained requests could exhaust these sources of liquidity and create pressure to dispose of investments by such funds sooner than anticipated to satisfy such redemption requests. The investments of such funds are generally illiquid in nature and disposing of such investments within the necessary timeframe could reduce the price at which counterparties are willing to transact. In most cases, transferring such investments requires the consent of a third-party sponsor, and, if such sponsors are unwilling to consent, a fund may need to liquidate a less desirable investment as an alternative. Such accelerated disposition could reduce or eliminate our potential carried interest associated with such investment, and the reduction in such fund\u2019s NAV resulting from the redemption or repurchase would reduce the management fees payable to us.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets in our specialized funds and customized separate accounts can be significantly subjective, and the values of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our specialized funds and customized separate accounts.\nThere are no readily ascertainable market prices for a large number of the investments in our specialized funds, customized separate accounts, advisory accounts or the funds in which we invest. The value of the fund investments of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts is determined periodically by us based on the fair value of such investments as reported by the underlying fund managers. Our valuation of the funds in which we invest is largely dependent upon the processes employed by the managers of those funds. The fair value of investments is determined using a number of methodologies described in the particular funds\u2019 valuation policies. These policies are based on a number of factors, including the nature of the investment, the expected cash flows from the investment, the length of time the investment has been held, restrictions on transfer and other generally accepted valuation methodologies. The value of the direct-equity and credit investments of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts is determined periodically by us using independent third-party valuation firms to aid us in determining the fair value of these investments using generally accepted valuation methodologies. These may include references to market multiples, valuations for comparable companies, public or private market transactions, subsequent developments concerning the companies to which the securities relate, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and projections of such companies provided to the general partner and such other factors that we may deem relevant. The methodologies we use in valuing individual investments are based on a variety of estimates and assumptions specific to the particular investments, and actual results related to the investment may vary materially as a result of the inaccuracy of such assumptions or estimates. In addition, because the illiquid investments held by our specialized funds, customized separate accounts, advisory accounts and the funds in which we invest may be in industries or sectors that are unstable, in distress, or undergoing some uncertainty, such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company-specific or industry-wide developments.\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in a fund\u2019s NAV do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained if such investments were sold. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in fund NAVs could result in losses for the applicable fund and the loss of potential incentive fees by the fund\u2019s manager and us. Also, a situation in which asset values turn out to be materially different from values reflected in fund NAVs, whether due to misinformation or otherwise, could cause investors to lose confidence in us and may, in turn, result in difficulties in our ability to raise additional capital, retain clients or attract new clients. Further, we often engage third-party valuation agents to assist us with the valuations. It is possible that a material fact related to the target of the valuation might be inadvertently omitted from our communications with them, resulting in an inaccurate valuation.\nFurther, the SEC has instituted enforcement actions against advisors for misleading investors about valuation. If the SEC were to investigate and find errors in our methodologies or procedures, we and/or members of our management could be subject to penalties and fines, which could harm our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur investment management activities may involve investments in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets, and we and our clients may lose some or all of the amounts invested in these activities or fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time.\nThe investments made by our specialized funds and customized separate accounts and recommended by our advisory services may include high-risk, illiquid assets. We generally have made and expect to continue to make principal investments alongside our investors, as the general partner, in our existing private markets funds and certain customized separate accounts and in any new private markets funds we may establish in the future. The private markets funds in which we invest capital generally invest in securities that are not publicly traded. Even if such securities are publicly traded, many of these funds may be prohibited by contract or applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. Such funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available. Accordingly, the private markets funds in which we invest our clients\u2019 capital may not be able to sell securities when they desire and therefore may not be able to realize the full value of such securities. The ability of private markets funds to dispose of investments is dependent in part on the public equity and debt markets, to the extent that the ability to dispose of an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an IPO of the portfolio company in which such investment is held or the ability of a prospective buyer of the portfolio company to raise debt financing to fund its purchase. Furthermore, large holdings of publicly traded equity securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial period of time, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the disposition period. Contributing capital to these funds is risky, and we may lose some or the entire amount of our specialized funds\u2019 and our clients\u2019 investments.\nThe portfolio companies in which private markets funds have invested or may invest will sometimes involve a high degree of business and financial risk. These companies may be in an early stage of development, may not have a proven operating history, may be operating at a loss or have significant variations in operating results, may be engaged in a rapidly changing business with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, may be subject to extensive regulatory oversight, may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position, may have a high level of leverage, or may otherwise have a weak financial condition. See \u201c-Dependence on leverage by certain funds and portfolio companies subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect the ability of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\u201d\nIn addition, these portfolio companies may face intense competition, including competition from companies with greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing, and other capabilities, and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. Portfolio companies in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be subject to additional risks, including changes in currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations, risks associated with different types (and lower quality) of available information, expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse political and regulatory developments. In addition, during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns in a particular investment category, industry or region, portfolio companies may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased costs. During these periods, these companies may also have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations and may be unable to pay their expenses as they become due. A general market downturn or a specific market dislocation may result in lower investment returns for the private markets funds or portfolio companies in which our specialized funds and customized separate accounts invest, which consequently would materially and adversely affect investment returns for our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. Furthermore, if the portfolio companies default on their indebtedness, or otherwise seek or are forced to restructure their obligations or declare bankruptcy, we could lose some or all of our investment and suffer reputational harm.\nWe may pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities.\nWe may pursue investment opportunities that have unusually complex business, regulatory and/or legal aspects to them. Some of our investments may be structured as an investment in which we only acquire a minority interest or in which two or more investors serve together or collectively as equity sponsors, which generally means that any governance rights must be shared with the other investors. Accordingly, decisions relating to the investment may be made by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on the returns achieved by us on the investment. Complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute, it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions and such transactions sometimes involve a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur specialized funds and customized separate accounts may face risks relating to undiversified investments.\nWe cannot give assurance as to the degree of diversification that will be achieved in any of our specialized funds or customized separate accounts. Difficult market conditions or slowdowns affecting a particular asset class, industry, geographic region or other category of investment could have a significant adverse impact on a given specialized fund or customized separate account if its investments are concentrated in that area, which would result in lower investment returns. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a specialized fund or customized separate account could adversely affect its investment performance and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur specialized funds and customized separate accounts make investments in funds and companies that we do not control.\nInvestments by most of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. Our specialized funds and customized separate accounts may invest through direct investment arrangements or acquire minority equity interests and may also dispose of a portion of their equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in their retaining a minority investment. Consequently, the performance of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts will depend significantly on the investment and other decisions made by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on the returns achieved by our specialized funds or customized separate accounts. Portfolio companies in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree. In addition, the majority stakeholders or our management may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the values of our investments and the investments we have made on behalf of clients could decrease and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result.\nInvestments by our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts may in many cases rank junior to investments made by other investors.\nIn many cases, the companies in which our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts invest have indebtedness or equity securities, or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities, that rank senior to our clients\u2019 investments in our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts. By their terms, these instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our clients\u2019 investments. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which one or more of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts hold an investment, holders of securities ranking senior to our clients\u2019 investments would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our clients\u2019 investments. After repaying senior security holders, the company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed in respect of our clients\u2019 investments. To the extent that any assets remain, holders of claims that rank equally with our clients\u2019 investments would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. Also, during periods of financial distress or\nfollowing an insolvency, our ability to influence a company\u2019s affairs and to take actions to protect investments by our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts may be substantially less than that of those holding senior interests.\nThe substantial growth of our business in recent years may be difficult to sustain, as it may place significant demands on our resources and employees and will increase our expenses.\nThe substantial growth of our business has placed, and if it continues, will continue to place, significant demands on our infrastructure, our investment team and other employees, and will increase our expenses. We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration, motivation and doing the right thing. If we do not continue to develop and implement appropriate processes and tools to maintain this culture, particularly in light of rapid and significant growth in our employee population, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are required to develop continuously our infrastructure in response to the increasingly complex investment management industry and increasing sophistication of investors. Legal and regulatory developments also contribute to the level of our expenses. The future growth of our business will depend, among other things, on our ability to maintain the appropriate infrastructure and staffing levels to sufficiently address our growth and will require us to incur significant additional expenses and commit additional senior management and operational resources. We may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and operational controls as well as implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures. Training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely and cost-effective basis may also pose challenges. In addition, our efforts to retain or attract qualified investment professionals is expected to result in significant additional expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our growing business effectively or that we will be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.\nWe may not be able to maintain our desired fee structure as a result of industry pressure from private markets investors to reduce fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nWe may find it harder to retain and raise funds, and we may lose investment opportunities in the future, if we do not match the prices, structures and terms offered by our competitors. We may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from private markets investors to reduce fees. In order to maintain our desired fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that incentivize our investors to pay our desired fee rates. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our desired fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nOur risk management strategies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nRisk management applies to our investment management operations as well as to the investments we make for our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. We have developed and continue to update strategies and procedures specific to our business for managing risks, which include market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. Management of these risks can be very complex. These strategies and procedures may fail under some circumstances, particularly if we are confronted with risks that we have underestimated or not identified, including those related to difficult market or geopolitical conditions. Although we have risk management processes to ensure that we are not exposed to a single third-party service provider for significant periods of time, given the large number and size of our funds, we often have large positions with a single counterparty. If that counterparty is unable to perform its obligations or performs below our standards, our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and other investments may be\nadversely affected. In addition, some of our methods for managing the risks related to our clients\u2019 investments are based upon our analysis of historical private markets behavior. Statistical techniques are applied to these observations in order to arrive at quantifications of some of our risk exposures. Historical analysis of private markets returns requires reliance on valuations performed by fund managers, which may not be reliable measures of current valuations. These statistical methods may not accurately quantify our risk exposure if circumstances arise that were not observed in our historical data. In particular, as we enter new lines of business or offer new products, our historical data may be incomplete. Failure of our risk management techniques could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our right to receive incentive fees.\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nBefore making or recommending investments for our clients, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important, complex, and sometimes evolving, business, financial, tax, accounting, technological, environmental, social, governance and legal and regulatory issues. Outside consultants, legal advisors and accountants may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment and the parties involved. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, we rely on the resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations, and such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment ultimately being successful.\nMoreover, the due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including bribery, fraud or other illegal activities) or risks that are necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect and may be more widespread in certain jurisdictions. Many of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts have invested in emerging market countries that may not have established laws and regulations that are as stringent as in more developed nations, or where existing laws and regulations may not be consistently enforced. Due diligence on investment opportunities in these jurisdictions is frequently more complicated because consistent and uniform commercial practices in such locations may not have developed, and bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and corrupt practices can be especially difficult to detect in such locations. Such misconduct may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies and could negatively affect the valuations of investments in such companies. Further, we may not identify or foresee future developments that could have a material adverse effect on an investment, such as misconduct by personnel at companies in which our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts invest. Isolated incidents involving such matters have occurred in the past but have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Financial fraud or other deceptive practices, or failures by personnel at such companies to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions or other legal and regulatory requirements, could cause significant legal, reputational and business harm to us.\nIn addition, a substantial portion of our specialized funds are funds-of-funds, and therefore we are dependent on the due diligence investigation of the general partner or direct investment partner leading such investment. We have little or no control over their due diligence process, and any shortcomings in their due diligence could be reflected in the performance of the investment we make with them on behalf of our clients. Poor investment performance could lead clients to terminate their agreements with us and/or result in negative reputational effects, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, some matters covered by our due diligence process, such as ESG, are continuously evolving and we may not accurately or fully anticipate such evolution. With respect to ESG, the nature and scope of our due diligence will vary based on the investment, but may include a review of, among other things: energy management, air and water pollution, land contamination, diversity, human rights, employee health and\nsafety, accounting standards and bribery and corruption. Selecting and evaluating ESG factors is subjective by nature, and there is no guarantee that the criteria utilized or judgment exercised by us or a third-party ESG specialist we may engage will reflect the beliefs, values, internal policies or preferred practices of any particular client or market trends. The materiality of ESG risks and impacts on an individual potential investment or portfolio as a whole depend on many factors, including the relevant industry, country, asset class and investment style.\nRestrictions on our ability to collect and analyze data regarding our clients\u2019 investments could adversely affect our business.\nOur database of private markets investments includes funds and direct investments that we monitor and report on for our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts. We rely on our database to provide regular reports to our clients, to research developments and trends in private markets and to support our investment processes. We depend on the continuation of our relationships with the general partners and sponsors of the underlying funds and investments in order to maintain current data on these investments and private markets activity. The termination of such relationships or the imposition of restrictions on our ability to use the data we obtain for our reporting and monitoring services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also highly dependent upon the technology platforms within which our data is stored and analyzed, and any disruption in the services provided by such platforms, whether temporary or permanent, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively continue to operate our business without interruption. See \u201c-Operational risks may disrupt our business, damage our reputation, result in financial losses or limit our growth.\u201d\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, damage our reputation, result in financial losses or limit our growth.\nWe rely heavily on our and our third-party service providers\u2019 financial, accounting, compliance, monitoring, administration, reporting and other data processing systems. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or fail, including the loss of data, whether caused by fire, other natural disaster, power or telecommunications failure, computer viruses, malicious actors, acts of terrorism or war or otherwise, we could suffer a disruption of our business, financial loss, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions, as well as errors in recording, evaluating and accounting for them. Our and our third-party service providers\u2019 data processing systems and technology may be unable to accommodate our growth or adequately protect the information of our clients or address security risks, and the cost of maintaining and improving such systems and technology may increase from our current level. Such a failure or an increase in costs related to such information systems and technology, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. A disaster or a disruption in technology or infrastructure that supports our business, including a disruption involving electronic communications, cloud-based infrastructure or other services used by us, our third-party service providers or other third parties with whom we conduct business, or a disruption directly affecting our principal offices, could negatively impact our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that could result from such a disaster or disruption, and insurance and other safeguards may not reimburse us for the full amount of our losses.\nFailure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks or data security breaches could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe rely on the reasonably secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive information in our computer systems and networks, and those of our third-party service providers and their vendors. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store a range of data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information of our employees, our clients and other third parties, in our cloud applications and on our networks, as well as our third-party service\nproviders\u2019 systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations. We, our service providers and their vendors face various security threats on a regular basis, including ongoing cybersecurity threats to and attacks that are intended to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive or proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems. Cyber-incident techniques change frequently, may not immediately be recognized and can originate from a wide variety of sources. There has been an increase in the frequency, sophistication and ingenuity of the data security threats we and our service providers face. Any interruption or deterioration in performance, cybersecurity incidents or failures of information systems and technology could impair the quality of our or our funds\u2019 operations, affect our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the effectiveness of our and our service providers\u2019 information security policies, procedures and capabilities designed to protect our and their computer, network and telecommunications systems and the data such systems contain or transmit. Attacks on our or their information technology infrastructure could enable the attackers to gain unauthorized access to and steal our sensitive or proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems or divert or otherwise steal funds. Attacks could range from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because members of our senior management team may have public profiles or because, as an alternative investment management firm, we hold a significant amount of confidential and sensitive information about our clients and potential investments.\nAlthough we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our and our third-party service providers\u2019 computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. We, our employees and certain of our third-party service providers have been and expect to continue to be the target of hacking attacks, \u201cphishing\u201d or similar forms of social engineering attacks, and the subject of impersonations and fraudulent requests for money and other forms of activities. Such prior events, to date, have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, as restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic are lifted globally, we have given the majority of our employees the flexibility to work remotely or to split their time in hybrid remote/office work, which could introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. In addition, cybersecurity has become a top priority for regulators around the world. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the EU and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), and the SEC recently proposed new rules related to cybersecurity risk management for registered investment advisers and funds. See \u201c-Rapidly developing and changing privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage.\u201d Some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals and governmental agencies of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. Breaches in security, whether malicious in nature or through inadvertent transmittal or other loss of data, could potentially jeopardize our, our employees\u2019 or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 sensitive, confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks or those of our third-party service providers, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our employees\u2019, our clients\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in material financial losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to clients and other counterparties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, which, in turn, could cause a decline in our earnings and/or stock price. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with relevant laws and regulations or fail to provide the appropriate regulatory or other notifications of breach in a timely matter, it could result in regulatory investigations and material penalties, which could lead to negative publicity and may cause our clients to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nRapidly developing and changing privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, processing, storage and transmission of personal data and other sensitive and confidential information. Personal data is information that can be used to identify a natural person, including names, photos, email addresses, or computer IP addresses. This data is wide ranging and relates to our clients, employees, counterparties and other third parties. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the GDPR in the EU and the CCPA in the United States. Some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. Our compliance obligations include those relating to U.S. state laws and regulations, including, without limitation the CCPA, which provides for enhanced privacy protections for California residents, a private right of action for data breaches and statutory fines and damages for data breaches or other CCPA violations, as well as a requirement of \u201creasonable\u201d cybersecurity. We are also required to comply with foreign data collection and privacy laws in various non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we have offices or conduct business, including the GDPR, which applies to all organizations processing or holding personal data of EU data subjects (regardless of the organization\u2019s location) as well as to organizations outside the EU that offer goods or services in the EU, or that monitor the behavior of EU data subjects. Compliance with the GDPR requires us to analyze and evaluate how we handle data in the ordinary course of business, from processes to technology. EU data subjects need to be given full disclosure about how their personal data will be used and stored. In that connection, consent must be explicit and companies must be in a position to delete information from their global systems permanently if consent were withdrawn. Financial regulators and data protection authorities throughout the EU have broad audit and investigatory powers under the GDPR to probe how personal data is being used and processed. Penalties for non-compliance can be material. Our business is subject to many privacy laws in many other jurisdictions globally, including the U.K., Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and Australia. In addition, other countries and states are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost, complexity and regulatory enforcement risk of delivering our services. Global laws in this area are rapidly increasing in the scale and depth of their requirements, and are also often extra-territorial in nature. In addition, a wide range of regulators and private actors are seeking to enforce these laws across regions and borders. Furthermore, we frequently have privacy compliance requirements set forth in our contractual arrangements with counterparties. These legal, regulatory and contractual obligations heighten our privacy obligations in the ordinary course of conducting our business in the United States and globally.\nWhile we have taken various measures to help ensure that our policies, processes and systems are in compliance with our obligations, our potential liability remains, particularly given the continued and rapid development of privacy laws and regulations around the United States and the world, varied requirements from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, increased enforcement action and significant monetary penalties. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards and guidance, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, could result in significant regulatory and third-party liability, increased costs, disruption of our business and operations, and a loss of client confidence and other reputational damage. Furthermore, as new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to seek compliance with such laws and regulations continues to increase.\nOur failure or inability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our trademarks, service marks, trade names and other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business, including the value of our brands.\nWe own or have rights to trademarks, service marks or trade names that we use in connection with the operation of our business. In addition, our names, logos and website names and addresses are owned by us or licensed by us. We also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our solutions. Despite our efforts to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our trademarks, service marks, trade names and other intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, there can be no assurance that these\nprotections will be available in all cases, and our trademarks, service marks, trade names or other intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, declared generic, circumvented, infringed or otherwise violated. We may be unable to successfully resolve conflicts to our satisfaction. In the event that our trademarks, service marks or trade names are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, services or business, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources towards advertising and marketing new brands. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks, service marks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively. Any claims or customer confusion related to our trademarks, service marks or trade names could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of protection in such countries. Moreover, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, intellectual property laws in any jurisdiction may compromise our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. Policing and enforcing our intellectual property rights is difficult, costly and may not always be effective.\nWe may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability if our services are not regarded as satisfactory or for other reasons.\nAs a financial services firm, we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with our services, such dissatisfaction may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial advisors has been increasing. Our asset management and advisory activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and third parties, including our clients\u2019 stockholders or beneficiaries, under securities or other laws and regulations for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities and other transactions. In our investment management business, we make investment decisions on behalf of our clients, or make investment recommendations to our clients, that could result in substantial losses. Any such losses also may subject us to the risk of legal and regulatory liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. From time to time, we have been and may in the future be subject to legal action and incur significant legal expenses in defending such litigation. In addition, negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the private markets in general, whether or not based in truth, or litigation or regulatory action against us or any third-party managers recommended by us or involving us may tarnish our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain clients. Also, events that damage the reputation of our industry generally, such as highly publicized incidents of fraud or other scandals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of whether any of these events directly relate to our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts. Substantial legal or regulatory liability could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe are subject to increasing scrutiny from clients, investors and regulators with respect to ESG costs and impact of investments made by our specialized funds, which may constrain investment opportunities for our specialized funds and adversely affect our ability to raise capital from such clients and investors.\nIn recent years, clients and investors have placed increasing importance on ESG implications of investments made by private equity and other funds to which they commit capital. Certain investors have also demonstrated increased activism with respect to existing investments, including by urging asset managers to take certain actions that could adversely affect the value of an investment, or refrain from taking certain actions that could improve the value of an investment. At times, clients and investors have conditioned future\ncapital commitments on the taking or refraining from taking of such actions. Clients\u2019 and investors\u2019 increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may constrain our investment opportunities. In addition, clients and investors may decide to not commit capital to future fundraises as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the ESG cost of investments made by our specialized funds or their assessment that our specialized funds are insufficiently ambitious in allocating capital in ways that align with their ESG priorities. As part of their increased focus on the allocation of their capital to environmentally sustainable economic activities, certain clients and investors also have begun to request or require data to allow them to monitor the ESG impact of their investments. In addition, regulatory initiatives to require more disclosures regarding ESG matters are becoming increasingly common, which may further increase the number and type of clients and investors who place importance on these issues and who demand certain types of reporting from us. To the extent our access to capital from such clients and investors is impaired, we may not be able to maintain or increase the size of our specialized funds or raise sufficient capital for new specialized funds, which may adversely affect our revenues.\nThe transition to sustainable finance accelerates existing risks and raises new risks for our business that may impact our profitability and success. In particular, ESG matters have been the subject of increased focus by certain regulators, including in the United States and the EU. For example, in the United States, the SEC has identified ESG investing as an exam priority for investment advisers that offer ESG products and services, such as us. In particular, the SEC has focused on the labeling by funds of their activities or investments as \u201csustainable\u201d and examined the methodology used for determining ESG investments, with a focus on whether such labeling is misleading. Outside of the United States, the European Commission adopted an action plan on financing sustainable growth, as well as initiatives at the EU level, such as the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (\u201cSFDR\u201d), which imposes disclosure requirements on us and will affect our EEA operations (including where non-EEA products are marketed to EEA investors). The EU regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (\u201cTaxonomy Regulation\u201d) supplements SFDR\u2019s disclosure requirements for certain entities and sets out a framework for classifying economic activities as \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d. Compliance with the SFDR, Taxonomy Regulation and other ESG-related rules subjects us and our specialized funds to increased restrictions, disclosure obligations and compliance and other associated costs, as well as potential reputational harm if we do not properly comply, and there is considerable legal uncertainty about how to comply with these regimes. In addition, under the requirements of SFDR and other ESG-related regulations to which we may become subject, we are required to classify certain of our funds and their portfolio companies against certain criteria, some of which can be open to subjective interpretation. Our view on the appropriate classification may develop over time, including in response to statutory or regulatory guidance or changes in industry approach to classification. If regulators disagree with the procedures or standards we use for ESG or impact investing, or new regulations or legislation require a methodology of measuring or disclosing ESG impact that is different from our current practice, it could result in fines or other regulatory sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on fundraising efforts, our business as a whole and our reputation.\nIn addition, a lack of harmonization globally in relation to ESG legal and regulatory reform leads to a risk of fragmentation across global jurisdictions. This may create conflicts across our global business which could risk inhibiting our future implementation of, and compliance with, rapidly developing ESG standards and requirements. Failure to keep pace with sustainability transition could impact our competitiveness in the market and damage our reputation resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to manage risks involving ESG investing and compliance could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may consider ESG factors in connection with investments for certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts, and certain of our specialized funds are constructed with specific ESG or impact components. ESG factors are not universally agreed upon or accepted by investors, and our consideration of ESG factors or construction of specific ESG or impact funds could attract opposition from certain segments of our existing and potential client base. Any actual opposition to our consideration of ESG factors could impact our ability to maintain or raise capital for our funds, which may adversely impact our revenues.\nClimate change, climate change-related regulation and sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business and the operations of portfolio companies in which our specialized funds and customized separate accounts invest, and any actions we take or fail to take in response to such matters could damage our reputation.\nWe, our specialized funds and customized separate accounts and portfolio companies in which our specialized funds and customized separate accounts invest face risks associated with climate change including risks related to the impact of climate- and ESG-related legislation and regulation (both domestically and internationally), risks related to climate-related business trends and risks stemming from the physical impacts of climate change.\nNew climate change-related regulations or interpretations of existing laws may result in enhanced disclosure obligations, which could negatively affect us, our specialized funds and customized separate accounts and portfolio companies in which they invest and materially increase the regulatory burden and cost of compliance. In particular, compliance with climate- and other ESG-related rules in the EU and U.K. is expected to result in increased legal and compliance costs and expenses which would be borne by us and our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. These disclosure requirements could even be extended to private companies.\nCertain portfolio companies in which our specialized funds and customized separate accounts invest operate in sectors that could face transition risk if carbon-related regulations or taxes are implemented. For certain of these portfolio companies, business trends related to climate change may require capital expenditures, product or service redesigns, and changes to operations and supply chains to meet changing customer expectations. While this can create opportunities, not addressing these changed expectations could create business risks for portfolio companies, which could negatively impact the returns in our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. Further, advances in climate science may change society\u2019s understanding of sources and magnitudes of negative effects on climate, which could also negatively impact portfolio company financial performance. Further, significant physical effects of climate change including extreme weather events such as hurricanes or floods, can also have an adverse impact on certain portfolio companies and investments, especially those that rely on physical factories, plants or stores located in the affected areas, or that focus on tourism or recreational travel. As the effects of climate change increase, we expect the frequency and impact of weather and climate related events and conditions to increase as well.\nIn addition, our reputation may be harmed if certain stakeholders, such as our clients, believe that we are not adequately or appropriately responding to climate change, including through the way in which we operate our business, the composition of our specialized funds\u2019 and customized separate accounts\u2019 existing portfolios, the new investments made by them, or the decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to climate change considerations. In addition, we face business trend-related climate risks including the increased attention to ESG considerations by our clients in connection with their determination of whether to engage with us for our services.\nOur international operations are subject to certain risks, which may affect our revenue.\nWe intend to continue to grow our non-U.S. business, including growth into new regions with which we have less familiarity and experience, and this growth is important to our overall success. In addition, many of our clients are non-U.S. entities seeking to invest in U.S. funds and operating companies. Our international operations carry special financial and business risks, which could include the following:\n\u2022 greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations;\n\u2022 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results;\n\u2022 additional costs of complying with, and exposure to liability under, foreign regulatory regimes;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers;\n\u2022 longer transaction cycles;\n\u2022 higher operating costs;\n\u2022 local labor conditions and regulations;\n\u2022 adverse consequences or restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences, such as trapped foreign losses;\n\u2022 less stable political and economic environments;\n\u2022 potentially heightened risk of theft or compromise of data and intellectual property, in particular in those jurisdictions that do not have levels comparable to the United States of protection of proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and client information and records;\n\u2022 potentially compromised protections or rights to technology, data and intellectual property due to government regulation;\n\u2022 terrorism, political hostilities, war, public health crises and other civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity;\n\u2022 cultural and language barriers and the need to adopt different business practices in different geographic areas; and\n\u2022 difficulty collecting fees and, if necessary, enforcing judgments.\nAs part of our day-to-day operations outside the United States, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies, compliance policies and procedures and other administrative programs that comply with the laws of multiple countries. We also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global operations. Our failure to successfully manage and grow our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with non-U.S. standards and procedures. If our international business increases relative to our total business, these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our results of operations or growth prospects.\nA significant amount of the investments of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts include private markets funds that are located outside the United States or that invest in portfolio companies located outside the United States. Such non-U.S. investments involve certain factors not typically associated with U.S. investments, including risks related to (i) currency exchange matters, such as exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency in which the investments are denominated or commitments to the specialized funds or portfolio funds are denominated, and costs associated with conversion of investment proceeds and income from one currency to another, (ii) differences between the U.S. and foreign capital markets, including the absence of uniform accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision and regulation, (iii) certain economic, social and political risks, including exchange control regulations and restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, the risks of political, economic or social instability, and (iv) the possible imposition of foreign taxes with respect to such investments or confiscatory taxation. These risks could adversely affect the performance of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts that are invested in securities of non-U.S. companies, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny payment of distributions, loans or advances to and from our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions, foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate or other restrictions imposed by current or future agreements, including debt instruments, to which\nour non-U.S. subsidiaries may be a party. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted, possibly materially, if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in a volatile environment. If our international business increases relative to our total business, these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our operating results or growth prospects.\nIn addition, in January 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the European Union, and the transition period during which the U.K. was treated as a member of the EU ended December 31, 2020. Our business may be adversely affected by Brexit due to, among other things, disruption of the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people between the U.K. and the EU as well as potential changes to the legal and regulatory environment in the region. Furthermore, as a result of Brexit, our subsidiaries that are authorized and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority are no longer able to avail themselves of passporting rights under certain EU directives (such as the AIFMD and MiFID II) to provide services and perform activities outside the U.K. and in other parts of Europe. This may have an adverse impact on our results including the cost of, risk to, manner of conducting, and location of, our European business and our ability to hire and retain key staff in Europe. This may also adversely impact the markets in which we operate; the funds we manage or advise; our fund investors and our ability to raise capital from them; and ultimately the returns that may be achieved. While we have taken measures designed to allow us to continue to conduct our business in both the U.K. and the EU, Brexit may increase our cost of conducting business, interfere with our ability to market our products and provide our services and generally make it more difficult for us to pursue our objectives in the region.\nBrexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Compliance with any such new laws and regulations in the U.K. may be difficult and/or costly to implement and could adversely impact our ability to raise capital from investors in the U.K. and the EU, which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to clients, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, investment terms and conditions, brand recognition and business reputation. Our investment management business competes with a variety of traditional and alternative asset managers, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial institutions, and we expect that competition will continue to increase. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022 some of our competitors have more relevant experience, greater financial and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022 some of our specialized funds and investments that we recommend to our advisory clients may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products;\n\u2022 there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new asset management firms, including a relatively low cost of entering these lines of business, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business is expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u2022 if allocation of assets to alternative investment strategies increases, there will be increased competition for alternative investments and access to fund general partners and managers;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our specialized funds, particularly funds that directly use leverage or rely on debt financing of their portfolio companies to generate superior investment returns;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may be more successful than us in the development of new products to address investor demand for new or different investment strategies and/or regulatory changes, including with respect to products with mandates that incorporate ESG considerations, or products that are targeted toward retail;\n\u2022 developments in financial technology (or fintech), such as a distributed ledger technology (or blockchain), have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way financial institutions, as well as investment managers, do business, and could exacerbate these competitive pressures;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may be more successful than us in the development and implementation of new technology to address investor demand for product and strategy innovation;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain strategies or investments than us and/or bear less compliance expense than us;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in raising certain types of investment funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their clients;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may have more expertise or be regarded by investors as having more expertise in a specific strategy or geographic region;\n\u2022 certain investors may prefer to invest with private partnerships; and\n\u2022 other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.\nThis competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and restrict our ability to raise future funds, either of which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficult or volatile market, geopolitical and economic conditions can adversely affect our business and the investments made by our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts in many ways.\nOur business and the performance of investments made by our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts can be materially affected by difficult or volatile financial market and geopolitical conditions and events in the United States or throughout the world that are outside our control, including rising interest rates, inflation, the availability of credit, changes in laws, trade barriers, public health crises, natural disasters, civil unrest, trade conflicts, war or threat of war, terrorism or political uncertainty. These factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to them.\nMarket deterioration could cause us, the specialized funds and customized separate accounts we manage or the funds in which they invest to experience tightening of liquidity, reduced earnings and cash flow and impairment charges, as well as challenges in raising and deploying capital, obtaining investment financing and making investments on attractive terms. These market conditions can also have an impact on our ability and the ability of funds in which we and our clients invest to liquidate positions in a timely and efficient manner. To the extent periods of volatility are coupled with a lack of realizations from clients\u2019 existing private markets portfolios, such clients may be left with disproportionately outsized remaining commitments, which significantly limits their ability to make new commitments. In addition, during periods of adverse economic or geopolitical conditions, our specialized funds may have difficulty accessing financial markets, which could make it more difficult or impossible for them to obtain funding for additional investments. A general market downturn, or a specific market dislocation, may result in lower investment returns for our\nfunds, which would adversely affect our revenues. Furthermore, such conditions could also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds that have significant debt investments.\nOur business could generate lower revenue in a general economic downturn or a tightening of global credit markets. A general economic downturn or tightening of global credit markets may result in reduced opportunities to find suitable investments and make it more difficult for us, or the funds in which we and our clients invest, to exit and realize value from existing investments, potentially resulting in a decline in the value of the investments held in our clients\u2019 portfolios and a decrease in incentive fee revenue. Any reduction in the market value of the assets we manage will not likely be reported until one or more quarters after the end of the applicable performance period due to an inherent lag in the valuation process of private markets investments. This can result in a mismatch between stated valuation and current market conditions and can lead to delayed revelations of changes in performance and, therefore, delayed effects on our clients\u2019 portfolios. If our clients reduce their commitments to make investments in private markets in favor of investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk, our revenue or net income could decline as a result of lower fees being paid to us. Further, if, due to the lag in reporting, their decision to do so is made after the initial effects of a market downturn are felt by the rest of the economy, the adverse effect we experience as a result of that decision could likewise adversely affect our results of operations on a delayed basis.\nIn addition, our ability to find high-quality investment managers with whom to invest could become more limited in deteriorating or difficult market environments. Any such occurrence could delay our ability to invest capital, lead to lower returns on invested capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions. If our revenue declines without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced.\nVolatility and disruption in the equity and credit markets, whatever the cause, could also adversely affect the portfolio companies in which private markets funds invest, which, in turn, would adversely affect the performance of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts. For example, the lack of available credit or the increased cost of credit may materially and adversely affect the performance of funds that rely heavily on leverage such as leveraged buyout funds. Disruptions in the debt and equity markets may make it more difficult for funds to exit and realize value from their investments, because potential buyers of portfolio companies may not be able to finance acquisitions and the equity markets may become unfavorable for IPOs. In addition, the volatility will directly affect the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the valuation of the investments of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts. Any or all of these factors may result in lower investment returns.\nThe global financial markets continue to experience volatility and disruption due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any economic recovery will likely be uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions. For example, currently high inflation in the United States could continue to increase. Further, heightened competition for workers, supply chain issues and rising energy and commodity prices have contributed to increasing wages and other inputs. Higher inflation and rising input costs may put pressure on the profit margins of portfolio companies within our funds and customized separate accounts, particularly where pricing power is lacking. There can be no assurance that initiatives taken by governmental authorities designed to strengthen and stabilize the economy and financial markets will be successful, and there is no way to predict the ultimate impact of the disruption or the effect that these initiatives will have on the performance of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts or advisory accounts. See \u201c-The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause disruptions in the U.S. and global economies and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\u201d Adding to strain on the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic is Russia\u2019s recent military invasion of Ukraine. In response to Russia\u2019s actions, the United States and several European nations announced sanctions against Russia, which could\nhave a negative impact on the economy and business activity globally, and therefore could adversely affect the performance of our specialized funds, customized separate accounts and advisory accounts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause disruptions in the U.S. and global economies and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 led much of the world to institute stay-at-home orders, restrictions on travel, transportation, education, production of goods, provision of services, bans on public gatherings, the closing of non-essential businesses or limiting their hours of operation and other restrictions on businesses and their operations in an effort to slow the transmission of the virus. These restrictions adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant disruption and uncertainty in the global financial markets, resulting in increased volatility in equity prices (including our common stock), supply chain disruptions and an increase in inflationary pressures, among other things. While restrictions have been relaxed or lifted in many jurisdictions in an effort to generate more economic activity, the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks remains, and jurisdictions may reimpose them in an effort to mitigate risks to public health, especially if more infectious strains of the virus spread. The reinstitution of strict restrictions is particularly more likely in jurisdictions that have a lower tolerance for the spread of COVID-19 and therefore reinforce strict lockdowns and take other measures to stop the infection, such as in China, where recently strict lockdowns have affected the operations of our Hong Kong office and our employees throughout the region. Although a number of vaccines have been developed, the timing of widespread global vaccination is uncertain and these vaccines may be less effective against new, mutated strains of the virus, potentially leading people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Given the amount of uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is currently not possible to predict the precise impact it will have on our business, but it has impacted, and may further impact, our business in various ways, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022We operate our business and target investment opportunities globally, with clients and offices across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. The ability to easily travel and meet with prospective and current clients in person helps build and strengthen our relationships with them in ways that telephone and video conferences may not always afford. Restrictions on travel and gatherings as well as stay-at-home orders that have been in place from time to time over the course of the pandemic meant that most of our client and prospect meetings did not take place in person, and the vast majority of our employees worked from home, for much of the past two years. These conditions have returned or persisted to varying degrees in certain parts of the world depending on a jurisdiction\u2019s tolerance of the spread of COVID-19, including in places where we have offices. As a consequence, our ability to market our funds and raise new business has been impeded (which may result in lower or delayed revenue growth), it became more difficult to conduct due diligence on investments (which can impede the identification of investment risks) and remote working by our employees during this period could have strained our technology resources and introduced operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk, as remote working environments can be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks.\n\u2022A slowdown in fundraising activity could result in delayed or decreased management fees compared to prior periods. In addition, investors may become restricted by their asset allocation policies to invest in new or successor funds that we provide, or may be prohibited by new laws or regulations from funding existing commitments. Further, the uncertainties brought about by the pandemic may cause investors to change their investment strategies or limit the amount of capital they are willing to commit, and that may additionally and negatively affect our ability to raise funds. We may also experience a slowdown in the deployment of our capital, which could also adversely affect our ability to raise capital for new or successor funds.\n\u2022Incentive fee revenue, which is typically volatile and largely unpredictable, has in the past and may in the future decrease as the ability of general partners to exit existing investments may be limited due to uncertainty in the global economic markets.\n\u2022While the market dislocation caused by COVID-19 would be expected to present attractive investment opportunities due to increased volatility in the financial markets, we may not be able to complete those investments, which could impact revenue, particularly for specialized funds and customized separate accounts that charge fees on invested capital.\n\u2022Our liquidity and cash flows may be adversely impacted by declines in realized incentive fees and management fee revenues. As of March 31, 2022, we have adequate liquidity with $72 million in available cash and $50 million in availability under our Loan Agreements.\n\u2022Our specialized funds and customized separate accounts invest in industries that have been, and continue to be, materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including healthcare, travel, entertainment, hospitality and retail. Companies in these industries are facing operational and financial hardships resulting from the pandemic, and if conditions are volatile or do not improve, they could continue to suffer materially, become insolvent or cease operations altogether, any of which would decrease the value of the investments and/or cause significant volatility in valuations. Underlying investments within our specialized funds and customized separate accounts reflect valuations determined as of December 31, 2021. Decreases in public markets and credit indices as well as decreases in current or future estimated performance of underlying portfolio companies in quarters ending after that date may result in negative valuation adjustments that will be reported on a three-month lag in accordance with our accounting policy. Adverse investment valuations directly impact our investments, equity in income of investees, unrealized carried interest, AUM and AUA for the period.\n\u2022COVID-19 presents a threat to our employees\u2019 well-being and morale. If our senior management or other key personnel become ill or are otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time, we may experience a loss of productivity or a delay in the implementation of certain strategic plans. In addition to any potential impact of such extended illness on our operations, we may be exposed to the risk of litigation by our employees against us for, among other things, failure to take adequate steps to protect their well-being, particularly in the event they become sick after a return to the office. A prolonged period of remote work may also make it more difficult to integrate new employees and maintain our culture. Further, local COVID-19-related laws can be subject to rapid change depending on public health developments, which can lead to confusion and make compliance with laws uncertain and subject us to increased risk of litigation for non-compliance.\n\u2022Regulatory oversight and enforcement has become more rigorous for public companies in general, and for the financial services industry in particular, as a result of the volatility in the financial markets.\nThe effects caused by COVID-19 may extend beyond the timeframe of the pandemic itself. We believe COVID-19\u2019s adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations will be significantly driven by a number of factors that we are unable to predict or control, including, for example: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the timing of vaccination of the global population or the availability of treatments for COVID-19; the emergence and spread of variants; the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. and global economies; the timing, scope and effectiveness of additional governmental responses to the pandemic; the timing and path of economic recovery; and the negative impact on our portfolio investments, clients, counterparties, service providers and other business partners that may indirectly adversely affect us. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this Form 10-K.\nExtensive government regulation, compliance failures and changes in law or regulation could adversely affect us.\nOur business activities are subject to extensive and evolving laws, rules and regulations with which we seek to comply. Any changes or potential changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business may impose additional expenses or capital requirements on us, limit our fundraising activities, have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, reputation or prospects, impair employee retention or\nrecruitment and require substantial attention by senior management. The current presidential administration has proposed legislative changes and regulatory reform that may lead to changes in laws and increased regulatory enforcement activity in the financial services industry. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations, initiatives or regulatory guidance that may be proposed or may become law on our business or the markets in which we operate, but they could make it more difficult for us to operate our business.\nGovernmental authorities around the world have implemented or are implementing financial system and participant regulatory reform in reaction to volatility and disruption in the global financial markets, financial institution failures and financial frauds. Such reform includes, among other things, additional regulation of investment funds, as well as their managers and activities, including: compliance, risk management and anti-money laundering procedures; expense allocation policies and practices; restrictions on specific types of investments and the provision and use of leverage; implementation of capital requirements; limitations on compensation to managers; and books and records, reporting and disclosure requirements. We cannot predict with certainty the impact on us, our specialized funds or customized separate accounts, or on private markets funds generally, of any such reforms. Any regulatory reform measures could have an adverse effect on our specialized funds\u2019 and customized separate accounts\u2019 investment strategies or our business model. We may incur significant expense in order to comply with such reform measures and may incur significant liabilities if regulatory authorities determine that we are not in compliance.\nWe could also be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof. The current administration has provided initial guidance on what U.S. tax law reforms the President would support. Among other things, the administration may pursue tax policies seeking to increase the corporate income tax rate, which could materially increase the amount of taxes we would be required to pay. The new administration has also proposed to increase individual ordinary and capital gains tax rates, which would increase the amount of tax distributions that HLA is required to pay to its members. See \u201c-Risks Related to our Organizational Structure-In certain circumstances, HLA is required to make distributions to us and the direct and indirect owners of HLA, and the distributions that HLA will be required to make may be substantial.\u201d Other changes that could be enacted in the future, including changes to tax laws enacted by state or local governments in jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in further changes to state and local taxation and materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate and tax liability are based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner which they apply to us and our funds is sometimes open to interpretation. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. The tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of laws, regulations and treaties, resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. Changes to tax laws may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur advisory and investment management businesses are subject to regulation in the United States, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), FINRA and other regulatory agencies, pursuant to, among other laws, the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act, the Code, the Commodity Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and the Exchange Act. Any change in such regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operating results. For example, the SEC has proposed new rules and amendments under the Investment Advisers Act, which, if finalized in their current forms, would prohibit the imposition or reimbursement of certain fees and expenses customarily charged to private funds or their portfolio investments. If we are no longer able to be reimbursed for such fees and expenses, our revenues may be adversely affected. In addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of these and other applicable laws. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. If, for any reason, these exemptions were to be revoked or challenged or otherwise become unavailable to us, we could be subject to regulatory action or third-party claims, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our\nfailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or regulatory processes could result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration as an investment adviser or the registration of our broker-dealer subsidiary. Even if an investigation does not result in sanctions, or results in a sanction imposed against us or our personnel that is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation or the imposition of sanctions against us by regulators could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients. The requirements imposed by our regulators under the Investment Advisers Act are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect our clients and are not designed to protect our stockholders.\nIn the wake of highly publicized financial scandals, investors exhibited concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets, and the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to further regulation in addition to those rules already promulgated. For example, there are a significant number of regulations that affect our business under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). The SEC in particular continues to increase its regulation of the asset management and private equity industries, focusing on the private equity industry\u2019s fees, allocation of expenses to funds, marketing practices, allocation of fund investment opportunities, disclosures to fund investors, the allocation of broken-deal expenses and general conflicts of interest disclosures. The SEC has also heightened its focus on the valuation practices employed by investment advisers. The lack of readily ascertainable market prices for many of the investments made by our specialized funds or customized separate accounts or the funds in which we invest could subject our valuation policies and processes to increased scrutiny by the SEC. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. Brexit has resulted in our being subject to new and increased regulations now that we can no longer rely on passporting privileges that allow U.K. financial institutions to access the EU single market without restrictions. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations.\nTo the extent that HLA is a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA, with respect to benefit plan clients, it is subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a court could find that one of our direct investment funds has formed a partnership-in-fact conducting a trade or business and would therefore be jointly and severally liable for the portfolio company\u2019s unfunded pension liabilities.\nIn addition, HLA is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and is subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act. Such requirements relate to, among other things, restrictions on entering into transactions with clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, incentive fees, solicitation arrangements, allocation of investments, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an adviser and their advisory clients, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. As a registered investment adviser, HLA has fiduciary duties to its clients. Similarly, our subsidiary, Hamilton Lane Securities, LLC, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and FINRA, and it is subject to their rules and regulations. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Investment Advisers Act, Exchange Act or FINRA rules, including recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in examinations, investigations, sanctions and reputational damage, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act significantly increased the types of transactions that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d). CFIUS has the authority to review and potentially block or impose conditions on certain foreign investments in U.S. companies or real estate, which may reduce the number of potential buyers and limit the ability of our funds to realize value from certain existing and future investments.\nFederal, state and foreign anti-corruption and sanctions laws create the potential for significant liabilities and penalties and reputational harm.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to political persons or other third parties, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as sanctions and export control laws administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State. The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign governments and their officials and political parties, and requires public companies in the United States to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies\u2019 transactions. OFAC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State administer and enforce various export control laws and regulations, including economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including servicing existing fund investors, finding new fund investors, and sourcing new investments, as well as activities by the portfolio companies in our investment portfolio or other controlled investments.\nSimilar laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as EU sanctions or the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, or sanction or other export control laws in the United States and abroad, may also impose stricter or more onerous requirements than the FCPA, OFAC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State, and implementing them may disrupt our business or cause us to incur significantly more costs to comply with those laws. Different laws may also contain conflicting provisions, making compliance with all laws more difficult. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, civil or criminal financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of our employees, restrictions on our operations and other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be subject to successor liability for FCPA violations or other acts of bribery, or violations of applicable sanctions or other export control laws committed by companies in which we or our funds invest or which we or our funds acquire. While we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA and other anti-corruption, sanctions and export control laws in jurisdictions in which we operate, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption, sanctions or export control laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations or the market value of our Class A common stock.\nRegulation of investment advisors outside the United States could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe provide investment advisory and other services and raise funds in a number of countries and jurisdictions outside the United States. In many of these countries and jurisdictions, which include the U.K., the EU, the EEA, certain of the individual member states of each of the EU and EEA, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Japan, we and our operations, and in some cases our personnel, are subject to regulatory oversight and requirements. In general, these requirements relate to registration, licenses for our personnel, periodic inspections, marketing activities, the provision and filing of periodic reports, and obtaining certifications and other approvals. Across the EU, we are subject to the AIFMD, which regulates, among other things, registration for marketing activities, the structure of remuneration for certain of our personnel and reporting obligations. Individual member states of the EU have imposed additional requirements that may include internal arrangements with respect to risk management, liquidity risks, asset valuations, and the establishment and security of depository and custodial requirements. Because some EEA countries have not yet incorporated the AIFMD into their agreement with the EU, we may undertake marketing activities and provide services in those EEA countries only in compliance with applicable local laws. In certain other jurisdictions, we are subject to various securities and other laws relating to fundraising and other matters. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could\nresult in regulatory intervention, adversely affect our business or ability to provide services to our clients and harm our reputation.\nIn the EU, the MiFID II requires, among other things, all MiFID II investment firms to comply with prescriptive disclosure, transparency, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and obligations in relation to the receipt of investment research, best execution, product governance and marketing communications. As we operate investment firms which are subject to MiFID II, we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with MiFID II where relevant, including where certain rules have an extraterritorial impact on us. Compliance with MiFID II has resulted in greater overall complexity, higher compliance, administration and operational costs, and less overall flexibility. The complexity, operational costs and reduction in flexibility may be further compounded as a result of Brexit. This is because the U.K. both: (i) is no longer required to transpose EU law into U.K. law; and (ii) has transposed certain EU legislation into U.K. law subject to various amendments and subject to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s oversight rather than that of EU regulators. Taken together, this could result in divergence between the U.K. and EU regulatory frameworks. Outside the U.K. and EEA, the regulations to which we are subject relate primarily to registration and reporting obligations.\nIn addition, across the EU, we are subject to the AIFMD, under which we are subject to regulatory requirements regarding, among other things, registration for marketing activities, the structure of remuneration for certain of our personnel and reporting obligations. Certain requirements of the AIFMD and the interpretation thereof remain uncertain and may be subject to change as a result of further legislation amending the AIFMD, the issuance of any further national and/or EU guidelines with respect to the AIFMD and the interpretation thereof, and changes to national implementing legislation in relevant EEA countries or in the U.K. Brexit and the potential resulting divergence between the U.K. and EU regulatory frameworks may result in additional complexity and costs in complying with AIFMD across both the U.K. and EU.\nIt is expected that additional laws and regulations will come into force in the U.K., EEA, the EU, and other countries in which we operate over the coming years. Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 on the prudential requirements for investment firms (\u201cIFR\u201d) and Directive (EU) 2019/2034 on the prudential supervision of investment firms (\u201cIFD\u201d) took effect on June 26, 2021. Together, the IFR and IFD introduced a new prudential regime for those of our EU investment firms that are subject to MiFID II, including new requirements, such as general capital requirements, liquidity requirements, remuneration requirements, requirements to conduct internal capital adequacy assessments and additional requirements on disclosures and public reporting. The legislation could hinder our ability to deploy capital as freely as we would wish and to recruit and incentivize staff. Different and extended internal governance, disclosure, reporting, liquidity and group \u201cprudential\u201d consolidation requirements (among other things) could also have a material impact on our EU-based operations. Further, the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU and the resulting divergence between the U.K. and EU regulatory frameworks may result in additional complexity and costs in complying with regulations across both the U.K. and EU. The U.K. established its own, new prudential regime for investment firms that are subject to MiFID II (as implemented in the U.K.), which took effect on January 1, 2022 and is intended to achieve similar outcomes to the IFR and IFD. The exact impact of the new U.K. prudential regime is currently uncertain.\nThese laws and regulations, and any changes in them, may affect our costs and manner of conducting business in one or more markets, the risks of doing business, the assets that we manage or advise, and our ability to raise capital from investors. In addition, Brexit may have adverse economic, political and regulatory effects on the operation of our business. Any failure by us to comply with either existing or new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to continue to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nHolders of our Class B common stock, which is not publicly traded, control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that (i) a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) director nominees be selected or recommended to the board by independent directors and (iii) we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nAlthough independent directors comprise the majority of our board of directors, we have elected to rely on these exemptions and expect to continue to do so. As a result, our directors are not nominated or selected by independent directors and our compensation committee does not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nOur only material asset is our interest in HLA, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from HLA to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses.\nHLI is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of membership units in HLA and certain deferred tax assets. As such, HLI does not have any independent means of generating revenue. We intend to cause HLA to make pro rata distributions to its members, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the tax receivable agreement we have entered into with the direct and indirect members of HLA, and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses. To the extent that HLI needs funds, and HLA is restricted from making such distributions under applicable laws or regulations, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe IRS might challenge the tax basis step-up we received in connection with our IPO and the related transactions and in connection with subsequent acquisitions of membership units in HLA.\nWe have used a portion of the proceeds from our IPO and from subsequent registered offerings to purchase membership units in HLA from certain of the legacy direct or indirect members of HLA, which resulted in an increase in our share of the tax basis of the assets of HLA that otherwise would not have been available. The HLA membership units held directly and indirectly by the members of HLA other than HLI, including members of our senior management team, may in the future be exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock or, at our election, for cash. These exchanges are likely to result in increases in our share of the tax basis of the assets of HLA that otherwise would not have been available. The increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although it is possible that the IRS might challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court might sustain such a challenge. Our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed below, including the timing and amount of our future income.\nWe are required to pay over to legacy direct or indirect members of HLA most of the tax benefits we receive from tax basis step-ups attributable to our acquisition of membership units of HLA, and the amount of those payments could be substantial.\nAs part of our Reorganization, we entered into a tax receivable agreement for the benefit of the direct and indirect members of HLA other than us, pursuant to which we will pay them 85% of the amount of the tax savings, if any, that we realize (or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize) as a result of increases\nin tax basis (and certain other tax benefits) resulting from our acquisition of membership units or as a result of certain items of loss being specially allocated to us for tax purposes in connection with dispositions by HLA of certain investment assets. HLI will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these tax savings.\nThe term of the tax receivable agreement commenced upon the completion of our IPO and will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement have been utilized or have expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the tax receivable agreement (or the tax receivable agreement is terminated due to a change of control or our breach of a material obligation thereunder), in which case, we will be required to make the termination payment specified in the tax receivable agreement. In addition, payments we make under the tax receivable agreement will be increased by any interest accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return.\nThe actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the purchase or exchange, the timing of any future exchanges, the extent to which exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable. We expect that, as a result of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of HLA attributable to the exchanged HLA interests, the payments that we may make to the legacy direct or indirect members of HLA could be substantial. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as described below, the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual benefits we receive in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and/or distributions to us by HLA are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nIn certain circumstances, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual tax benefits we realize.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that if we exercise our right to early termination of the tax receivable agreement, in whole or in part, we experience a change in control, or we materially breach our obligations under the tax receivable agreement, we will be obligated to make an early termination payment to the legacy direct or indirect members of HLA equal to the net present value of all payments that would be required to be paid by us under the tax receivable agreement. The amount of such payments will be determined on the basis of certain assumptions in the tax receivable agreement, including (i) the assumption (except in the case of a partial termination) that we would have enough taxable income in the future to fully utilize the tax benefit resulting from any increased tax basis that results from an exchange and (ii) the assumption that any units (other than those held by Hamilton Lane Incorporated) outstanding on the termination date are deemed to be exchanged for shares of Class A common stock on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the termination payment relates.\nMoreover, as a result of an elective early termination, a change of control or our material breach of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement, we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that exceed our actual cash savings under the tax receivable agreement. Thus, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combinations or changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance any such early termination payment. It is also possible that the actual benefits ultimately realized by us may be significantly less than were projected in the computation of the early termination payment.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if the basis increases described above are successfully challenged by the IRS or another taxing authority. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our ultimate cash tax savings.\nIn certain circumstances, HLA is required to make distributions to us and the direct and indirect owners of HLA, and the distributions that HLA will be required to make may be substantial.\nHLA is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to members, including us. Pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of HLA (\u201cHLA Operating Agreement\u201d), HLA makes pro rata cash distributions, or tax distributions, to the members, including us, calculated using an assumed tax rate, to help each of the members to pay taxes on such member\u2019s allocable share of taxable income. Under applicable tax rules, HLA is required to allocate net taxable income disproportionately to its members in certain circumstances. Because tax distributions are based on an assumed tax rate that is the highest possible rate applicable to any member, HLA is required to make tax distributions that, in the aggregate, will likely exceed the amount of taxes that HLA would have paid if it were taxed on its net income at the assumed rate. The pro rata distribution amounts will also be increased if and to the extent necessary to ensure that the amount distributed to HLI is sufficient to enable HLI to pay its actual tax liabilities and its other expenses and costs (including amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement).\nFunds used by HLA to satisfy its tax distribution obligations are not available for reinvestment in our business. Moreover, the tax distributions HLA is required to make may be substantial, and may exceed (as a percentage of HLA\u2019s income) the overall effective tax rate applicable to a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. In addition, because these payments are calculated with reference to an assumed tax rate, and because of the disproportionate allocation of net taxable income, these payments will likely significantly exceed the actual tax liability for many of the legacy owners of HLA.\nAs a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to the direct and indirect owners of HLA, (ii) the lower tax rate applicable to corporations than individuals and (iii) the use of an assumed tax rate in calculating HLA\u2019s distribution obligations, we may receive distributions significantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the tax receivable agreement. If we do not distribute such cash balances as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to HLA, the existing owners of HLA would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances as a result of their right to acquire shares of Class A common stock or, at our election, an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof, in exchange for their Class B units or Class C units.\nBecause most members of our senior management team hold most of their economic interest in HLA through other entities, conflicts of interest may arise between them and holders of shares of our Class A common stock or us.\nBecause most members of our senior management team hold most of their economic interest in HLA directly through holding companies and other vehicles rather than through ownership of shares of our Class A common stock, they may have interests that do not align with, or conflict with, those of the holders of Class A common stock or with us. For example, members of our senior management team have different tax positions from Class A common stockholders, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when we should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate the obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions and investments may take into consideration the members\u2019 tax considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us.\nThe disparity in the voting rights among the classes of our common stock and inability of the holders of our Class A common stock to influence decisions submitted to a vote of our stockholders may have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock.\nHolders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on almost all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitle the respective holders to identical non-economic rights, except that each share of our Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally, while each share of our Class B common stock entitles its holder to ten votes until a Sunset becomes\neffective. See \u201cOrganizational Structure-Class A and Class B Common Stock.\u201d After a Sunset becomes effective, each share of our Class B common stock will entitle its holder to one vote. Certain of the holders of our Class B common stock who are significant outside investors, members of management and significant employee owners have agreed to vote all of their shares in accordance with the instructions of HLAI, and will therefore be able to exercise control over all matters requiring our stockholders\u2019 approval, including the election of our directors, as well as any significant corporate transactions. The difference in voting rights could adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock to the extent that investors view, or any potential future purchaser of our Company views, the superior voting rights and implicit control of the Class B common stock to have value.\nOur share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale and for exchange.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Shares of Class A common stock that were issued in the Reorganization to the original members of HLA who became HLI stockholders owning our Class A common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d, and their resale is subject to future registration or reliance on an exemption from registration.\nThe approximately 16.7 million shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of the Class B units and Class C units that are held by Class B Holders and Class C Holders will be eligible for resale from time to time, subject to certain exchange timing and volume and Securities Act restrictions.\nWe have entered into a registration rights agreement with certain Class B Holders who are significant outside investors, members of management and significant employee owners. Under that agreement, subject to certain limitations, those persons have the ability to cause us to register the resale of shares of our Class A common stock that they acquire upon exchange of their Class B units and Class C units in HLA. Registration of these shares would result in them becoming freely tradable in the open market unless restrictions apply.\nWe expect to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders, but our ability to do so is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of Delaware and Pennsylvania law.\nSince our IPO, our board of directors has declared regular quarterly dividends on our Class A common stock. Although we expect to continue to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, our board of directors may, in its discretion, increase or decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, as a holding company, we are dependent upon the ability of HLA to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us so that we may pay our obligations and expenses (including our taxes and payments under the tax receivable agreement) and pay dividends to our stockholders. We expect to cause HLA to make distributions to its members, including us. However, the ability of HLA to make such distributions will be subject to its operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, restrictive covenants in the Loan Agreements and applicable Pennsylvania law (which may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to its members). Our ability to declare and pay dividends to our stockholders is likewise subject to Delaware law (which may limit the amount of funds available for dividends). If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we are unable to generate sufficient distributions from our business, we may not be able to make, or may be required to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022 provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022 establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022 require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent, except that action by written consent will be allowed for as long as we are a controlled company;\n\u2022 specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors or the chairman of our board of directors;\n\u2022 establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; and\n\u2022 reflect two classes of common stock, as discussed above.\nThese and other provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Also, the tax receivable agreement provides that, in the event of a change of control, we will be required to make a payment equal to the present value of estimated future payments under the tax receivable agreement, which would result in a significant payment becoming due in the event of a change of control. In addition, we are a Delaware corporation and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. While we have elected in our certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the DGCL, except that they provide that HLAI, its affiliates, groups that include HLAI and certain of their direct and indirect transferees will not be deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them, and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.\nThe provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (5) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing\nincreased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nIf Hamilton Lane Incorporated were deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act as a result of its ownership of HLA, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn issuer will generally be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act if:\n\u2022 it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or\n\u2022 absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nWe believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing asset management services and not in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We also believe that the primary source of income from our business is properly characterized as income earned in exchange for the provision of services. We hold ourselves out as an asset management firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that either Hamilton Lane Incorporated or HLA is an \u201corthodox\u201d investment company as defined in section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act and described in the first bullet point above. HLA does not have significant assets other than its equity interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries, which in turn have no significant assets other than general partner interests in the specialized funds we sponsor. These wholly owned subsidiaries are the sole general partners of the funds and are vested with all management and control over the funds. We do not believe the equity interests of HLA in its wholly owned subsidiaries or the general partner interests of these wholly owned subsidiaries in the funds are investment securities. Hamilton Lane Incorporated\u2019s unconsolidated assets consist primarily of cash, a deferred tax asset and Class A units of HLA, which represent the managing member interest in HLA. Hamilton Lane Incorporated is the sole managing member of HLA and holds an approximately 68.9% economic interest in HLA. As managing member, Hamilton Lane Incorporated exercises complete control over HLA. As such, we do not believe Hamilton Lane Incorporated\u2019s managing member interest in HLA is an investment security. Therefore, we believe that less than 40% of Hamilton Lane Incorporated\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis comprise assets that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, we do not believe Hamilton Lane Incorporated is an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% test in section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act as described in the second bullet point above. In addition, we believe Hamilton Lane Incorporated is not an investment company under section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because it is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the issuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that Hamilton Lane Incorporated will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if anything were to happen that would cause Hamilton Lane Incorporated to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, requirements imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates (including HLA) and ability to compensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among HLA, us or our senior management team, or any combination thereof and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA change of control of our Company, including the occurrence of a \u201cSunset,\u201d could result in an assignment of our investment advisory agreements.\nUnder the Investment Advisers Act, each of the investment advisory agreements for the funds and other accounts we manage must provide that it may not be assigned without the consent of the particular fund or other client. An assignment may occur under the Investment Advisers Act if, among other things, HLA undergoes a change of control. After a \u201cSunset\u201d becomes effective (as described in \u201cOrganizational Structure-Class A and Class B Common Stock-Voting Rights\u201d), the Class B Common Stock will have one vote per share instead of ten votes per share, and the stockholders agreement will expire, meaning that the Class B Holders party thereto will no longer control the appointment of directors or be able to direct the vote on all matters that are submitted to our stockholders for a vote. These events could be deemed a change of control of HLA, and thus an assignment. If such an assignment occurs, we cannot be certain that HLA will be able to obtain the necessary consents from our funds and other clients, which could cause us to lose the management fees and performance fees we earn from such funds and other clients.", "PERMNO": 16632, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "HLNE"}
