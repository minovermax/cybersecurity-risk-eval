{"cik": "1534708", "company": "Eastside Distilling, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our other disclosures in this Annual Report. We may have other risks that we have not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial but may become material.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nInternal disagreements of our Board of Directors could have materially adverse consequences\nWe have a dynamic board of directors consisting of independent and non-independent members. Our board seeks to stimulate the flow of ideas, identify key issues, consider alternatives, and make informed decisions through a deliberative process. Our directors have a diverse range of experiences and perspectives. In some cases, our directors have actual or possible conflicts of interests or have financial or other interests in proposed transactions with the Company. As a result of all of these factors, members of our board of directors may disagree on how to oversee the business of the Company, the Company\u2019s long-term strategic, financial, or organizational goals, the Company\u2019s standards and policies, or other Company matters.\nThese disagreements can evolve into disputes, and some of these disputes may have adverse consequences, including a reduced level of trust among board members, unresolved issues, an inability to act on corporate matters, instability on the board, and reduced management and employee morale. They can also significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or have an adverse impact on our business performance. In some cases, if disputes cannot be resolved internally, they can result in director resignation or removal, proxy contests, litigation, or stock market delisting.\nFailure to retain & recruit executive management and to build morale and performance\nEastside Distilling\u2019s success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive management team, key senior management, and a high-quality employee base, as well as our ability to attract, motivate, reward, and retain them. If one of our executive officers or critical senior management terminates his or her employment, we may not be able to replace their expertise, fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships. The loss of critical employees might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in our industry that we require are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key executive or employee talent, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees could have an adverse impact on our business performance. In addition, we could experience business disruption and/or increased costs related to organizational changes, reductions in workforce, or other cost-cutting measures.\nWe recently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. Both our corporate controller and Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis resigned effective December 2020 due to concerns of stability, functionality, and over-reaching Board involvement. This has been a significant set-back to the Company. We have recently recruited two new employees to fill these roles and we are currently on-boarding in the first quarter 2021.\nThere is substantial uncertainty relating to our acquisition of the assets of Intersect Beverage, LLC\nOn September 12, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of the Azu\u00f1ia Tequila brand, the direct sales team, existing product inventory, supply chain relationships and contractual agreements from Intersect Beverage, LLC, an importer and distributor of tequila and related products. We have encountered integration difficulties since the acquisition, including difficulties in assimilating the operations and products, failing to realize synergies, unanticipated costs, low profit margins, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and issues relating to employee transition. Moreover, the Company has discovered a number of inappropriate and problematic trade and sales practices relating to the Company\u2019s sales of the Azu\u00f1ia Tequila brand of products. The Company has commenced an internal investigation into these trade practices and the effects, if any, such practices may have on the Company\u2019s historical results of operation, as well as any potential violation of laws or regulations applicable to the Company. The results of the investigation could lead to one or more material adverse effects on the Company, including actions for violation of law or regulation, penalties or other monetary liability, suspension, or forfeiture of one or more licenses to operate our business. Moreover, the investigation may result in assertion of one or more claims of indemnification or other legal action arising out of the acquisition.\nNegative impact of COVID-19 pandemic\nOur business continues to be susceptible to disruption from any number of current and ongoing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of consumer business and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the operations and financial condition of many businesses. Those include employees being required to work remotely, not travel and otherwise alter their normal working conditions. For instance, our sales staff have had limited opportunity to interact with customers. Businesses have been closed, including establishments that sell our products, and supply chains and manufacturing have been disrupted. Consumer buying habits have shifted and may continue to shift, which may result in fewer sales of our products. These and other impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and any other similar crisis could have a material impact on our operations and financial results.\nIn addition, our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal or state legislation (or other similar laws, regulations, orders or other governmental or regulatory actions) that would impose new or more severe restrictions on our ability to operate our business or impact the economy or our customers and suppliers, a severe downturn in the economy or financial and lending markets.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 may impact our results of operations and financial condition is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including the ultimate severity and the duration of the pandemic, and further actions that may be taken by governmental authorities or businesses or individuals on their own initiatives in response to the pandemic.\nNegative impact of operating losses every quarter since our inception\nWe believe that we will continue to incur net losses in 2021 as we expect to make continued investment in product development, sales and marketing, brand support and to incur administrative expenses as we seek to grow our brands. We also anticipate that our cash needs will exceed our income from sales in 2021. Some of our products may not achieve widespread market acceptance and may not generate sales and profits to justify our investment in them. We expect we will continue to experience losses and negative cash flow. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including new entrants, competitive activity, government regulations and increase in tax. We also incur substantial operating expenses at the corporate level, including costs directly related to being a reporting company with the SEC.\nFailure to secure additional capital and achieve adequate liquidity to grow and compete\nWe will require additional capital to operate, grow and compete, and failure to obtain such additional capital could limit our operations and our growth. Unfortunately, we have not generated sufficient cash from operations to finance additional capital needs, and we will need to raise additional funds through private or public equity and/or debt financing. We cannot assure that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is either unavailable or cost prohibitive, our operations and growth may be limited, and we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of, or eliminate, our expansion or to reduce or curtail our operations. Also, any additional financing we undertake could impose covenants upon us that restrict our operating flexibility, and, if we issue equity securities to raise capital, our existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nFailure to effectively manage debt\nWe have incurred significant debt under promissory notes and inventory financing lines. Much of our debt is secured by our bulk spirit inventory and other assets, including assets in our Craft Canning business. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon our operating and financial performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt, we may need to sell inventory and other material assets, restructure or refinance our debt, or seek additional equity capital. Prevailing economic conditions and global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to do so.\nOur debt agreements contain limits on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, make investments, and dispose of inventory. We are also required to maintain compliance with a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and for our secured inventory to have a market value relative to our outstanding debt balance.\nThe amount and terms of our debt, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf prematurely pay down our outstanding debt balance if the market value of our bulk spirits falls and we need to remain within our borrowing base covenants;\n\u25cf we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u25cf we may be more limited in our ability to execute on our strategy and have flexibility to operate or restructure our business;\n\u25cf our cash flow from operations may be allocated to the payment of outstanding debt and not to developing and growing our brands;\n\u25cf we might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the facility and to fund other liquidity needs;\n\u25cf an inability to incur additional debt, including for working capital, acquisitions, or other needs.\nIf we breach a loan covenant or miss a payment, the lenders could accelerate the repayment of debt and foreclose on our inventory and other assets. We might not have sufficient assets to repay our debt upon acceleration. If we are unable to repay or refinance the debt upon acceleration or at maturity, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection proceedings with respect to our assets securing the facility, which could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nFailure of our brands to achieve anticipated consumer acceptance, sales, growth, or profitability.\nAlthough our brands continue to achieve acceptance, most of our brands are relatively new and have not achieved national brand recognition. We have not yet had success growing a brand to a sufficient level to realize profitability and be in a position to sell the brand for a profit. Also, brands we may develop and/or acquire in the future may not establish widespread brand recognition. Accordingly, if consumers do not accept our brands at scale, our sales will be limited, and we will not be able to penetrate our markets. Our profitability depends in part on achieving scale. We will need to achieve wider market acceptance of our brands and materially increase sales to achieve profitability.\nFailure to obtain satisfactory performance from our suppliers or loss of our existing suppliers\nOther than our long-term exclusive agreement with Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan, SA. de CV (\u201cAgaveros Unidos\u201d) for the Azu\u00f1ia Tequila brand, we do not have long-term, written agreements with any of our suppliers. The termination of our relationships or an adverse change in the terms of these arrangements (including with Agaveros Unidos) could have a negative impact on our business. If our suppliers increase their prices, we may not be able to secure alternative suppliers, and may not be able to raise the prices of our products to cover all or even a portion of the increased costs. Also, our suppliers\u2019 failure to perform satisfactorily or handle increased orders, delays in shipments of products from suppliers or the loss of our existing suppliers, especially our key suppliers, could cause us to fail to meet orders for our products, lose sales, incur additional costs and/or expose us to product quality issues. In turn, this could cause us to lose credibility in the marketplace and damage our relationships with distributors, ultimately leading to a decline in our business and results of operations. If we are not able to renegotiate these contracts on acceptable terms or find suitable alternatives, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe have yet to assume the Intersect Beverage, LLC contract with Agaveros Unidos, which we are renegotiating. That contract runs through July 2039 and has set pricing for the tequila and bottling services Agaveros Unidos provides. The contract also includes an exclusivity clause. We are committed to purchase 24,000 9-liter cases in 2020 and 35,000 9-liter cases in 2021. We have no expressed commitments beyond 2021. A breach of this contract, including minimum purchase commitments, could lead to a $2 million penalty and termination of the contract, and result in a failure of the Azu\u00f1ia Tequila brand. We are currently evaluating our options relating to amending and renegotiating the contract.\nFailure of our distributors to distribute our products adequately within their territories\nWe are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in 17 states known as \u201ccontrol states,\u201d state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our products to retail outlets, including liquor stores, bars, restaurants and national chains in the United States. We have established relationships for our brands with a limited number of wholesale distributors; however, failure to maintain those relationships could significantly and adversely affect our business, sales and growth. We currently distribute our products in 49 states.\nOver the past decade there has been increasing consolidation, both intrastate and interstate, among distributors. As a result, many states now have only two or three significant distributors. Also, there are several distributors that now control distribution for several states. If we fail to maintain good relations with a distributor, our products could, in some instances be frozen out of one or more markets entirely. The ultimate success of our products also depends in large part on our distributors\u2019 ability and desire to distribute our products to our desired U.S. target markets, as we rely significantly on them for product placement and retail store penetration. In addition, all of our distributors also distribute competitive brands and product lines. We cannot assure you that our U.S. distributors will continue to purchase our products, commit sufficient time and resources to promote and market our brands and product lines, or that they can or will sell them to our desired or targeted markets. If they do not, our sales will be harmed, resulting in a decline in our results of operations.\nFailure of our products to secure and maintain listings in the control states\nIn the control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products selected for listing in control states must generally reach certain volumes and/or profit levels to maintain their listings. Products in control states are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures, which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not selected for listings can only be purchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders, if at all. If, in the future, we are unable to maintain our current listings in the control states, or secure and maintain listings in those states for any additional products we may develop or acquire, sales of our products could decrease significantly, which would have a material adverse financial effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain adequate inventory levels\nWe maintain relatively large inventories of our product aging in barrels, as well as, to meet customer delivery requirements. We have used our barreled spirits inventory at market value as collateral in our financing. If we do not make timely payments on our financing obligations, or we breach our covenants in any financing document, including maintaining loan-to-value ratios, the lenders may foreclose and take possession of our inventory. In addition, this inventory is always at risk of loss due to theft, fire, evaporation, spoilage, or other damage, and any such loss, whether insured against or not, could cause us to fail to meet our orders and harm our sales and operating results. Also, our inventory may become obsolete as we introduce new products, cease to produce old products or modify the design of our products\u2019 packaging, which would increase our operating losses and negatively impact our results of operations.\nFailure to acquire additional distilleries, brands, or products that are complementary to our existing portfolio\nA component of our growth strategy may be the acquisition of additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio through the acquisition of such brands or their corporate owners, directly as brand acquisitions or through mergers, joint ventures, long-term exclusive distribution arrangements and/or other strategic relationships. For example, in September 2019, we acquired the high-end, luxury tequila brand, Azu\u00f1ia, to complement our portfolio and provide us with a brand in the high-growth tequila category. In addition, we acquired MotherLode in March 2017, which provides contract canning, bottling and packaging services for existing and emerging spirits producers, and in January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Craft Canning, which significantly adds to our contract canning, bottling and packaging services. If we are unable to identify or have the financial ability to acquire suitable brand candidates and successfully execute our acquisition strategy, our growth will be limited. In addition, our entry into and expansion of our contract bottling, canning, and packaging services as a result of our acquisitions of MotherLode and Craft Canning may not be successful, and we may not realize the benefits of these co-packing operations and may face certain risks, including safety concerns, product contamination, and equipment malfunctions or breakdowns, among other things associated with our manufacturing operations. In addition, if our bottling, canning, or packaging services fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, or there is an overall decline in demand for bottling, canning, or packaging services, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are successful in acquiring additional brands or related service businesses, we may still fail to achieve our target margins or maintain profitability levels that would justify our investment in those additional brands or services or fail to realize operating and economic efficiencies or other planned benefits with respect to those additional brands or services. For Craft Canning, we will need to provide increased capital to expand operations and for Azu\u00f1ia Tequila we will need to increase our gross profit margins substantially, grow sales, reduce cost and leverage distribution to become cash flow positive.\nThe addition of new products or businesses entails numerous risks with respect to integration and other operating issues, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including failure to realize synergies;\n\u25cf failure to realize or anticipate benefits or to execute on our planned strategy for the acquired brand or business;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs that could materially adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u25cf negative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, distributors and retail customers;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets or markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u25cf the potential inability to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses.\nOur ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands is also dependent upon identifying acceptable acquisition targets and opportunities, our ability to consummate prospective transactions on favorable terms, or at all, and the availability of capital to complete the necessary acquisition arrangements. We intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources, third-party financing and, in appropriate circumstances, the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results. Also, acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on our financial statements, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce reported earnings in subsequent years.\nFailure to protect our trademarks and trade secrets\nOur business and prospects depend in part on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of our brands and trademarks. Although we apply for registration of our brands and trademarks, they could be imitated in ways that we cannot prevent. Also, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, concepts and formulas. Our methods of protecting this information may not be adequate. Moreover, we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties\u2019 rights that could interfere with our use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and, if unsuccessful, may prevent us from continuing to use this proprietary information in the future and result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us. We do not maintain non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel or with some of our key suppliers. If competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our trade secrets, proprietary know-how or recipes, the appeal, and thus the value, of our brand portfolio could be reduced, negatively impacting our sales and growth potential.\nFailure of our key or service product information technology systems, cyber-security breach or cyber-related fraud\nWe rely on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices), and software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist us in the management of our business.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks, and services, as well as to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely affect our business operations and/or financial condition. In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, our employees, customers, suppliers, or consumers. In any of these events, we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems.\nNegative impact of litigation and litigation risks\nFrom time to time, we become involved in various litigation matters and claims, including employment, regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, and contract disputes. We face potential claims or liability for, among other things, breach of contract, defamation, libel, fraud, or negligence. We may also face employment-related litigation, including claims of age discrimination, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, immigration violations, or other local, state, and federal labor law violations. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and insurance coverage decisions, the outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, reputation, brand identity and the trading price of our securities. Any such litigation, with or without merit, could also result in substantial expenditures of time and money, and divert attention of our management team from other tasks important to the success of our business.\nOn December 15, 2020, Grover Wickersham filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District Court of Oregon against the Company. Mr. Wickersham, the former CEO and Chairman of the Board of the Company, has asserted causes of action for fraud in the inducement, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, interference with economic advantage, elder financial abuse, and dissemination of false and misleading proxy materials The Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend the case vigorously.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in category trends and consumer preferences\nConsumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic and social trends, public health initiatives, product innovations, changes in vacation or leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns and a downturn in economic conditions, any or all of which may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences toward beer, wine or non-alcoholic beverages or other products. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations.\nIn addition, the legalization of marijuana in any of the jurisdictions in which we sell our products may result in a reduction in sales. Studies have shown that sales of alcohol may decrease in jurisdictions where marijuana has been legalized (e.g. Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia). As a result, marijuana sales may adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in our industry\nWe compete on the basis of product taste and quality, brand image, price, service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences. The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large, well-funded international companies. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as larger installed customer bases, greater name recognition and broader product offerings. Some of these competitors can devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. As a result, it is possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition to sustain market share, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nClass actions or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol\nOur industry faces the possibility of class action or similar litigation alleging that the continued excessive use or abuse of beverage alcohol has caused death or serious health problems or related to the labelling of our products. It is also possible that governments could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government-funded healthcare costs. Litigation or assertions of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry, and it is possible that we, as well as our suppliers, could be named in litigation of this type.\nAlso, lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants\u2019 advertisements, marketing and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits, we could be named in similar lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend against, depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and, if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail, our business could be harmed significantly.\nRegulatory decisions and legal, regulatory and tax changes\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation. This may include regulations regarding production, distribution, marketing, advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover, because these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation, we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally, due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems, including driving while intoxicated, underage drinking, alcoholism and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol, various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties, suspension or even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm our business, as we could find it necessary to raise our prices in order to maintain profit margins, which could lower the demand for our products and reduce our sales and profit potential.\nAlso, the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation (at both the federal and state government levels), and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly harm our sales revenue and margins, both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol. Although we expect a significantly positive impact on our operating results from the enactment of the Craft Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2017, which was part of the 2017 federal tax legislation that went into effect on January 1, 2018, resulting from the lowering of the federal excise tax on spirits for the first 100,000 proof gallons per year from $13.34 to $2.70 per gallon.\nProduct liability or other related liabilities\nAlthough we maintain liability insurance and will attempt to limit contractually our liability for damages arising from our products, these measures may not be sufficient for us to successfully avoid or limit product liability or other related liabilities. Our product liability insurance coverage is limited to $2 million per occurrence and $5 million in the aggregate and our general liability umbrella policy is capped at $2 million, which may be insufficient. Further, any contractual indemnification and insurance coverage we have from parties supplying our products is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by these suppliers. In any event, extensive product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation or business.\nContamination of our products and/or counterfeit or confusingly similar products\nThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them. Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could affect the demand for our products. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our products or defects in the distillation and fermentation processes could lead to low beverage quality, as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and could result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands and potentially serious damage to our reputation for product quality, as well as product liability claims. Also, to the extent that third parties sell products that are either counterfeit versions of our brands or brands that look like our brands, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales and operations.\nIn addition, we also provide contract bottling, canning, and packaging services for existing and emerging beer, wine and spirits producers through our subsidiaries MotherLode and Craft Canning. Beer and wine products produced by third parties may be more susceptible to contamination than the distilled products that we produce, due to the lower alcohol content.\nAdverse public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products\nAnti-alcohol groups have, in the past, advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements, higher taxes and other regulations designed to discourage alcohol consumption. In addition, recent developments in the industry may compel us to identify the source and location of our distillate products and notify the consumer of whether the product was distilled by us. More restrictive regulations, negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could, in turn, significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue growth, causing a decline in our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and investors may be unable to sell some or all of their shares\nOur common stock has historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Investors may be unable to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. Also, as a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could, for example, decline if a large number of shares of our common stock is sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer that could better absorb such sales without adverse impact on its share price.\nSales of our stock or use of our common stock to satisfy obligations may impact the market price and cause substantial dilution\nWe will need to raise additional capital, which might be in the form of an equity offering. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock, including shares that we may issue upon exercise of warrants or conversion of preferred stock, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and cause substantial dilution to current stockholders.\nWe pay certain of our directors, consultants and business partners in our common stock or other securities linked to our common stock, and sometimes settle debts with common stock. We also pay executive compensation in the form of equity. These payments are based on the dollar value of what is owed, rather than a fixed number of shares. Continued use of our stock in this manner, especially if our stock price is trading at a low price, may cause dilution to our shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise working capital\nA further decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. A decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new services and continue our current operations. If our common stock price further declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting\nIn August 2017, our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements. As of August 8, 2019, we failed to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s requirement to have a majority independent Board and independent audit and compensation committees. Although we regained compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements in September 2019, we again fell out of compliance on November 12, 2019 due to a director resignation and the appointment of Lawrence Firestone, a then-independent director, as our Chief Executive Officer. We promptly came back into compliance on November 18, 2019.\nOn August 20, 2020, Nasdaq notified the Company that it no longer complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) because its reported stockholder\u2019s equity of $2.4 million as of June 30, 2020 was below the minimum stockholder\u2019s equity of $2.5 million set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule by $0.1 million. The Company believes it has regained compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity requirement based upon the specific transactions and events as of February 16, 2021. Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company\u2019s ongoing compliance with the stockholders\u2019 equity requirement and, if, the Company does not evidence compliance at the time of its next periodic report, the Company may be subject to delisting.\nOn January 19, 2021, our board of directors determined that one of its members, Stephanie Kilkenny, had ceased to be independent due to circumstances beyond her reasonable control resulting in our non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(b), (c), and (d). The Board resolved to regain compliance and take commercially reasonable steps, including retaining an executive search firm, to fill a current vacancy on the Board with a new director who qualifies as independent under these rules as soon as possible but in no event later than the earlier of our next annual shareholder meeting or 180 days from the date of determination. On March 22, 2021, our Board of Directors unanimously consented to a new independent board member bringing us back into compliance.\nWhile our warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital\nWe currently have non-trading, privately issued common stock warrants to purchase 240,278 shares of common stock. During the term that our warrants are outstanding, the holders of the warrants will be given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while we have warrants outstanding. We might issue additional warrants along with a future financing.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future\nFor the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that earnings, if any, that may be generated from our operations will be used to finance our operations and that cash dividends will not be paid to holders of common stock.\nOur largest stockholders\u2019 interests may conflict with the company or our smaller shareholders\nWe have several stockholders owning near or over 5% of our outstanding common stock, according to public filings. In addition, Stephanie Kilkenny, a member of our Board of Directors together with her spouse, owns and controls TQLA, LLC (\u201cTQLA\u201d), the majority owner of Intersect Beverage, LLC. In connection with the acquisition of Azu\u00f1ia Tequila from Intersect Beverage, LLC, TQLA received a substantial number of shares payable under the asset purchase agreement in 2021, subject to a limitation under Nasdaq rules if the share issuance would require a shareholder vote (e.g., we anticipate that the share issuance will be limited 19.99% of our outstanding). Certain officers, such as our CEO, Mr. Block and CFO, Mr. Gwin may become significant stockholders through the payment of equity compensation.\nAccordingly, as a result of their direct and indirect beneficial ownership, the foregoing stockholders may be able to exercise substantial control and more directly influence our affairs and business, including any determination with respect to a change in control, future issuances of common stock or other securities, declaration of dividends on the common stock and the election of directors. The stockholders may have interests that differ from the interests of other stockholders.\nIssuing additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock could cause dilution\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board to issue up to 15 million shares of common stock and up to 100 million shares of preferred stock. The power of the Board to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, any additional issuances of our common stock, or preferred stock that may be convertible into common stock, may have the effect of diluting your investment, and the new securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nWe have over 11 million shares of common stock outstanding or subject to warrants or other convertible securities. We are limited to issuing up to 15 million shares of common stock. The limited number of available shares of common stock constrains our ability to conduct equity offerings or engage in financing transactions that may have an equity component. In addition, this limitation will constrain our ability to grant equity incentives, which could result in a failure to align management to shareholder objectives or to be able to retain and motivate key personnel.\nBy issuing preferred stock, we may adversely affect the market price and voting rights of common shareholders\nOur Articles of Incorporation permit us to issue, without approval from our stockholders, a total of 100 million shares of preferred stock. Our Board may determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed upon, the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series. It is possible that our Board, in determining the rights, preferences and privileges to be granted when the preferred stock is issued, may include provisions that have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, or that adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe face risks related to compliance with corporate governance laws and financial reporting standards\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), as well as related rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, require compliance with certain corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies. These laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 relating to internal control over financial reporting (\u201cSOX 404\u201d), has materially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming, burdensome and expensive. Although we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate or may not operate effectively. Any failure to comply with the requirements of SOX 404, our ability to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify during our compliance program, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations of our internal controls and, in the case of a failure to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, would adversely affect the annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required under SOX 404. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.", "PERMNO": 16887, "SIC": 2085, "TIC": "EAST"}
