{"cik": "1007330", "company": "PRGX GLOBAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe must successfully execute our growth strategy in order to increase our revenue, and must control our costs in order to maintain profitability.\nOver time, our clients tend to resolve recurring transaction processing deficiencies. In addition, many of our clients have an internal staff that audits the transactions before we do. As the skills, experience and resources of our clients' internal recovery audit staffs improve, they will identify many overpayments themselves and reduce some of our audit recovery opportunities. In addition, our revenues are potentially impacted by competitive rate pressures, our dependency on clients to approve our claims on a timely basis, changes in audit scope by our clients and occasional loss of clients or movement from primary to secondary position. We must continually innovate new audit concepts, improve audit execution, develop new clients and successfully execute our own growth strategy in order to increase our revenue and avoid losses in our business.\nWe depend on our largest clients for significant revenue, so losing a major client could adversely affect our revenue and liquidity.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from our largest clients. Our five largest clients collectively accounted for 36.6% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2019, 35.4% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2018 and 36.6% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2017. We have one client, The Kroger Co., that accounted for approximately 10% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2019, and 12% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2018 and 2017. If we lose any of our major clients, our results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we continually seek to diversify our client base, we may be unable to offset the effects of an adverse change in one of our key client relationships. For example, if our existing clients elect not to renew their contracts with us at the expiration of the current terms of those contracts, or reduce the services they purchase thereunder, our recurring revenue base will be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we could lose clients if: (i) they cancel their agreements with us; (ii) we fail to win a competitive bid at the time of contract renewal; (iii) the financial condition of any of our clients deteriorates; or (iv) our clients are acquired by, or acquire, companies with which we do not have contracts. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur strategy may not be successful.\nAs discussed in Item 1 \u201cThe PRGX Strategy,\u201d our objectives are to achieve revenue growth and higher profitability by growing and improving our core recovery audit business, differentiating our service offerings and capabilities, creating adjacent service offerings (including SaaS solutions) and expanding into new high-potential industries and geographies. These efforts are ongoing, and the results of our efforts will not be known until sometime in the future. Successful execution of our strategy requires sustained management focus, innovation, organization and coordination over time, as well as success in building relationships with third parties. If we are unable to execute our strategy successfully, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, execution of our strategy will require material investments and additional costs that may not yield incremental revenue and improved financial performance as planned.\nOur acquisitions, investments, partnerships and strategic alliances may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities.\nAcquisitions have contributed and are expected to continue to contribute to our revenue. Although we cannot predict our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions with complete accuracy, we believe that additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances will be important to our growth strategy.\nWe may finance future acquisitions by issuing additional equity and/or incurring additional debt. Issuing additional equity in connection with any such transaction could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, the announcement or implementation of future transactions by us or others could have a material effect on the price of our common stock. Incurring additional debt in connection with any such transaction could increase our leverage substantially and we could face financial risks associated with incurring significant debt. Additional debt may reduce our liquidity, curtail our access to financing markets, impact our standing with credit agencies and increase the cash flow required for debt service. Any incremental debt incurred to finance an acquisition could also place significant constraints on the operation of our business.\nFurthermore, any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks, including:\n\u2022problems with effective integration of acquired operations;\n\u2022the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;\n\u2022increased operating costs;\n\u2022the diversion of our management team from our other operations;\n\u2022problems with regulatory agencies;\n\u2022exposure to unanticipated liabilities;\n\u2022difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; and\n\u2022changes in our credit rating and financing costs.\nThe terms of our credit facility place restrictions on us, which create risks of default and reduce our flexibility.\nOur current credit facility contains a number of affirmative, negative, and financial covenants that may limit our ability to take certain actions and require us to comply with specified financial ratios and other performance covenants. No assurance can be provided that we will not violate the covenants of our secured credit facility in the future. If we are unable to comply with our covenants in the future, our lenders could pursue their contractual remedies under the credit facility, including requiring the immediate repayment in full of all amounts outstanding, if any. Additionally, we cannot be certain that, if the lenders demanded immediate repayment of any amounts outstanding, we would be able to secure adequate or timely replacement financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur ability to make payments due on debt we may have outstanding will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. If the cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient to make these payments, we may take actions such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures, attempting to restructure or refinance our debt, selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital. Some or all of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations and we could be required to file for bankruptcy. Further, we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our credit agreement may limit our ability to take several of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely affect interest rates which may have an adverse impact on us.\nLIBOR is an interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for a wide range of financial transactions, including our BOA Credit Facility (as discussed in Item 7 \u201cSecured Credit Facility\u201d). In July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time (and if so, what reference rate will replace it) or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in contracts that are currently indexed to United States dollar LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR. The consequences of these developments cannot be predicted, but could adversely affect the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to protect and maintain the competitive advantage of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights.\nOur business is dependent on proprietary software and other technology and intellectual property that we own or license from third parties, including trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents. The steps that we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent misappropriation of and otherwise protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. Our operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, including our software, audit techniques and methodologies, and our intellectual property from potential theft, unauthorized use or compromise.\nWe generally rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. Although we presently hold U.S. registered copyrights on certain of our proprietary technology and certain U.S. and foreign registered trademarks, we may be unable to obtain similar protection on our other intellectual property. In addition, our foreign registered trademarks may not receive the same enforcement protection as our U.S. registered trademarks.\nAdditionally, to protect our confidential information and trade secrets, we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, clients and potential clients. We also limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. Nevertheless, we may be unable to deter or detect the misappropriation, or unauthorized use or dissemination, of our proprietary technology and intellectual property. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. There is no guarantee that our data, proprietary technology and intellectual property will not be improperly accessed, or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology, despite the level of care we take. We may utilize litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could require significant financial and managerial resources, or we may\nelect not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights, depending on our determination of the best use of our resources, the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us.\nWe could be subjected to claims of intellectual property infringement.\nAlthough we are not aware of any infringement of our services and products on the intellectual property rights of others, the potential for intellectual property infringement claims continually increases as the universe of intellectual property continues to rapidly expand, and we are subject to the risk that someone else will assert a claim against us for violating their intellectual property rights. Any claim for intellectual property infringement, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If we were held liable for infringing third-party intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damage awards, and potentially be required to cease using the technology, produce non-infringing technology or obtain a license to use such technology. Such potential liabilities or increased costs could be material to us.\nCyber-security incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, damaging our reputation or exposing us to liability.\nWe receive, process, store and transmit, often electronically, the confidential data of our clients and others. Unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or improper disclosure of confidential information, the deletion or modification of records or could cause interruptions in our operations. These cyber-security risks increase when we transmit information from one location to another, including transmissions over the Internet or other electronic networks. Despite implemented security measures, our facilities, systems and procedures, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, software viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events which may disrupt our delivery of services or expose the confidential information of our clients and others. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information of our clients or others, whether by us or a third-party, could (i) subject us to civil and criminal penalties; (ii) have a negative impact on our reputation; (iii) expose us to litigation and liability to our clients, third parties or governmental authorities; (iv) cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider or otherwise cause us to suffer lost revenue; (v) cause us to incur significant remediation costs; (vi) cause us to incur increased cyber-security protection costs, including those related to organizational changes, addition of personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; and (vii) negatively impact the Company\u2019s competitiveness, stock price and long-term shareholder value. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties.\nThe infrastructure of the Internet consists of multiple fragmented networks. Multiple third-party organizations run this infrastructure together under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority under the stewardship of ICANN. The Internet has experienced outages and other delays resulting from damage to portions of infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and the Internet could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage or result in fragmentation of the Internet, resulting in multiple separate networks lacking interconnection. These scenarios are outside of our control and could adversely affect the delivery of our services by (i) impairing the delivery of SaaS solutions and other hosted software to our clients; (ii) limiting our ability to utilize cloud-based hosting of data and technology; and (iii) impeding the transfer of data from and to our clients. Resulting interruptions in our delivery of services could result in a loss of potential or existing clients and harm our business.\nIn addition, legal or technological restrictions may exist in certain countries that may regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to restrict access to specific websites or content. This could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or Internet Service Providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.\nOur software and SaaS solutions may not be error-free and could result in claims of breach of contract and liabilities.\nOur software and SaaS solutions are very complex and may not be error-free, especially when first released. Although we perform extensive testing, the failure of any solution to operate in accordance with its specifications, documentation or applicable license agreement could require us to correct the deficiency. If such deficiency cannot be corrected in accordance with the relevant contract for services, the deficiency could constitute a material breach of the contract allowing for the contract\u2019s termination and possibly subjecting us to liability. Also, we sometimes indemnify our clients against third-party infringement claims and certain other losses. If such claims for indemnification are made, even if they are without merit, they could be expensive to resolve. A significant judgment against us could have a material adverse impact on us.\nOperational failures in our data processing facilities could harm our business and reputation.\nAn interruption of our hosting facilities or other data processing services, including an interruption caused by damage or destruction of communication lines or physical facilities or a failure of data processing equipment, could result in a loss of clients, difficulties in obtaining new clients and a reduction in revenue. In addition, we also may be liable to third parties or our clients because of such interruption. These risks would increase with longer service interruptions. Despite any disaster recovery and business continuity plans and precautions we have implemented (including insurance) to protect against the effects of service delivery interruptions, such interruptions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur investment of substantial capital in information technology systems, and a failure to successfully implement such systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe have invested and continue to invest substantial amounts in the development and implementation of information technology systems. Although investments are carefully planned, there can be no assurance that such systems will justify the related investments. If we fail to realize the benefits expected from our information technology system investments, or if we fail to do so within the envisioned time frame, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nClient and vendor bankruptcies and financial difficulties could reduce our earnings.\nOur clients generally operate in intensely competitive environments and, accordingly, bankruptcy filings by our clients are not uncommon. Bankruptcy filings by our large clients or the significant vendors who supply them or unexpectedly large vendor claim chargebacks lodged against one or more of our larger clients could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Similarly, our inability to collect our accounts receivable due to other financial difficulties of one or more of our large clients could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions which adversely impact our clients and their vendors in the retail industry in the UK and Europe may continue to have a negative impact on our revenue. Specifically, client liquidity and the liquidity of client vendors can have a significant impact on claim production, the claim approval process, and the ability of clients to offset or otherwise make recoveries from their vendors.\nIf a client files for bankruptcy, we could be subject to an action to recover certain payments received in the 90 days prior to the bankruptcy filing known as \u201cpreference payments.\u201d If we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims, we would be required to make unbudgeted cash payments which could strain our financial liquidity, and our earnings would be reduced.\nOur failure to retain the services of key members of our management team and highly skilled personnel could adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nOur future success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our management team, including our executive officers and other key employees. As such, we have entered into employment agreements with key members of our management team. While these employment agreements include limits on the ability of key employees to directly compete with us in the future, nothing prevents them from leaving our Company. We also do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or other key employees. Thus, we may have to incur costs to replace such employees if we were to lose their services, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such employees in a timely manner.\nIn addition, it is especially challenging to attract and retain highly qualified skilled auditors and other professionals in an industry where competition for skilled personnel is intense. Accordingly, our future performance also depends, in part, on the ability of our management team to work together effectively, manage our workforce, and retain highly qualified personnel.\nWe rely on operations outside the U.S. for a significant portion of our revenue and are increasingly dependent on operations outside the U.S. for supporting our operations globally.\nOperations outside the U.S. generated 40.0% of our annual revenue from continuing operations in 2019, 41.5% in 2018 and 42.2% in 2017. These international operations are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ngreater exposure to the possibility of economic instability, the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances, expropriation or war in the international markets we serve;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly weaknesses in the British pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee and other currencies of countries in which we transact business, which could result in currency translations that materially reduce our revenue and earnings;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with adapting our services to our foreign clients\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\nexpenses and legal restrictions associated with transferring earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, such as those relating to data protection and employment, as well as U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions due to widespread disease, actual or potential terrorist activities, or other catastrophes;\n\u2022\nreduced or limited protection of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable cycles; and\n\u2022\ncompetition with large or state-owned enterprises or regulations that effectively limit our operations and favor local competitors.\nBecause we expect a significant portion of our revenue to continue to come from operations outside the U.S., and expect to continue transitioning certain of our operations to locations outside the U.S., the occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn 2019, our European operations, which include our U.K. operations, accounted for 21.2% of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations. There have been continuing concerns and uncertainties regarding the stability of certain European economies. A continued decline in the economic conditions in Europe may materially and adversely affect our operations both in Europe and on a consolidated basis.\nFurthermore, certain of our core data processing and other functions are located outside the U.S., including India, where approximately 20% of our employees were located on December 31, 2019. While our operations in India have been key to serving clients more efficiently and cost-effectively under our improved service delivery model, India has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries. Geopolitical conflicts, military activity, terrorist attacks, or other political uncertainties in the future could adversely affect the Indian economy by disrupting communications and making business operations and travel more difficult, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver services from India. Disruption of our Indian operations could materially and adversely affect our profitability and our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the U.K. exiting the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), and related negative developments in the EU could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe results of a June 2016 referendum vote in the U.K. were in favor of the U.K. exiting the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). Following the referendum and a lengthy withdrawal process, the U.K. ceased to be a member state of the EU on January 31, 2020. The future relationship between the U.K. and the EU remains uncertain as the U.K. and the EU work through a transition period that provides time for both parties to negotiate the details of their future relationship. The transition period is currently expected to end on December 31, 2020 and, if no agreement is reached, the default scenario would be a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the U.K. would no longer be subject to EU law and would leave the EU\u2019s customs union and single market with no agreements in place governing trade and other aspects of the U.K.-EU relationship, or governing U.K. trade with numerous other countries. In such event, applicable trade rules would default to those promulgated by the World Trade Organization or set forth in individual agreements put in place between the U.K. and individual EU member states and other countries outside the EU.\nBrexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets (including currency and credit markets), particularly in the U.K. and the EU. Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the euro and the British pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency).\nIn addition, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the terms of Brexit has in the past led to, and the outcome of Brexit may lead to, certain macroeconomic conditions that could adversely affect our business. These macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in economic climate, legal uncertainty, and the implementation of potentially divergent or prohibitive laws and regulations as the U.K. shifts to a U.K.-specific regulatory framework, may negatively impact demand for our services and our ability to deliver our services into the EU, the U.K. and elsewhere. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the EU and elsewhere. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on any agreements the U.K. makes or does not make to retain access to EU and other markets following the transition period.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications a no-deal Brexit would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. A significant portion of our operations are conducted in the U.K. As a result, a no-deal Brexit could restrict access to our services by persons located in the EU or make access more expensive, which could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In early 2020, this coronavirus spread to other countries, including the U.S., and efforts to contain the spread of this coronavirus intensified. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that we, our clients, our respective suppliers, or governments may take in respect of this coronavirus may disrupt our business and the business of our clients. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations despite the fact that such impacts may not be felt for a significant period of time. Although we are diligently working to ensure that we can operate with minimal disruption, and to mitigate the impact of the outbreak on our employees\u2019 health and safety, the full extent to which the coronavirus could affect the global economy and our results will depend on future developments and factors that cannot be predicted.\nOur business operates in highly competitive environments and is subject to pricing pressure.\nThe environments in which our business operates are highly competitive, with numerous other recovery audit firms and other service providers. In addition, many of our recovery audit clients have developed their own internal recovery audit capabilities. As a result of competition among the providers of these services and the availability of certain recovery audit services from clients\u2019 internal audit departments, our business is subject to intense rate pressure. Our Adjacent Services business also has numerous competitors varying in size, market strength and specialization, many of whom have established and well-known franchises and brands. Intense price competition faced by all of our service lines could negatively impact our profit margins and have a potential adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur client contracts generally contain provisions under which the client may terminate our services prior to the completion of the agreement.\nMany of our client contracts provide that the client may terminate the contract without cause prior to the end of the term of the agreement by providing us with relatively short prior written notice of the termination. As a result, the existence of contractual relationships with our clients is not an assurance that we will continue to provide services for our clients through the entire term of their respective agreements. If clients representing a significant portion of our revenue terminated their agreements unexpectedly, we may not, in the short-term, be able to replace the revenue and income from such contracts and this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, client contract terminations also could harm our reputation within the industry which could negatively impact our ability to obtain new clients.\nOur charges to earnings resulting from acquisition, restructuring and integration costs may materially adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nWe account for the completion of our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the total estimated purchase prices to net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisitions, record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Our financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected by a number of financial adjustments required in purchase accounting including the following:\n\u2022\nwe will incur additional amortization expense over the estimated useful lives of certain of the intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions during such estimated useful lives;\n\u2022\nwe will incur additional depreciation expense as a result of recording purchased tangible assets; and\n\u2022\nto the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\nOur failure to comply with applicable governmental privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally could substantially impact our business, operations, financial position, and cash flows. Additionally, compliance with the laws and regulations relating to the handing of personal data may impede our ability to provide services in certain jurisdictions and may result in increased costs.\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and foreign privacy laws and regulations. Changes in privacy laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could have a substantial effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in the termination or loss of contracts, the imposition of contractual damages, civil sanctions, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, or in certain circumstances, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, business and prospects. Determining compliance with such regulations is complicated by the fact that the interpretations of these laws and regulations by governing regulatory authorities and the courts evolve over time, and many of the provisions of such laws and regulations are open to a wide range of interpretations. There can be no assurance that we are or have been in compliance with all applicable existing laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with new laws or regulations.\nWith respect to trans-border personal data flows from the EU and the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), PRGX USA, Inc. is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission, as a valid mechanism to legally transfer EU and EEA personal data from the EU and EEA to the U.S.; however, it is possible that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework may be challenged in EU/EEA courts, and there is some uncertainty\nregarding its future validity and our ability to rely on it for EU/EEA to U.S. data transfers. In addition, despite our Privacy Shield certification and extensive efforts to maintain the privacy, integrity and controlled use of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, through a combination of hardware, software, and physical security, coupled with strong internal data security processes, procedures and controls that we believe meet or exceed relevant laws, regulations and industry best practices, we may experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients to use our services due to the potential risk exposure they may face as a result of their data being transferred outside of the EU/EEA.\nFurther, in 2016, the EU adopted a new law governing data protection practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018. GDPR is a redesign of the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and is intended to boost the online and offline privacy rights of individuals. GDPR places more stringent operational requirements on processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements to correct or erase an individual\u2019s information upon request, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR also significantly increases penalties for non-compliance.\nBrexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the U.K. In the immediate term, the U.K. will remain directly bound by GDPR. The U.K. government implemented the Data Protection Act of 2018 and issued a statutory instrument, The Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which substantially implements GDPR in U.K. domestic legislation. While the U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has announced that there are no plans to dilute U.K. data protection laws, it is less certain how data protection laws or regulations will develop in the future, and how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated. The EU Commission has announced that the U.K. will become a \u201cthird country\u201d once it has exited the EU, notwithstanding the U.K.\u2019s stated intention to transpose all existing EU law into its domestic law.\nLaws are also increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the EU\u2019s e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are also subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions.\nIn the United States, there are numerous federal and state laws governing the privacy and security of personal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has been dubbed the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d law in the United States since it creates new individual privacy rights for California \u201cconsumers\u201d (as that term is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of California consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to such California consumers, provides such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. It remains unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber-threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to data protection. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws.\nThe EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the GDPR, the EU\u2019s e-Privacy Directive, the CCPA and other applicable laws and regulations could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to provide our services in certain locations or our clients\u2019 ability to deploy our solutions globally. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with these data privacy laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our data privacy compliance efforts. These compliance efforts may be time-intensive and costly. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or to comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, GDPR, the EU\u2019s e-Privacy Directive, the CCPA or other applicable regimes.\nWe are subject to legislative, regulatory, and legal developments involving taxes.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other types of taxes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly changed the U.S. corporate income tax system. Given our U.S. valuation allowance, the Tax Act does not materially impact our income tax provision or balance sheet, however further changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the Tax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, higher tax rates, claims, audits, investigations or legal proceedings involving taxing authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nCertain ownership changes may limit our ability to use our net operating losses.\nWe have substantial tax loss and credit carry-forwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On December 30, 2016, the Company experienced an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d). This ownership change resulted in an annual IRC Section 382 limitation that limits the use of certain tax attribute carry-forwards and also resulted in the write-off of certain deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowances that the Company recorded in 2017. If a future ownership change occurs and limits our ability to use our historical net operating loss carryforwards, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations by increasing our future tax obligations.\nCertain of our tax positions may be subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and if successful, these challenges could increase our future tax liabilities and expense.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as local country tax purposes in the jurisdictions where we operate, from time to time we take positions under provisions of applicable tax law that are subject to varying interpretations. Certain of our tax positions may be subject to challenge by the applicable taxing authorities, including, in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service. If our tax positions are successfully challenged, our future tax liabilities and expense could significantly increase.\nWhile we believe that our tax positions are proper based on applicable law and we believe that it is more likely than not that we would prevail with respect to challenges to these positions, we can make no assurances that we would prevail if our positions are challenged or that business economics would justify the mounting of a legal defense against such challenges. If our tax positions are successfully challenged by the U.S. or non-U.S. taxing authorities, it could increase our future tax liabilities and expense and have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities or additional costs if the U.S. government changes certain U.S. tax rules or other tax laws applicable to U.S. corporations doing business in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S. corporation that conducts business both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, proposals for changes to tax and other laws are made that may negatively impact U.S. corporations doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including proposals for tax reform. While the scope of future changes remains unclear, proposed changes might include limiting the ability of U.S. corporations to deduct certain expenses attributable to offshore earnings, modifying the foreign tax credit rules and taxing currently certain transfers of intangible assets offshore or imposing other economic disincentives to doing business outside of the U.S. The enactment of some or all of these proposals could increase the Company\u2019s effective tax rate or otherwise adversely affect our profitability.\nFuture impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets would reduce our future earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $26.6 million. We must perform a periodic assessment to determine whether some portion, or all, of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets are impaired. Our most recent assessment resulted in an impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Our intangible assets showed no impairment. Future impairment testing could result in an additional determination that our goodwill, other intangible assets or our other long-lived assets have been impaired. Future adverse changes in the business environment or in our ability to perform audits successfully and compete effectively in our markets or the discontinuation of our use of certain of our intangible or other long-lived assets could result in impairment which could materially adversely impact future earnings.\nOur articles of incorporation, bylaws and Georgia law may inhibit a change of control that shareholders may favor.\nOur articles of incorporation, bylaws and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition of PRGX that is not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders receive attractive offers for their shares or if a substantial number, or even a majority, of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022\nspecified requirements for calling special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees, clients and creditors and the local community, in making decisions; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations, powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any further vote or action by our shareholders.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2019, our stock traded as high as $9.68 per share and as low as $3.95 per share. Our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including:\n\u2022future announcements concerning us, key clients or competitors;\n\u2022variations in operating results and liquidity;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022developments with respect to technology or litigation;\n\u2022changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to our\nCompany;\n\u2022acquisitions and financings; and\n\u2022sales and purchases of our stock by insiders.\nFluctuations in the stock market, generally, also impact the volatility of our stock price. Finally, general economic conditions and stock market movements may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.", "PERMNO": 83304, "SIC": 8721, "TIC": "PRGX"}
