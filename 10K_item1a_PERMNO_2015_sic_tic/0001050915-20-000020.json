{"cik": "1050915", "company": "QUANTA SERVICES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. The matters described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing our company, and risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be negatively affected, the value of securities we have issued could be adversely affected, resulting in stockholders and purchasers losing part or all of their investment, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic initiatives or expectations. This Annual Report also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and Information included in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industries and Operating Our Business\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur business can be highly cyclical and is subject to seasonality and other factors that can result in significantly different operating results from quarter to quarter, and therefore our results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of future results. Our quarterly results have been and may in the future be materially and/or adversely affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe timing and volume of work we perform and our performance with respect to ongoing projects;\n\u2022\nproject delays, reductions in project scope, project terminations or cancellations and increases in project costs, including as a result of, among other things, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions or events, legal challenges or permitting, regulatory or environmental processes;\n\u2022\nvariations in the size, scope, costs and margins of ongoing projects and the mix of our customers, contracts and business;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in economic, political and market conditions on a regional, national or global basis;\n\u2022\npricing pressures as a result of competition;\n\u2022\nchanges in the budgetary spending patterns or strategic plans of customers or federal, state, provincial and local governments;\n\u2022\nliabilities and costs incurred in our operations that are not covered by, or that are in excess of, our third-party insurance, including significant liabilities that arise from the inherently hazardous conditions of our operations (e.g., explosions, fires) and which could be exacerbated by the geographies in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndisputes with customers or delays relating to billing and payment under our contracts and change orders;\n\u2022\npayment risk associated with the financial condition of customers, including customers affected by the volatility of natural gas and oil prices or that have filed for bankruptcy protection;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of, or unexpected or increased costs associated with, pending or threatened legal proceedings, indemnity obligations, multiemployer pension plan obligations (e.g., withdrawal liability) or other claims asserted against us;\n\u2022\nthe termination or expiration of existing customer agreements;\n\u2022\nrestructuring, severance and other costs associated with winding down certain operations and exiting markets, including our Latin American operations;\n\u2022\nestimates and assumptions in determining our financial results, remaining performance obligations and backlog, including the timing and significance of impairments of long-lived assets, equity or other investments, receivables, goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nsignificant fluctuations in foreign currency rates;\n\u2022\nthe recognition of tax impacts related to changes in tax laws or uncertain tax positions; and\n\u2022\nthe timing and magnitude of costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise.\nNegative economic and market conditions, including low oil and natural gas production volumes and prices, can adversely impact our customers\u2019 future spending as well as payment for our services.\nStagnant or declining economic conditions, including a prolonged economic downturn or recession, as well as significant events that have an impact on financial or capital markets, can adversely impact the demand for our services and result in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects. A number of factors can adversely affect the industries we serve, including, among other things, financing conditions, potential bankruptcies and global and U.S. trade relationships and other geopolitical events. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our services and also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric power, energy or communications industries can also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers.\nOur Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment is exposed to risks associated with the oil and gas industry. These risks, which are not subject to our control, include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and production, the development of and consumer demand for alternative energy sources, and legislative and regulatory actions, as well as public opinion, regarding the impact of fossil fuels on the climate and environment. Specifically, lower prices and production volumes, or perceived risk thereof, can result in decreased or delayed spending by our customers, including with respect to larger pipeline and industrial projects. In addition, the 2020 U.S. presidential and congressional elections may result in a change in administration and control of Congress with the potential consequence of increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry. If the profitability of our Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment were to decline, our overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected. Additionally, a decline in prices, production or the development of resource plays can negatively impact certain portions of our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. For example, the low price of oil has had an adverse impact on the Canadian economy, which has impacted demand for some of our electric power services in Canada.\nA variety of issues outside of our control could affect the timing of and our performance on projects, which may result in additional costs to us, reductions or delays in revenues, the payment of liquidated damages or project termination.\nOur business is dependent in part upon projects that can be cyclical in nature and are subject to risks of delay or cancellation. The timing of or failure to obtain contracts, delays in awards of, start dates for or completion of projects and the cancellations of projects can result in significant periodic fluctuations in our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of our projects involve challenging engineering, permitting, procurement and construction phases that occur over extended time periods, sometimes several years, and we have encountered and may in the future encounter project delays or project performance issues as a result of, among other things:\n\u2022\ndelays in the delivery or management of design or engineering information, equipment or materials;\n\u2022\nschedule changes;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, including wildfires, earthquakes and significant weather events (e.g., hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, droughts, blizzards and extreme temperatures);\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions (e.g., prolonged rainfall or snowfall, early thaw in Canada and the northern United States, other unseasonable weather patterns);\n\u2022\nour or a customer\u2019s failure to timely obtain permits or rights of way or meet other permitting, regulatory or environmental requirements or conditions;\n\u2022\ndifficult terrain and site conditions where delivery of materials and availability of labor are impacted or where there is exposure to harsh and hazardous conditions;\n\u2022\nprotests, legal challenges or other political activity or opposition to a project;\n\u2022\nchanges in permitting and regulatory requirements during the course of our work; and\n\u2022\nother factors such as terrorism, military action and public health crises (including the outbreak of the recent coronavirus);\n\u2022\nadditional complexity, timing uncertainty or extended bidding, regulatory and permitting processes associated with the projects where we provide engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services.\nIn addition, we contract with third-party suppliers and subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts, and approximately 15% to 20% of our work is subcontracted to other service providers. A delay or failure to perform by suppliers or by subcontractors can result in delays in the overall progress of the project or cause us to incur additional costs.\nMany of these difficulties and delays are beyond our control and can negatively impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the required delivery schedule or achieve our anticipated margin on the project. Delays and additional costs may be substantial and not recoverable from third parties, and in some cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays. Furthermore, in certain circumstances we guarantee project completion or performance by a scheduled date, and failure to meet the schedule or performance requirements can result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages. Such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, project delay or performance difficulties can result in project cancellation by a customer or damage to our reputation or relationship with a customer, which can adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts. Additional costs or penalties, a reduction in our productivity or efficiency or a project termination in any given period can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, as discussed in further detail in Legal Proceedings within Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the termination of a telecommunications project in Peru resulted in a $79.2 million charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur revenues and profitability can be exposed to potential risk if our customers encounter financial difficulties or file bankruptcy or disputes arise with our customers.\nOur contracts often require us to satisfy or achieve certain milestones in order to receive payment, or in the case of cost-reimbursable contracts, provide support for billings in advance of payment. As a result, we can incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of work prior to receipt of payment. We face difficulties collecting payment and sometimes failed to receive payment for such costs in circumstances where our customers do not proceed to project completion, terminate or cancel a contract, default on their payment obligations, or dispute the adequacy of our billing support. We have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to the payment terms of our contracts. For example, we have filed an international arbitration proceeding against the customer in connection with the terminated telecommunications project in Peru, which seeks to recover, among other things, amounts related to a net receivable position of approximately $120 million as of December 31, 2019. For additional information on this matter, see Legal Proceedings within Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims can have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and any such claims may harm our relationships with our customers.\nSlowing economic conditions in the industries we serve can also impair the financial condition of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Further, to the extent a customer files bankruptcy, payment of amounts owed can be delayed and certain payments we receive prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition may be avoided and returned to the customer\u2019s bankruptcy estate. For example, in January 2019, PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (collectively, PG&E), one of our largest customers, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended, which impacted the collection of approximately $165 million of pre-petition receivables. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Concentrations of Credit Risk for additional information on this matter. Additionally, many of our customers for larger projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and could be more likely to encounter financial difficulties relating to their businesses. We ultimately may be unable to collect amounts owed to us by customers experiencing financial difficulties or\nin bankruptcy, and accounts receivable from such customers may become uncollectible and ultimately have to be written off, which could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to operational hazards, including, among others, wildfires and explosions, that can result in significant liabilities and that may be exacerbated by certain geographies and locations where we perform services, and we may not be insured against all potential liabilities.\nDue to the nature of services we provide and the conditions in which we and our customers operate, our business is subject to operational hazards and accidents that can result in significant liabilities. These operational hazards include, among other things, electricity, fires, explosions, leaks, collisions, mechanical failures, and damage from severe weather conditions and natural disasters. Furthermore, certain of our customers operate energy- and communications-related infrastructure assets in locations and environments that increase the likelihood and/or severity of these operational hazards, including as a result of changes in climate and other factors in recent years. In particular, we perform a significant amount of services, including operational, consulting and other services, for customers that operate electrical power, natural gas and communications infrastructure assets in the western United States, Australia and other locations that have recently experienced, and have a higher risk of, wildfires. For example, certain of Quanta\u2019s operating units perform inspection, consulting, repair, maintenance and other services for utilities and other customers that operate electric power and other infrastructure in California and other areas in the western United States, including recent inspection of, and other services relating to, the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure operated by PG&E in California. PG&E and certain other utility customers have been determined to be or are potentially responsible for catastrophic wildfires that have occurred in recent years. Quanta\u2019s operating units have received document hold requests and subpoenas in connection with these events. We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding relating to such wildfires at this time, and no related claims asserting liabilities against Quanta or its operating units have been filed. However, there is no assurance that claims will not be filed in the future.\nWe also often perform services in locations that are densely populated and that have higher value property and assets, such as California and metropolitan areas, which can increase the impact of any of these hazards or other accidents we experience. We recently acquired The Hallen Construction Co., Inc. (Hallen), a company that specializes in underground gas and electric distribution and transmission services and operates in metropolitan areas throughout the northeastern United States, including New York City, New York. This acquisition, including certain assumed liabilities associated with its pre-acquisition operations, which are described further in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, increases our potential exposure to certain of these hazards and accidents.\nEvents arising from operational hazards and accidents have resulted in significant liabilities to us in the past and may expose us to significant claims and liabilities in the future. These claims and liabilities can arise through indemnification obligations to customers, our negligence or otherwise, and because our services in certain instances are integral to the operation and performance of our customers\u2019 infrastructure, such claims and liabilities can arise even if our operations are not the cause of the harm. Our exposure to liability can also extend for a number of years after we complete our services, and potential claims and liabilities arising from significant accidents and events can take a number of years and significant legal costs to ultimately resolve.\nPotential liabilities include, among other things, claims associated with personal injury, including severe injury or loss of life, and significant damage to property, equipment and the environment, and other claims discussed above and can lead to suspension of operations, adverse effects to our safety record and reputation and/or material legal costs and liabilities. In addition, if any of these events or losses related thereto are found to be the result of our or our customer\u2019s activities or services, we could be subject to government enforcement actions or regulatory penalties, litigation and/or civil or governmental actions, including investigations, citations and fines. Insurance coverage may not be available to us or may be insufficient to cover the cost of any of these liabilities and legal costs. If we are not fully insured or indemnified against such liabilities and legal costs or a counterparty fails to meet its indemnification obligations to us, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, to the extent our reputation or safety record is adversely affected, demand for our services could decline or we may not be able to bid for certain work.\nUnavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance coverage would increase our overall risk exposure, as well as disrupt our operations, and estimates of losses covered by our insurance policies could prove incorrect.\nWe maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. We are insured for, among other things, employer\u2019s liability, workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability and general liability claims, but such insurance is subject to deductibles and limits and may be canceled or may not cover all of our losses. We manage and maintain a portion of our casualty risk through our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which insures all claims up to the amount of the applicable deductible of our third-party insurance programs. In connection with our casualty insurance programs, we are required to issue letters of credit to secure our obligations. Our insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice, and coverage could be denied if we fail to comply with those requirements.\nAdditionally, our insurance coverages may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all claims and liabilities asserted against us, and if we are not fully insured against such claims and liabilities, it could expose us to significant liabilities and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of coverage offered by third parties may change in future periods. For example, due to the increased occurrence in recent years and future risk of wildfires in California and other areas in the western United States, Australia and other locations, insurers have reduced coverage limits and increased the cost of insurance coverage for those events. As a result, we expect our level of insurance coverage for wildfire events will decrease at the time of our annual insurance renewal in the spring of 2020, and such level may not be sufficient to cover potential losses. In addition, our third party insurers could decide to further reduce or exclude coverage for wildfires in the future. There can also be no assurance that any of our other existing third-party insurance coverages will be renewed at their current levels or at all or that any future coverage will be available at reasonable and competitive rates. Our third-party insurers could also fail, cancel our coverage or otherwise be unable or unwilling to provide us with adequate insurance coverage. Adverse changes in our insurance coverage could increase our exposure to uninsured losses, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or result in a disruption of our operations.\nLosses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. If we experience claims or costs above our estimates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees or we may incur significant costs in the event we are unable to efficiently manage our workforce.\nOur ability to efficiently manage our business and achieve our strategic initiatives is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled personnel, which is subject to a number of risks. The commencement of new, large-scale infrastructure projects or increased demand for infrastructure improvements, as well as the aging electric utility workforce, has reduced and may further reduce the pool of skilled workers, including qualified journeyman lineman, available for our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. With respect to our Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment, there is limited availability of experienced supervisors and foremen that can oversee larger diameter pipeline projects. The cyclical nature of the natural gas and oil industry can also create shortages of qualified labor during periods of high demand and production. A shortage in the supply of these personnel creates competitive hiring markets that may result in increased labor expenses. Additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant education and training expenses in order to recruit and train employees.\nThe uncertainty of contract award timing and project delays can also present difficulties in managing our workforce size. Our inability to efficiently manage our workforce may require us to incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancies that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of, or reduction in business from, one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA few customers have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenues. For example, our ten largest customers accounted for 34% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant customers, a significant customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue business with us at any time or merge or be acquired by a company that decides to reduce or discontinue business with us. PG&E, one of our largest customers, has filed for bankruptcy, and other significant customers may file for bankruptcy protection or cease operations, which could also result in reduced or discontinued business with us. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may fail to adequately recover on contract change orders or claims brought by us against customers.\nWe have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers. These types of claims occur due to, among other things, delays caused by customers and third parties and changes in project scope, which can result in additional costs that may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. While we generally negotiate with the customer for additional compensation, we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred. Litigation or arbitration with respect to these matters is generally lengthy and costly, involves significant uncertainty as to timing and amount of any resolution, and can adversely affect our relationship with existing or potential customers. Furthermore, we can be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of a claim is pending. Failure to obtain adequate and prompt compensation for these matters can result in a reduction of revenues and gross profit recognized in prior periods or the recognition of a loss. Any such reduction or loss can be substantial and can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to accurately estimate project costs or successfully execute a project could result in reduced profits or losses.\nWe currently generate, and expect to continue generating, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts, including contracts for projects where we provide EPC services (e.g., large electric transmission and pipeline projects, facility and terminal projects). Under these contracts, we assume risks related to project estimates and execution, and project revenues, profitability and costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nunforeseen circumstances or project modifications not included in our cost estimates or covered by our contract for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation, including concealed or unknown environmental, geological or geographical site conditions and technical problems such as design or engineering issues;\n\u2022\nfailure to accurately estimate project costs or accurately establish the scope of our services;\n\u2022\nfailure to coordinate performance of subcontractors, suppliers and other third parties or delays and failure to perform by such parties;\n\u2022\ninability to meet project schedule requirements or achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards for a project, which can result in increased costs or the payment of liquidated damages to the customer;\n\u2022\nfailure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards (e.g., engineering standards);\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost of equipment, commodities, materials or labor;\n\u2022\ncontract termination or suspension and our inability to obtain reimbursement for services performed, costs incurred or expected profit;\n\u2022\ndelays or productivity issues caused by adverse weather conditions, significant weather events or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndelays and additional costs associated with obtaining required permits or approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations;\n\u2022\ndelays and additional costs attributable to legal challenges and protests and other political activity; and\n\u2022\nquality issues, including those requiring rework or replacement.\nThese factors and events can result in reputational harm or cause actual revenues and gross profits for a project to differ from what we originally estimated, resulting in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Such differences can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in estimates related to revenues and costs associated with our contracts with customers could result in a reduction or elimination of revenues, a reduction of profits or the recognition of losses.\nFor fixed price contracts and certain unit-price contracts, we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied over time and earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability, as discussed in further detail in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Changes in contract estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made, and contract losses are recognized in full when losses are determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Variable consideration amounts, including performance incentives, early pay discounts and penalties, may also cause changes in contract estimates. In addition, we recognize amounts associated with change orders and/or claims as revenue when it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and the amount of any such adjustment can be reasonably estimated, which can result in the recognition of costs prior to the recognition of the related revenue. Furthermore, actual amounts collected in connection with change orders can differ from estimated amounts.\nConsequently, the timing for recognition of revenues and profit or loss and any subsequent changes in estimates is uncertain and could result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported revenues or profits or the recognition of losses on the associated contract. Any such adjustments could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, compensation for breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence or property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we are allocated risk\nthrough our contract terms for actions by our customers, subcontractors or other third parties. Because our services in certain instances can be integral to the operation and performance of our customers\u2019 infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services are not the cause of such failures. We could also be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, which could be material. Insurance coverage may not be available or may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings. The outcome of any allegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings, as well as any public reaction thereto, is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs, damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For details on our existing litigation, claims and other legal proceedings, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth, which could adversely affect our business.\nMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth are beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will be successful. Inability to successfully generate internal growth may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022\nexpand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving infrastructure needs;\n\u2022\nattract new customers;\n\u2022\nincrease the number of projects performed for existing customers;\n\u2022\nhire and retain qualified employees;\n\u2022\nexpand geographically; and\n\u2022\naddress regulatory, environmental and permitting requirements and economic or market conditions that affect us or our customers.\nMany of our contracts may be canceled or suspended on short notice or may not be renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur customers have in the past and may in the future cancel, delay or reduce the number or size of projects available to us for a variety of reasons, including capital constraints or inability to meet regulatory requirements. Furthermore, many of our customers may cancel or suspend our contracts on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract. Certain of our customers assign work to us on a project-by-project basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be negatively impacted if any of the following occur:\n\u2022\nour customers cancel or suspend contracts having significant value;\n\u2022\nwe fail to renew a significant number of our existing contracts;\n\u2022\nwe complete a significant number of non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects;\n\u2022\nthe anticipated volume of work under an existing master service agreement is not assigned to us;\n\u2022\nwe are not the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are subject to re-bid in the future; or\n\u2022\nwe fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenues.\nOur business is highly competitive, and competitive pressures, technological advancements and other market conditions could negatively affect our business.\nThe specialty contracting business is served by numerous companies, from small, owner-operated private companies to large multi-national, public companies. Relatively few barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. Our competitors may have or may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or enhance our competitive position within the specialty contracting business or maintain our current customer base. Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures, and therefore may be able to provide services at lower rates than us. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers, which are capable of performing, or acquiring businesses that perform, some of the same types of services we provide. These customers may also face pressure or be compelled by regulatory or other requirements to self-perform an\nincreasing amount of the services we currently perform for them. Therefore, we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource these services in the future.\nFurthermore, a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly dependent upon obtaining new contracts. The timing of project awards is unpredictable and often involves complex and lengthy negotiations and bidding processes. These processes are impacted by a wide variety of factors, including price, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. The competitive environment we operate in can also affect the timing of contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. For example, based on rapidly changing competition dynamics, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, more competitive pricing in certain markets, such as the smaller scale transmission and distribution electric power market. Our bids also may not be successful due to, among other things, a potential customer\u2019s perception of our ability to perform the work or the technological advantages held by our competitors. Additionally, changing competitive pressures present difficulties in matching workforce size with available contract awards. As a result, the competitive environment we operate in can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and cause our results of operations and cash flows to fluctuate significantly.\nTechnological advancements and other factors may alter our customers\u2019 existing operating model or the services they require, which may also result in reduced demand for our services. In addition, market changes within our customers\u2019 industries could impact their future demand for our services, such as a reduction in demand for hydrocarbons or plastics that negatively impacts certain of our customers. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these changes to our customers\u2019 existing operating model in a cost-effective manner and to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any change or obsolescence or incur significant expenditures in adapting to such change, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential liability for warranty, engineering and other related claims.\nUnder our contracts with customers, we typically provide warranties for our services and materials we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against, among other things, defects in workmanship, and may agree to indemnify our customers for losses related to our services. The length of the warranty periods we agree to vary and can extend for several years, and certain projects can have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that are broader than the warranties we generally provide. Warranties generally require us to re-perform the services and/or repair or replace the warranted item and any other facilities impacted thereby, at our sole expense, and we could also be responsible for other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. In addition, we can be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we provide. While we generally require the materials suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we provide to our customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, our business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of electric power transmission, communications and pipeline infrastructure. Because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. A significantly adverse or catastrophic event at a project site or completed project resulting from the services we performed could result in significant professional or product liability, personal injury (including claims for loss of life) or property damage claims or other claims against us, as well as reputational harm. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or impact our ability to obtain third-party insurance in the future, and customers, subcontractors or suppliers who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. As a result, these claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe can incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters.\nOur operations are inherently hazardous and subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered serious accidents, including fatalities, and we anticipate that our operations may result in additional serious accidents in the future. As a result of these events, we could be subject to substantial penalties, criminal prosecution or civil litigation, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, that could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts and elect to procure future services from other providers. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the costs of projects for our clients, and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruptions to our information technology systems or our failure to adequately protect critical data, sensitive information and technology systems could materially affect our business or result in harm to our reputation.\nWe rely on information technology systems to manage our operations and other business processes and to protect sensitive company information. We also collect and retain information about our customers, stockholders, vendors and employees, all of which expect that we will adequately protect such information. Breaches or disruptions of our information systems can result from, among other things, cyber-attacks, theft, inadvertent exposure of sensitive information, acts of terrorism, storms or other natural phenomena, information technology solution failures or network disruptions, and any such cyber-attacks or breaches can go unnoticed for some period of time. An intrusion into the information systems of a business we acquire may also ultimately compromise our systems. Furthermore, some of the energy infrastructure systems on which we work may be considered to be strategic targets, and therefore at greater risk of cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism than other targets. Cyber-attacks can result in compromises of our payment systems, monetary losses, inability to access our systems, delays in processing transactions or reporting financial results, the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary company information (including for the purpose of transacting in our stock), or the release of customer, stockholder, vendor or employee data. An attack could also cause service disruptions to our internal systems or, in extreme circumstances, infiltration into, damage to or loss of control of our customers\u2019 energy infrastructure systems. Any such breach or disruption could subject us to significant liabilities, cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships, or result in regulatory investigations or other actions by governmental authorities.\nWe also continue to implement information technology solutions that require substantial financial and personnel resources. There is no guarantee that we will realize economic or other intended benefits from these systems. Furthermore, failure to properly implement these systems could result in substantial disruptions to our business, including with respect to coordinating and processing our normal business activities and financial reporting and testing and recording certain data necessary to provide oversight of our disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal controls over our financial reporting, as well as other unforeseen problems.\nAny deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands, which can be exacerbated by the effect of social media or significant media coverage, could have an adverse impact on our business or reputation.\nOur brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. The success of our business and our ability to attract and retain customers depends on brand recognition and reputation. Such dependence makes our business susceptible to reputational damage and to competition from other companies. A variety of events could result in damage to our reputation or brands, some of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nacts or omissions that adversely affect our business such as a crime, scandal, cyber-related incident, litigation or other negative publicity;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully perform a high-profile project;\n\u2022\nactual or potential involvement in a catastrophic fire, explosion or similar event; or\n\u2022\nactual or perceived responsibility for a serious accident or injury.\nIntensifying media coverage, including the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years, has increased the volume and speed at which negative publicity arising from these events can be generated and spread, and we may be unable to timely respond to, correct any inaccuracies in, or adequately address negative perceptions arising from such media coverage. If the reputation or perceived quality of our brands decline, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected and we could lose the confidence of our customers, which could adversely affect demand for our services.\nOur financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, several estimates and assumptions are used by management to report the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are necessary because certain information used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. For example, we utilize estimates in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, equity and other investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, liabilities for insurance and other claims and guarantees, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts inclusive of contractual change orders and claims, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, provision (benefit) for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax positions. Actual results for all estimates can differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, our remaining performance obligations and backlog are difficult to determine with certainty. Customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on short notice. Cancellation or reduction in scope of a contract can significantly reduce the revenues and profit we receive. Consequently, our estimates of remaining performance obligations and backlog may not be accurate, and we may not be able to realize our estimated remaining performance obligations and backlog.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by impairments to goodwill, other intangible assets, receivables, long-lived assets or investments. For example, when we acquire a business, we record goodwill in an amount equal to the amount we paid for the business minus the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets of the acquired business. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, as described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We have recorded impairments in the past, and any future impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized. For example, during the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, we recorded $13.9 million and $49.4 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to the winding down and exit of certain oil-influenced operations and assets. Additionally, we have concluded to pursue an orderly exit of our Latin American operations, which could result in asset impairments related to those operations during 2020 or in subsequent years.\nIn addition, we enter into various types of investment arrangements in the normal course of business, each having unique terms and conditions. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether there has been a decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying amount and whether that decline is considered to be other than temporary as described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur inability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy.\nOur business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business. The number of acquisition targets that meet our criteria may be limited. We may also face competition for acquisition opportunities, and other potential acquirers may offer more favorable terms or have greater financial resources available for potential acquisitions. This competition may further limit our acquisition opportunities or raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive, or possibly not accretive, to us. Failure to consummate future acquisitions could negatively affect our growth strategies. Additionally, our past acquisitions have involved, and our future acquisitions may involve, significant cash expenditures, the incurrence or assumption of debt and the assumption of burdensome regulatory requirements and liabilities. For example, in the Hallen acquisition, we assumed certain contingent liabilities associated with Hallen\u2019s pre-acquisition operations, which are described further in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. As a result, past or future acquisitions may ultimately have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe success of our acquisition strategy also depends on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations and realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations, elimination of redundant costs and capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities. Our ability to integrate and realize benefits can be negatively impacted by, among other things:\n\u2022\nfailure of an acquired business to achieve the results we expect;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from operational and other matters or other potential disruptions to our existing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties incorporating the operations and personnel, or inability to retain key personnel, of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nadditional financial reporting and accounting challenges associated with an acquired business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated events or liabilities associated with the operations of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nloss of business due to customer overlap or other factors; and\n\u2022\nrisks and liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, such as performance, operational, safety, workforce or other compliance or tax issues, some of which we may not have discovered or accurately estimated during our due diligence and may not be covered by indemnification obligations or available insurance.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully complete the integration process without substantial costs, delays, disruptions or other operational or financial problems. Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business growth could outpace the capability of our decentralized management structure.\nWe cannot be certain that our management structure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand. For example, the ability to internally communicate, coordinate and execute business strategies, plans and tactics may be negatively impacted by our increasing size and complexity. A decentralized structure places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of our operating unit management. This contributes to the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting key business matters than we would in a more centralized environment. The lack of timely access to information may also impact the quality of decision making by management. Our decentralized organization can also result in our operating subsidiaries assuming excessive risk without appropriate guidance from our centralized legal, accounting, safety, tax, treasury and insurance functions. Future growth could also impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit, integrate and retain new senior level managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan.\nThe loss of key personnel could disrupt our business.\nWe depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management, including the management at each of our operating units. Although we typically enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key employees for initial terms of one to three years and subsequent renewal options, we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key management personnel, as well as our inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees that can succeed key personnel, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.\nOur investments expose us to risks and may result in conflicts of interest that could adversely impact our business or result in reputational harm.\nWe have entered into strategic relationships and investment arrangements with various partners, including customers and infrastructure investors, through which we have invested and intend to invest in infrastructure assets. We expect this activity to continue in the future and for additional information on our recent investment activity, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures.\nThese types of investments expose us to increased risks, including poor performance by the infrastructure projects in which we have invested due to, among other things, difficult market or economic conditions or slowdowns (which may occur across one or more industries, sectors or geographies) or changes to the supply or demand and fluctuations in the price of commodities. That negative performance could result in lower investment returns, a decline in value or total loss of our investments or the possible sale of our investments at values below our initial projections, including at a loss, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, poor performance of our investments or poor or incomplete performance by our capital partnership structure formed with select infrastructure investors could result in reputational harm to Quanta that impairs our ability to participate in future investment opportunities, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to secure certain future projects. For example, in October 2019, due to certain management changes, our capital partnership investment structure with select investors entered into a 180-day period during which the investors and Quanta will evaluate the partnership, at the end of which the investors or Quanta may elect to end the investment period for any future investments or dissolve the partnership. Further, our relationship with a customer or investor that partners with us in a poorly performing investment could become impaired, which may negatively impact our ability to continue providing services to that customer.\nConflicts of interest may also exist or arise for us in relation to our investment partners as a result of the structure of our investment arrangements. For example, in these structures, Quanta can be the contractor for a project as well as an equity investor and possibly the manager of investments in that project. In those instances, conflicts of interest can exist for such things as contractor pricing and the handling of contractor change orders and other claims. While we have taken certain actions that we believe minimize or address these and other anticipated conflicts of interest, including through internal management practices and the terms of our agreements with investment partners, our failure to properly manage such conflicts of interest can expose us to liability or harm our relationships with investment partners, which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or cause reputational harm to Quanta.\nOur participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.\nWe have entered into joint venture arrangements and likely will continue to do so. The purpose of these joint ventures is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the bidding and performance of particular projects. Success on these projects can be adversely affected by the performance of our joint venture partners, over whom we may have little or no control. Differences in opinions or views between us and our joint venture partners may result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues that may adversely affect the business and operations of our joint ventures. Additionally, the failure by a joint venture partner to successfully perform or comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business.\nWe and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of a joint venture.\nIf a joint venture partner fails to perform or is unable to satisfy required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for their shortfall. Further, if our partners experience cost overruns or project performance issues that we are unable to adequately address, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation and reduce our profit or increase our loss on a project.\nWe extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and enter into other arrangements with certain of our customers, which subjects us to potential credit or investment risk.\nWe grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include utilities, energy companies, communications providers, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of renewable energy facilities and commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States, Canada, Australia and Latin America. In certain circumstances, we also allow our customers to defer payment until certain project milestones have been met or until a project is substantially completed, and customers typically withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage until a project is complete. In addition, we have provided in the past and may provide in the future other forms of financing to our customers or make investments in our customers\u2019 projects. These payment arrangements subject us to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors affecting our customers, and certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) in recent years, which has impacted our ability to collect amounts owed to us. If we are unable to collect such amounts, or retain amounts paid to us, our cash flows would be reduced, and we could experience losses if those amounts exceed current allowances. Business and economic factors resulting in financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) for our customers can also reduce the value of any financing or equity investment arrangements we have with our customers. The risk of loss may increase for projects where we provide services and make a financing or equity investment. Losses experienced as a result of these credit and investment risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks associated with operating in international markets and U.S. territories could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects.\nOur overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be negatively impacted by our activities and operations outside the continental United States, including our international operations and operations in U.S. territories. Although these operations are presently conducted primarily in Canada, Australia and Latin America, we also perform work in other foreign countries and U.S. territories and the number of locations we perform work in could increase in the future. Changes in economic conditions, including those resulting from wars and other conflicts, civil unrest, public health crises, such as the recent coronavirus, acts of terrorism, or volatility in global markets, may adversely affect demand for our services and our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our services. In addition, at times we are paid for work outside the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such payments may exceed our local currency needs, and, in certain instances, those amounts may be subject to temporary blocking, taxes or tariffs, and we may experience difficulties if we attempt to convert such amounts to U.S. dollars.\nThere are numerous other risks associated with operating in international markets, including, but not limited to, changes in applicable regulatory requirements; foreign currency exchange fluctuations; political, economic and social instability; expropriation or nationalization of our assets and operations; unfamiliar foreign legal systems and business practices; and complex U.S. and foreign tax regulations and other laws and international treaties. For example, as discussed in further detail in Legal Proceedings within Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the termination of a telecommunications project in Peru resulted in a $79.2 million charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2019. Furthermore, we may incur significant costs associated with an unsuccessful attempt to enter a new market, or we may enter a new market that ultimately proves to be unprofitable or has an otherwise adverse effect on our business. We may also incur significant costs or liabilities associated with winding down or exiting an existing market. For example, we have determined to pursue an orderly exit of our Latin American operations, which could result in significant costs or asset impairments during 2020 or in subsequent years.\nAdditionally, uncertain or changing economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, recent changes in U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the global economy. Increases in the cost of certain materials, including steel and aluminum, resulting from these and other trade policies may also impact customer spending. We cannot predict the outcome of these or other similar events, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or within our customers\u2019 specific markets. These risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers, operate our international business profitably or fund our strategic objectives, which could negatively impact our overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuating foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results.\nThe volume of services we provide internationally varies from year to year and our reported financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are exposed to the effects of fluctuating exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we\nderived $1.92 billion, or 15.9%, of our consolidated revenues from foreign operations, the substantial majority of which was earned in Canada and Australia. The functional currencies for our foreign operations are typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. Accordingly, our financial performance is subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, our translation of foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2019, foreign revenues decreased by approximately $57 million in comparison with the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates due primarily to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Canadian and Australian dollars. Furthermore, to the extent the volume of services we provide internationally increases, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be further exposed to the effects of fluctuating exchange rates.\nLimitations on the availability of suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers that we depend on could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations. Limitations on the availability of suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations, particularly in the event we rely on a single or small number of providers. The risk of a lack of available suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers can be heightened as a result of market, regulatory or economic conditions. For example, utilities in certain states, in order to receive certain funding, may expect us to engage a specified percentage of suppliers that meet diversity-ownership requirements, which can further limit our pool of available suppliers in those areas. Additionally, successful completion of our contracts can depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, fail to meet the expected completion dates or quality standards or fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be required to incur additional costs or provide additional services to mitigate such shortcomings.\nAn increase in the prices of certain materials used in our business or fuel prices could adversely affect our business.\nUnder certain contracts, including where we have assumed responsibility for procuring materials for a project, we are exposed to price increases for materials such as copper and steel, which are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in all of our operations. In addition, our customers\u2019 capital budgets can be negatively impacted by an increase in prices of certain materials. Prices could be materially impacted by general market conditions and other factors, including global trade relationships. For example, recent changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries, have resulted in uncertainty concerning availability and pricing of certain commodities and goods important to our and our customers\u2019 businesses, including steel and aluminum. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices, including as they relate to fuel prices for our large rolling-stock fleet of approximately 49,700 units. Furthermore, some of our fixed price contracts do not allow us to adjust our prices and, as a result, increases in material or fuel costs could reduce our profitability with respect to such projects.\nOur intellectual property rights may be unenforceable or become obsolete.\nWe utilize a variety of intellectual property rights while performing our services. We view our portfolio of proprietary energized services tools and techniques and other process and design technologies as competitive strengths, which we believe differentiate our service offerings. We also license certain technologies from third parties, and there is a risk that our relationships with such licensors may terminate or expire or may be interrupted or harmed. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings succeed against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. Further, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors and our customers with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nInvestors and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices of companies. While we have programs and initiatives in place related to our ESG practices, investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of our practices. In addition, our customers may require that we implement certain additional ESG procedures or standards before they will continue to do business with us. A failure to comply with investor or customer expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could also cause\nreputational harm to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, and unfavorable ratings of Quanta or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our costs of capital.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Compliance\nRegulatory requirements applicable to our industries and changes in current and potential legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect demand for our services.\nBecause the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries, the federal, state, provincial and local regulations affecting those industries, including, among other things, environmental, safety, and permitting requirements, have a material effect on our business. In recent years, our customers have faced heightened regulatory requirements and increased regulatory enforcement, which have resulted in delays, reductions in scope and cancellations of projects. Furthermore, certain regulatory requirements applicable to our customers are also required of us when we contract with such customers, and our inability to meet those requirements could also result in decreased demand for our services. Increased regulatory requirements have negatively impacted us and our customers and decreased demand for our services in the past, and may do so in the future, which can adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConcerns about climate-related issues could potentially result in new legislation, regulation, regulatory actions or other requirements at the local, state or federal level, any of which could negatively affect our customers and decrease demand for their services, result in increased costs associated with our operations, or impact the prices we charge our customers. For example, requirements to reduce, or taxes on the production and/or consumption of, fossil fuels could negatively impact the hydrocarbon production volumes of our customers, which could in turn negatively impact demand for our services. New regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources could also significantly increase our costs in light of our large rolling-stock fleet. In addition, if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could suffer.\nAdditionally, current and potential legislative or regulatory initiatives may not result in incremental increased demand for our services, including legislation and regulation that mandate percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources, require utilities to meet reliability standards, and encourage installation of new electric power transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. While these actions and initiatives have positively impacted demand for our services in the past, it is not certain whether they will continue to do so in the future. It is also uncertain as to whether proposed legislative initiatives that could be beneficial for our industries, including those designed to ease regulatory and permitting requirements, will be enacted.\nOur unionized workforce and related obligations may adversely affect our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 35% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. For a variety of reasons, our unionized workforce could adversely impact relationships with our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For instance, although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, certain of our unionized employees have participated in strikes and work stoppages in the past, and we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Our ability to complete future acquisitions also could be adversely affected because of our union status, including because our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire or because a business we want to acquire may not want to become affiliated with a union-based company. Additionally, certain of our customers require or prefer a non-union workforce, and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our non-union labor crews become unionized.\nOur collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multiemployer pension plans. To the extent a plan is underfunded, we may be subject to substantial liabilities if we withdraw or are deemed to withdraw from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. For example, we have been involved in several litigation matters associated with our withdrawal from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan, certain of which were settled in 2017. Further, special funding and operational rules are generally applicable to multiemployer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan\u2019s funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency). Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status, which may require additional contributions from employers (e.g., a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which we contribute or may contribute in the future are in \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status, and we may be obligated to contribute material amounts to these plans in the future, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities.\nApplicable U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), prohibit us from, among other things, corruptly making payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with these laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws and our procedures and practices are designed to ensure that our employees and intermediaries comply with these laws. However, there can be no assurance that such policies, procedures and practices will protect us from liability under the FCPA or other similar laws for actions or inadvertences by our employees or intermediaries. Liability for such actions or inadvertences could result in severe criminal or civil fines, penalties, forfeitures, disgorgements or other sanctions. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of such laws can be expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management, in-country management, and other personnel.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws, treaties and regulations and changes in existing tax laws, treaties and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, which can result in significant changes to the tax rate on our earnings and have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors, including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our tax rate can have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant liabilities and increased costs.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage, water quality and air quality. We perform work in many different types of underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain pollutants. These objects may also rupture, resulting in the discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may be liable for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information. We perform work, including directional drilling, in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such work may cause the release of subsurface materials that contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines. We also own and lease facilities that contain above- and below-ground fuel storage tanks. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for remediation costs and fines. The obligations, liabilities, fines and costs associated with these and other events can be material and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities.\nIn certain instances, we have obtained indemnification and other rights from third parties (including predecessors or lessors) for such obligations and liabilities; however, these indemnities may not cover all of our costs and indemnitors may not pay amounts owed to us. Further, in connection with an acquisition, we cannot be certain that we identify all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business when we are negotiating an indemnification right.\nCertain regulatory requirements applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries could materially impact our business.\nWe are subject to various specific regulatory regimes and requirements that could result in significant compliance costs and liabilities. As a public company, we are subject to the corporate governance and financial reporting requirements of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion on the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019; however, there can be no assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will be determined to be effective in future years. Failure to maintain effective internal controls or to identify significant internal control deficiencies in acquired businesses (both prior acquisitions and future acquisitions) could result in a decrease in the market value of our publicly traded securities, a reduced ability to obtain debt and equity financing, a loss of customers, fines or penalties, and/or additional expenditures to meet the requirements or remedy any deficiencies.\nOne of our subsidiaries has registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act). The Advisers Act and the rules promulgated thereunder impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of this subsidiary, including certain fiduciary duties that apply to its relationships with its advisory clients. The SEC has broad administrative powers to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser\u2019s registration. This subsidiary is also subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements, including, among other things, maintaining an effective compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements and complying with anti-fraud prohibitions. The failure of our subsidiary to comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions against our subsidiary that could have a material adverse effect on us. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a fine or sanction or if a fine or sanction imposed against our subsidiary or its employees were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur wholly-owned captive insurance company is a registered insurance broker with the Texas Department of Insurance, and therefore is subject to various rules and regulations and required to meet certain capital requirements, which can result in additional use of our resources.\nWe own and operate a postsecondary educational institution that specializes in pre-apprenticeship training, apprenticeship training and specialized utility task training for electric workers, as well as training for the pipeline and industrial and communications industries. In order to operate, each of the institution\u2019s campuses must be authorized by the state education agency where the campus is located, and the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially by state and can be extensive. If any of our campuses fail to comply with state licensing requirements, they may be unable to offer their programs and forced to close, which could result in harm to our reputation or negatively impact our ability to train skilled personnel that can be utilized to support our industry. Additionally, because our institution operates in a highly regulated industry, it is subject to compliance reviews and lawsuits or claims by government agencies and third parties. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations on the operations of the institution, injunctions or other penalties. The postsecondary educational institution is also accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges. Loss of accreditation could result in reputational harm or student-initiated litigation or negatively impact our ability to train skilled personnel that can be utilized to support our business.\nWe collect and retain information about our customers, stockholders, vendors and employees. New legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as contractual commitments, affect how we must store, use, transfer and process the confidential information of our employees, customers, vendors and stockholders. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA) was signed into law in 2018 and largely took effect in January 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and enhanced consumer protections for those individuals, and provides for statutory fines for data security breaches or other CCPA violations. Meanwhile, over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the CCPA. These laws, as well as other new or changing legislative, regulatory or contractual requirements concerning data privacy and protection, could require us to expend significant additional compliance costs, and any failure to comply with such requirements can result in significant liability or harm to our reputation.\nOpportunities within the government arena could subject us to increased regulation and costs and may pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.\nMost government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process, which can often be more time consuming than the bidding process for non-governmental projects. Additionally, involvement with government contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any revenues are realized. We are also subject to numerous procurement rules and other public sector regulations when we contract with certain governmental agencies, any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business. Government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors. Government agencies may review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If a government agency determines that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts, such costs will not be reimbursed or a refund of previously reimbursed costs may be required. If a government agency alleges or proves improper activity, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and serious reputational harm could result. Many government contracts must be appropriated each year, and without re-appropriation we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts.\nAdditionally, U.S. government shutdowns or any related under-staffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders, could limit the government\u2019s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments, and could limit our ability to perform on our existing U.S. government contracts and successfully compete for new work.\nImmigration laws, including our inability to verify employment eligibility and restrictions on movement of our foreign employees, could adversely affect our business or reputation.\nWe employ a significant number of employees, and while we utilize processes to assist in verifying the employment eligibility of potential new employees so that we maintain compliance with applicable laws, it is possible some of our employees may be unauthorized workers. In addition, we utilize certain non-immigrant visas to allow us to temporarily transfer certain of our foreign employees to the United States. The employment of unauthorized workers or failure to comply with the requirements of these non-immigrant visas could subject us to fines, penalties and other costs, as well as result in adverse publicity that negatively impacts our reputation and brand and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Furthermore, to the extent we are subject to penalties that prevent the future transfer of our foreign employees to the United States, we may incur additional costs to hire and train new employees. Immigration laws have also been an area of considerable political focus in recent years, and, from time-to-time, the U.S. government considers or implements changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring and employee transfer processes more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees.\nWe may incur additional healthcare costs.\nThe costs of employee health care insurance in the U.S. has increased in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. We cannot predict what other health care legislation or regulations will be implemented at the federal or state level, including whether the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 will be repealed and/or replaced, or the impact of any such future legislation or regulations. A continued increase in health care costs or related costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nWe may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations.\nIf we cannot secure future funds or financing on acceptable terms or generate sufficient cash flow, we may be unable to support our future operations or growth strategy. The timing of our funding needs and the size of our operations and strategic initiatives that require capital cannot be readily predicted and may be substantial. The use of cash on hand, cash from operations and cash from our senior secured credit facility to fund these initiatives can limit our financial flexibility and increase our need to seek capital through additional debt or equity financings. We also rely on financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our equipment, and credit market conditions may restrict access to capital for the leasing of additional equipment. A lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could negatively impact our future operations.\nThe credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility contains certain restrictions, including financial covenants and other restrictions on our ability to borrow amounts under the agreement and limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or conduct certain types of preferred equity financings. Our ability to increase the current commitments under our senior secured credit facility is also dependent upon additional commitments from our lenders. Furthermore, if we are permitted to seek additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain they will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, as banks are often restrictive in their lending practices, and additional debt financing may include covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we are unable to borrow under our senior secured credit facility or secure other financing or if our lenders become unable or unwilling to fund their commitments to us, we may not be able to access the capital needed to fund our growth and operations. For additional information on the terms of our senior secured credit facility, please read Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt Instruments - Credit Facility.\nAdditionally, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may fluctuate significantly in the future, in response to various factors, including events beyond our control, which could impact our ability to utilize capital markets to obtain funds. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including overall market conditions or volatility, actual or perceived negative financial results or other unfavorable information relating to us or our market peers, and the other risks described in this Annual Report.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk.\nBorrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Our weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 3.8%. The annual effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would be approximately $6.7 million based on our December 31, 2019 balance of variable rate debt.\nAdditionally, to address the transition in financial markets away from the London Interest Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) by the end of 2021, our senior secured credit facility agreement includes provisions related to the replacement of LIBOR with a LIBOR Successor Rate (as defined in the credit agreement for such facility). Changing to an alternative interest rate may lead to additional volatility in interest rates and could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined at the time certain circumstances are present, the lenders\u2019 obligation to make or maintain loans based on a Eurocurrency rate could be suspended, and loans in U.S. dollars would default to the Base Rate (as described in Senior Secured Credit Facility within Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) rather than a rate using the Eurocurrency Rate. If this were to occur, our available liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be unable to compete for certain projects if we are not able to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or bank guarantees.\nA portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances. Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties\u2019 assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers and lenders to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work and could increase our costs associated with collateral. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, letters of credit or guarantees, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders or finding more business that does not require bonds or that allows for other forms of collateral for project performance, such as cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances.\nWe have also granted security interests in certain assets to collateralize our obligations to our sureties and lenders. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that require bonding.\nOur ability to access capital markets could be limited.\nFrom time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain financing. Our ability to access capital markets for financing could be limited by, among other things, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, the state of the economy, the health of our industries, and the liquidity of the capital markets. Many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur sale or issuance of additional common stock or other equity-related securities could dilute each stockholder\u2019s ownership interest or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe often fund a significant portion of the consideration paid in connection with our acquisitions with the issuance of additional equity securities, including contingent consideration amounts payable if acquired businesses achieve certain performance objectives during specified post-acquisition periods. We also utilize stock-based compensation as a key component of our compensation program. We expect to issue additional equity securities in the future in connection with these and other practices. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we may issue up to 600,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 142,324,318 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Any additional issuances of common stock would have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and our existing stockholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages and lead to volatility in the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future issuances of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will declare or pay future dividends on our common stock.\nThe declaration, amount and timing of future dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to declare and pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, current and anticipated expansion plans, requirements under Delaware law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a material negative effect on our stock price.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult.\nThe following provisions of our charter documents, as currently in effect, and Delaware law could discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock:\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws;\n\u2022\nour bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent; and\n\u2022\nwe are subject to provisions of Delaware law which restrict us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder.", "PERMNO": 85792, "SIC": 1731, "TIC": "PWR"}
