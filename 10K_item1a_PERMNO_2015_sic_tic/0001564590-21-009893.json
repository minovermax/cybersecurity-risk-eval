{"cik": "1720592", "company": "Repay Holdings Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves significant risks. In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d you should carefully consider the specific risks set forth herein. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As a result, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additionally, the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any document incorporated by reference herein are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business.\nUnless the context requires otherwise, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cRepay\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d refer to the business of Repay Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries. In the sections of the Risk Factors entitled \u201cRisks Related to Our Ownership Structure\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d us\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer only to Repay Holdings Corporation excluding, unless the context requires otherwise or as expressly stated, its subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus on our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and largely without precedent.\nWe continue to face various risks related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), which the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments and other parties to attempt to control its spread have adversely impacted the U.S. and global economy, leading to reduced consumer and business spending, reduced economic activity and disruptions and volatility in the U.S. and\nglobal capital markets. We are diligently working to ensure that we can continue to operate with minimal disruption, mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our employees\u2019 health and safety, and address potential business interruptions on ourselves and our customers. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in these efforts.\nAlthough we have experienced increased demand for some of our service offerings as a result of an accelerated shift to electronic payments, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic, the mitigation efforts and the resulting economic impact have had, and may continue to have, an overall adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The actual full effect (which could be material) cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, and it will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak (including whether there are continued waves of infection); the nature, extent and effectiveness of mitigation measures; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, unemployment, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We believe that the resulting financial impact on our business, results of operations and financial conditions will not be known for a significant period of time.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mitigation efforts and the resulting economic impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition have included and may continue to include the following with respect to the key industry-oriented \u201cvertical\u201d markets that we serve:\n\u2022\nA decrease in the origination of personal or automotive loans and a decrease in payments (from delinquencies, defaults or otherwise) made in respect of existing obligations as a result of government-imposed or suggested \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or similar orders, significant reductions in consumer spending, high unemployment, bankruptcies, financial distress or loan payoffs made following additional government stimulus or extra unemployment benefits.\n\u2022\nA reduction in the amount of loan payments received as a result of loan payment deferrals (whether government-mandated or voluntary).\n\u2022\nDecreased receivables management payments as a result of moratoriums on debt collection activities.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the amount of business-to-business payments as a result of the overall economic slowdown and reduction in business spending.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the amount of payments to healthcare providers from insurance companies and third-party health administrators as a result of reductions in elective medical procedures or health provider visits.\nThe above effects are likely to result in an adverse impact on the amount of fees we can earn for processing payments and other transactions on behalf of our customers. There may be a delay in the timing of when our business is impacted by these matters. As an example, we could earn incremental fees from processing loan payments or payoffs that result from consumers\u2019 receipt of additional government stimulus or extra unemployment benefits, but our business, results of operations and financial condition in subsequent periods could be adversely affected if customers in our personal or automotive loan verticals reduce their loan originations as result of such combination of government action and consumer behavior.\nIn addition, the ongoing suspension of non-essential travel and cancellation or postponement of various tradeshows is expected to continue to result in challenges in attracting new customers and growing relationships with existing customers.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic, the mitigation efforts and the resulting economic impact adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, such matters may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors disclosed herein, such as those relating to our responsibility for the prevention of unauthorized disclosure of consumer data and our ability to minimize losses relating to chargebacks, fraud and similar losses.\nThe payment processing industry is highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect the fees we receive, and as a result, our margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for payment processing services is highly competitive. There are other payment processing service providers that have established a sizable market share in the markets in which we compete and service more customers than we do. Our growth will depend, in part, on a combination of the continued growth of the electronic payment market and our ability to increase our market share.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, management and marketing resources than we have. Accordingly, if these competitors target our business model and, in particular, the vertical markets that we serve, they may be able to offer more attractive fees or payment terms and advances to our customers and more attractive compensation to our software integration partners. They also may be able to offer and provide services and solutions that we do not offer. There are also a large number of small providers of processing services, including emerging technology and non-traditional payment processing companies, that provide various ranges of services to our existing and potential customers. This competition may effectively limit the prices we can charge, cause us to increase the compensation we pay to our software integration partners and require us to control costs aggressively in order to maintain acceptable profit margins.\nUnauthorized disclosure of merchant or consumer data, whether through breach of our computer systems, computer viruses, or otherwise, could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, and damage our reputation.\nWe are responsible for data security for us and for third parties with whom we partner, including with respect to rules and regulations established by the payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover, and debit card networks. These third parties include our customers, software integration partners and other third-party service providers and agents. We and other third parties collect, process, store and/or transmit sensitive data, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, driver\u2019s license numbers, bank account numbers, and protected health information. We have ultimate liability to the payment networks and our sponsor banks that register us with the payment networks for our failure or the failure of other third parties with whom we contract to protect this data in accordance with payment network requirements. The loss, destruction or unauthorized modification of merchant or consumer data by us or our contracted third parties could result in significant fines, sanctions, proceedings or actions against us by the payment networks, governmental bodies, consumers or others.\nThreats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or from accidental technological failure. For example, certain of our employees have access to sensitive data that could be used to commit identity theft or fraud. Concerns about security increase when we transmit information electronically because such transmissions can be subject to attack, interception or loss. Also, computer viruses can be distributed and spread rapidly over the Internet and could infiltrate our systems or those of our contracted third parties. Denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes, including interfering with our services or to create a diversion for other malicious activities. These types of actions and attacks and others could disrupt our delivery of services or make them unavailable.\nWe and our contracted third parties could be subject to breaches of security by hackers. Our encryption of data and other protective measures may not prevent unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data. A systems breach may subject us to material losses or liability, including payment network fines, assessments and claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated credit, debit or card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity breach could harm our reputation and deter merchants or other customers from using electronic payments generally and our services specifically, thus reducing our revenue. In addition, any such misuse or breach could cause us to incur costs to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, and result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under state and federal laws or by the payment networks or limitations on our ability to process payment transactions on such payment networks. While we maintain cyber insurance coverage (which, in certain cases, is required pursuant to certain of our contractual commitments) that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of these risks, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. Additionally, we may be required to increase our cyber insurance coverage pursuant to our contractual commitments entered into in the future. The costs to maintain or increase our cyber insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny human error, fraud, malice, accidental technological failure or attacks against us or our contracted third parties could hurt our reputation, force us to incur significant expenses in remediating the resulting impacts, expose us to uninsured liability, result in the loss of our sponsor bank relationships or our ability to participate in the payment networks, subject us to lawsuits, fines or sanctions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business and/or materially impede our ability to conduct business.\nAlthough we generally require that our agreements with our software integration partners or service providers include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any merchant or consumer data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements, we cannot guarantee that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized use, modification, destruction or disclosure of data or allow us to seek reimbursement from the contracted party. In addition, many of our customers are small and medium-sized businesses that may have limited competency regarding data security and handling requirements and may thus experience data breaches. Any unauthorized\nuse, modification, destruction or disclosure of data could result in protracted and costly litigation, and the incurrence of significant losses by us.\nIn addition, our agreements with our sponsor banks and our third-party payment processors (as well as payment network requirements) require us to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of merchant and consumer data. Any failure to adequately comply with these protective measures could result in fees, penalties, litigation or termination of our sponsor bank agreements.\nSecurity breaches may be subject to scrutiny from governmental agencies such as the CFPB, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. See \u201cRisks Related to Regulation\u201d below.\nIf we cannot keep pace with rapid developments and changes in our industry, the use of our products and services could decline, causing a reduction in our revenues.\nThe electronic payments market is subject to constant and significant changes. This market is characterized by rapid technological evolution, new product and service introductions, evolving industry standards, changing customer needs and the entrance of new competitors, including products and services that enable card networks and banks to transact with consumers directly. To remain competitive, we continually pursue initiatives to develop new products and services to compete with these new market entrants. These projects carry risks, such as difficulty in determining market demand and timing for delivery, cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of customer acceptance, and some projects may require investment in non-revenue generating products or services that our software integration partners and customers expect to be included in our offerings. In addition, new products and offerings may not perform as intended or generate the business or revenue growth expected.\nThe continued growth and development of our payment processing services and solutions will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer and business behavior. Any failure to timely integrate emerging payment methods into our software, to anticipate consumer or business behavior changes or to contract with processing partners that support such emerging payment technologies could cause us to lose traction among our customers or referral sources, including industry associations, resulting in a corresponding loss of revenue, if those methods become popular among end-users of their services.\nOur products and services are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. Our technology offerings must also integrate with a variety of network, hardware, mobile and software platforms and technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to adapt to changes and innovation in these technologies. Any failure to deliver an effective, reliable and secure service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. If we do not deliver a promised new product or service to our customers or software integration partners in a timely manner or the product or service does not perform as anticipated, our development efforts could result in increased costs and a loss in business, reducing our earnings and causing a loss of revenue. We also rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to, or production of, new technologies, including software and hardware. For example, we rely on our software integration partners to integrate our services and products into the software platforms being used by our customers. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to develop, adapt to or access technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our vertical markets do not increase their acceptance of electronic payments or if there are adverse developments in the electronic payment industry in general, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe vertical markets we primarily serve have traditionally not utilized electronic payments. If consumers and businesses in these vertical markets do not increase their use of cards as payment methods for their transactions or if the mix of payment methods changes in a way that is adverse to us, such developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory changes may also result in our customers seeking to charge their own customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards which may result in such customers using other payment methods. Additionally, in recent years, increased incidents of security breaches have caused some consumers to lose confidence in the ability of businesses to protect their information, causing certain consumers to discontinue use of electronic payment methods. Security breaches could result in financial institutions canceling large numbers of credit and debit cards, or consumers or businesses electing to cancel their cards following such incidents.\nPotential customers or software integration partners may be reluctant to switch to, or develop a relationship with, a new payment processor, which may adversely affect our growth.\nMany potential customers and software integration partners worry about potential disadvantages associated with switching payment processing providers, such as a loss of accustomed functionality, increased costs and business disruption. There can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential reluctance to change payment processing providers or to initiate a relationship with us will be successful, and this resistance may adversely affect our growth and our business overall.\nIf we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of payment networks and industry self-regulatory organizations, those payment networks or organizations could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations through our sponsor banks.\nWe rely on sponsor banks and, in certain cases, third-party processors to access the payment card networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover, that enable our ability to offer to our customers the acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, and we must pay fees for such services. To provide our merchant acquiring services, we are registered through our sponsor banks with the Visa, MasterCard and Discover networks as a service provider for member institutions. As such, we, our sponsor banks and many of our customers are subject to complex and evolving payment network rules. The payment networks routinely update and modify requirements applicable to merchant acquirers, including rules regulating data integrity, third-party relationships (such as those with respect to sponsor banks and independent sales organization (\u201cISOs\u201d)), merchant chargeback standards and PCI DSS. The rules of the card networks are set by their boards, which may be influenced by card issuers, some of which offer competing transaction processing services. Any changes in payment network rules or standards may be imposed on highly compressed timelines and may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we or our sponsor banks fail to comply with the applicable rules and requirements of any of the payment networks, such payment network could suspend or terminate our registration. Further, our transaction processing capabilities, including with respect to settlement processes, could be delayed or otherwise disrupted, and recurring non-compliance could result in the payment networks seeking to fine us or suspend or terminate our registrations that allow us to process transactions on their networks, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale.\nUnder certain circumstances specified in the payment network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments with regard to our compliance with the PCI DSS. Such audits or assessments may reveal that we have failed to comply with the PCI DSS. In addition, even if we comply with the PCI DSS, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. The termination of our registrations with the payment networks, or any changes in payment network or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide merchant acquiring services, could have an adverse effect on our payment processing volumes, revenues and operating costs. If we are unable to comply with the requirements applicable to our payment processing activities, the payment networks could no longer allow us to provide these solutions, which would render us unable to conduct our business. If we were precluded from processing Visa and MasterCard electronic payments, we would lose a substantial portion of our revenues.\nWe are also subject to the operating rules of the NACHA. NACHA is a self-regulatory organization which administers and facilitates private-sector operating rules for ACH payments and defines the roles and responsibilities of financial institutions and other ACH network participants. The NACHA Rules and Operating Guidelines impose obligations on us and our partner financial institutions. These obligations include audit and oversight by the financial institutions and the imposition of mandatory corrective action, including termination, for serious violations. If an audit or self-assessment under PCI DSS or NACHA identifies any deficiencies that we need to remediate, the remediation efforts may distract our management team and be expensive and time consuming.\nWe rely on sponsor banks in order to process electronic payment transactions, and such sponsor banks have substantial discretion with respect to certain elements of our business practices. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are not able to secure new sponsor banks, we will not be able to conduct our business.\nBecause we are not a bank, we are not eligible for membership in the Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks, and are, therefore, unable to directly access these payment networks, which are required to process transactions. We are currently registered with payment networks through our sponsor banks.\nIf these sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure a replacement sponsor bank within the applicable wind down period, we will not be able to process electronic payment transactions. While we maintain relationships with multiple sponsor banks for flexibility in the processing of payment volume and in the pricing of our customers\u2019 solutions, the\nloss of or termination of a relationship with a sponsor bank or a significant decrease in the amount of payment volume that a sponsor bank processes for us could reduce such flexibility and negatively affect our business. To the extent the number of our sponsor banks decreases, we will become increasingly reliant on our remaining sponsor banks, which would materially adversely affect our business should our relationship with any of such remaining banks be terminated or otherwise disrupted. Furthermore, our agreements with our sponsor banks provide the sponsor banks with substantial discretion in approving certain elements of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and underwriting procedures for merchants. Our sponsor banks\u2019 actions under these agreements could be detrimental to us.\nTo acquire and retain customers, we depend on our software integration partners that integrate our services and solutions into software used by our customers.\nWe rely heavily on the efforts of our software integration partners to ensure our services and solutions are properly integrated into the software that our customers use. Generally, our agreements with software integration partners are not exclusive and these partners retain the right to refer potential customers to other payment processors.\nWe may need to provide financial concessions to maintain relationships with current software integration partners or to attract potential software integration partners from our competitors. We have been required, and expect to be required in the future, to make concessions when renewing contracts with our software integration partners, and such concessions can have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance.\nIf our software integration partners focus more heavily on working with other payment processors, cease operations or become insolvent, we may be at risk of losing existing customers with whom these software integration partners have relationships. If we are unable to maintain our existing base of software integration partners or develop relationships with new software integration partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. In addition, our efforts to form relationships with new software integration partners may be hindered to the extent they perceive that integrating with a new payment processor or switching to us from another payment processor is too costly or time-consuming. Many software providers choose to integrate with only a small number of payments processors due to the requisite time and cost of integrating their systems with a payment processor\u2019s solutions.\nFailure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback liability and other liability.\nWe are potentially liable for losses caused by fraudulent card transactions or business fraud. Card fraud occurs when a merchant\u2019s customer uses a stolen card (or a stolen card number in a card-not-present transaction) to purchase merchandise or services. In a traditional card-present transaction, if the merchant swipes the card, receives authorization for the transaction from the card issuing bank and verifies the signature on the back of the card against the paper receipt signed by its customer, the card issuing bank remains liable for any loss. In a fraudulent card-not-present transaction, even if the merchant receives authorization for the transaction, the merchant may be liable for any loss arising from the transaction. In addition, consumers may dispute repayments on a loan by claiming it was unlawful under applicable law.\nBusiness fraud occurs when a business or organization, rather than a cardholder, opens a fraudulent merchant account and conducts fraudulent transactions or when a business, rather than a consumer (though sometimes working together with a consumer engaged in fraudulent activities), knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit card or card number to record a false sales transaction, intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction, or provides services in violation of applicable law. Business fraud also occurs when employees of businesses change the business demand deposit accounts to their personal bank account numbers, so that payments are improperly credited to the employee\u2019s personal account.\nCertain of these types of fraud present potential liability for chargebacks associated with our customers\u2019 processing transactions. If a billing dispute between a customer and a consumer is not ultimately resolved in favor of our customer, the disputed transaction is \u201ccharged back\u201d to the customer\u2019s bank and credited to the consumer\u2019s bank. Anytime our customer is unable to satisfy a chargeback, we are responsible for that chargeback. We have a number of contractual protections and other means of recourse to mitigate those risks, including collateral or reserve accounts that we may require our customers to maintain for these types of contingencies. Nonetheless, if we are unable to collect the chargeback from the customers\u2019 account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the customer refuses or is financially unable due to bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for the chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder\u2019s bank. We have established systems and procedures to detect and reduce the impact of business fraud, but these measures may not be effective, and incidents of fraud could increase in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe our chargeback rate was less than 1% of payment volume. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur processes to reduce fraud losses depend in part on our ability to restrict the deposit of processing funds while we investigate suspicious transactions. We could be sued by parties alleging that our restriction and investigation processes violate federal and state laws on consumer protection and unfair business practice. If we are unable to defend any such claim successfully, we could be required to restructure our anti-fraud processes in ways that would harm our business or pay substantial fines.\nAs part of our program to reduce fraud losses, we may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to access certain processing deposits if those transactions or their account activity are identified by our anti-fraud models as suspicious. We could be sued by parties alleging that our restriction and investigation processes violate federal and state laws on consumer protection and unfair business practice. If we are unable to defend any such claim successfully, we could be required to restructure our anti-fraud processes in ways that could harm our business, and to pay substantial fines. Even if we are able to defend a claim successfully, the litigation could damage our reputation, consume substantial amounts of our management\u2019s time and attention, and require us to change our customer service and operations in ways that could increase our costs and decrease the effectiveness of our anti-fraud program.\nWe receive savings related to favorable pricing on interchange and other payment network fees. To the extent we cannot maintain such savings and cannot pass along any corresponding increases in such fees to our customers, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe bear interchange, assessment, transaction and other fees set by the payment networks to the card issuing banks and the payment networks for each transaction we process as a merchant acquirer. Under certain circumstances, the payment networks afford us preferential rates with respect to such fees, which helps us to control our operating costs. From time to time, the payment networks increase the interchange fees and other fees that they charge payment processors and the sponsor banks. At their sole discretion, our sponsor banks have the right to pass any increases in interchange and other fees on to us, and they have consistently done so in the past. We are generally permitted under the contracts into which we enter with our customers, and in the past have been able to, pass these fee increases along to our customers through corresponding increases in our processing fees. However, if we are unable to pass through these and other fees in the future, or if the payment networks decline to offer us preferential rates on such fees as compared to those charged to other payment processors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements on us, such as reserves in respect of certain customers for chargeback liabilities. Any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes.\nOur systems and those of our third-party providers may fail due to factors beyond our control, which could interrupt our service, resulting in our inability to process payments or provide ancillary services, loss of business, increase in costs and exposure to liability.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of numerous systems, including our computer network systems, software, data centers and telecommunication networks, as well as the systems and services of our sponsor banks, the payment networks, third-party providers of processing services and other third parties. Our systems and operations, or those of our third-party providers, such as our provider of dial-up authorization services, or the payment networks themselves, could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, telecommunications failure, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, unauthorized entry, computer viruses or other malware, human error, natural disaster, power loss, acts of terrorism or sabotage, financial insolvency of such providers and similar events. These threats, and errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, system outages or other difficulties, could result in failure to process transactions or provide ancillary services, additional operating and development costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of revenue, customers and software integration partners, loss of merchant and cardholder data, harm to our business or reputation, exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities and fines and other sanctions imposed by payment networks. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.\nAt present, our critical operational systems, such as our payment gateway, are fully redundant, while certain of our less critical systems are not. Therefore, certain aspects of our operations may be subject to interruption. Also, while we have disaster recovery policies and arrangements in place, they have not been tested under actual disasters or similar events. Maintaining and upgrading our system is costly and time-consuming, involves significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no assurances that such systems will be effective. Frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices.\nIn addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on other service and technology providers. If such providers fail in or discontinue providing their services or technology to us, our ability to provide services to customers may be interrupted, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on third parties to provide or supplement card processing services and for infrastructure hosting services. We also rely on third parties for specific software and hardware used in providing our products and services. The termination by our service or technology providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and, if we cannot find alternate providers quickly, may cause those customers to terminate their relationships with us.\nOur third-party processors and third-party program managers, which provide us with front-end authorization services, card issuance program services and certain other services, compete with us or may compete with us in the future in the vertical markets that we serve. There can be no assurance that these processors will maintain their relationships with us in the future or that they will refrain from competing directly with the solutions that we offer.\nIf we are unable to renew our existing contracts with our most significant vendors, we might not be able to replace the related products or services at the same cost, which would negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, while we believe we would be able to locate alternative vendors to provide substantially similar services at comparable rates, or otherwise replicate such services internally, no assurance can be made that a change would not be disruptive to our business, which could potentially lead to a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability until resolved.\nWe also rely in part on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies, and updates to existing products and services for which third parties provide ongoing support, which reliance increases the cost associated with new and existing product and service offerings. Failure by these third-party providers to devote an appropriate level of attention to our products and services could result in delays in introducing new products or services, or delays in resolving any issues with existing products or services for which third-party providers provide ongoing support.\nWe are subject to economic and political risk, the business cycles of our customers and software integration partners and the overall level of consumer and commercial spending, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe electronic payment industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer and commercial spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits, including natural disasters and health emergencies, including earthquakes, fires, power outages, typhoons, floods, pandemics or epidemics such as the coronavirus and manmade events such as civil unrest, labor disruption, international trade disputes, international conflicts, terrorism, wars and critical infrastructure attacks. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States, continued uncertainty for an extended period of time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, or increases in interest rates, could adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or aggregate volume of transactions made using electronic payments. If our customers make fewer sales of products and services using electronic payments, or consumers and businesses spend less money through electronic payments, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts, resulting in lower revenue.\nThe weakening in the economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have various types of impact on our business. See the risk factor entitled \u201cThe continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus on our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and largely without precedent.\u201d\nIn addition, a significant portion of our customers are consumer lenders that provide personal loans and automotive loans to consumers that have varying degrees of credit risk. The regulatory environment that these customers operate in is very complex because applicable regulations are often enacted by multiple agencies in the state and federal governments. For example, the CFPB previously proposed new rules applicable to such loans that could have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 businesses, and numerous state laws impose similar requirements. Such customers are also subject to negative public perceptions that their consumer lending activities constitute predatory or abusive lending to consumers, and concerns\nraised by consumer advocacy groups and government officials may lead to efforts to further regulate the industry in which many of our customers operate. The combination of these factors, and in particular any changes implemented at the CFPB under the Biden administration, could materially adversely affect the business of our customers and may force our consumer lender customers to change their business models. As a result, we may need to be nimble and quickly respond to the evolving needs of the vertical markets that we serve. If the business of our customers is materially adversely affected by the uncertainties described above and if we or our customers fail to respond to such changes in the industry in a timely manner, or if there are significant changes in such vertical markets that we do not anticipate, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risks.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing industry. Accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor, manage and remediate our risks. Some of our risk evaluation methods depend upon information provided by others and public information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are otherwise inaccessible by us. In some cases, that information may not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. Additionally, our risk detection system is subject to a high degree of \u201cfalse positive\u201d risks being detected, which makes it difficult for us to identify real risks in a timely manner. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in capturing all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that materially increase our costs and limit our ability to grow and may cause us to lose existing customers.\nWe may not be able to continue to expand our share in our existing vertical markets or continue to expand into new vertical markets, which would inhibit our ability to grow and increase our profitability.\nOur future growth and profitability depend, in part, upon our continued expansion within the vertical markets in which we currently operate, the emergence of other vertical markets for electronic payments and our integrated solutions, and our ability to penetrate new vertical markets and our current software integration partners\u2019 customer bases. As part of our strategy to expand into new vertical markets and increase our share in our existing vertical markets, we look for acquisition opportunities and partnerships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or partnership candidates in the future, and if we do identify them, they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated. In addition, our ability to continue to grow and profitably service customers in Canada is uncertain and will require additional resources and controls, and we may encounter unanticipated challenges.\nOur expansion into new vertical markets also depends on our ability to adapt our existing technology or to develop new technologies to meet the particular needs of each new vertical market. We may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services or distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new vertical markets. Penetrating these new vertical markets may also prove to be more challenging or costly or may take longer than we may anticipate. If we fail to expand into new vertical markets and increase our penetration into existing vertical markets, we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology, which is critical to our success, particularly in our strategic verticals where we may offer proprietary software solutions to our customers. Third parties have and in the future may challenge, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of service offerings or other competitive harm. Other parties, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology and duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property and, in such cases, we may not be able to assert our intellectual property rights against such parties. Further, our contractual arrangements may be subject to termination or renegotiation with unfavorable terms to us, and our third-party licensors may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other adverse business dynamics, any of which might affect our ability to use and exploit the products licensed to us by such third-party licensors. Additionally, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights and know-how, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, aspects of our business and our services rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or retain licenses and technologies from\nthese third parties on reasonable terms or at all. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to license or otherwise use third-party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe may also be subject to costly litigation if our services and technology are alleged to infringe upon or otherwise violate a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, services or technology. Any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement, breach or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights against us with respect to our products, services or technology. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have been purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement or other violations and attempting to extract settlements from companies like us. Even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. Claims of intellectual property infringement or violation also may require us to redesign affected products or services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or services. Even if we have an agreement for indemnification against such costs, the indemnifying party, if any in such circumstance, may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nThe loss of key personnel or the loss of our ability to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified employees, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing payment processing industry and the vertical markets in which we offer our products and services. Many of our key personnel have worked for us for a significant amount of time or were recruited by us specifically due to their experience. Our success depends in part upon the reputation and influence within the industry of our senior managers who have, over the years, developed long standing and favorable relationships with our software integration partners, vendors, card associations, sponsor banks and other payment processing and service providers. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, contractual obligations related to confidentiality and assignment of intellectual property rights may be ineffective or unenforceable, and departing employees may share our proprietary information with competitors or seek to solicit our software integration partners or customers or recruit our key personnel to competing businesses in ways that could adversely impact us.\nFurther, in order for us to continue to successfully compete and grow, we must attract, recruit, develop and retain personnel who will provide us with the expertise we need. Our success also depends on the skill and experience of our sales force, which we must continuously work to maintain. While we have a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, we must also develop our personnel so that our personnel is capable of maintaining the continuity of our operations, supporting the development of new services and solutions, and expanding our customer base. The market for qualified personnel is competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors.\nWe have been the subject of various claims and legal proceedings and may become the subject of claims, litigation or investigations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of various claims and legal proceedings and may become the subject of claims, litigation or investigations, including commercial disputes and employee claims, such as claims of age discrimination, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, immigration violations or other local, state and federal labor law violations, and from time to time may be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Any claims asserted against us or our management, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our relationships with our customers, software integration partners and other third parties and could lead to additional related claims. In light of the potential cost and uncertainty involved in litigation, we have in the past and may in the future settle matters even when we believe we have a meritorious defense. Certain claims may seek injunctive relief, which could disrupt the ordinary conduct of our business and operations or increase our costs of doing business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. Any judgments or settlements in any pending or future claims, litigation or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions.\nA significant part of our growth strategy is to enter into new vertical markets through platform acquisitions of vertically-focused integrated payment and software solutions providers, to expand within our existing vertical markets through selective tuck-in acquisitions and to otherwise increase our presence in the payments processing market.\nAlthough we expect to continue to execute our acquisition strategy:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional assets on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may compete with others to acquire assets, which competition may increase, and any level of competition could result in decreased availability or increased prices for acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\ncompeting bidders for such acquisitions may be larger, better-funded organizations with more resources and easier access to capital;\n\u2022\nwe may experience difficulty in anticipating the timing and availability of acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain the necessary financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approvals, which may cause delays and uncertainties; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to generate cash necessary to execute our acquisition strategy.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our growth strategy.\nOur acquisitions subject us to a variety of risks that could harm our business and the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions may not be realized on the expected timeline or at all.\nWe may experience various challenges associated with our acquired businesses, such as:\n\u2022\nwe may need to allocate substantial operational, financial and management resources in integrating new businesses, technologies and products, and management may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel or systems of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business relationships with existing or future customers or software integration partners;\n\u2022\nwe may assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities, known and unknown;\n\u2022\nthe acquisition may not meet our expectations of future financial performance on our expected timeline or at all;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays or reductions in realizing expected synergies or benefits;\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial unanticipated costs or encounter other problems associated with the acquired business, including challenges associated with transfer of various data processing functions and connections to our systems and those of our third-party service providers;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to retain the key personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired business.\nThese challenges and costs and expenses may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAs a result of unidentified issues or factors outside of our control, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. Unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis conducted. Even though these charges may be non-cash items that would not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate leverage or other covenants to which we may be subject. Accordingly, our stockholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares from any such write-down or write-downs.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive government regulation, and any new laws and regulations, industry standards or revisions made to existing laws, regulations or industry standards affecting our business, our customers\u2019 businesses or the electronic payments industry, or our or our customers\u2019 actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, may have an unfavorable impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and the customers we serve are subject to numerous federal and state regulations that affect the electronic payments industry. Regulation of our industry has increased significantly in recent years and is constantly evolving. Changes to statutes, regulations or industry standards, including interpretation and implementation of statutes, regulations or standards, could increase our cost of doing business or affect the competitive balance. Failure to comply with regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, including the limitation, suspension or termination of services provided to, or by, third parties, and the imposition of penalties or fines. To the extent these regulations negatively impact the business, operations or financial condition of our clients, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us, could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business, or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. We could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients; and those regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services. We may not be able to update our existing products and services, or develop new ones, to satisfy our customer\u2019 needs. Any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInterchange fees, which are typically paid to the card issuer in connection with credit and debit card transactions, are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the U.S. financial regulatory system by regulating and limiting debit card fees charged by certain issuers, allowing merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and allowing merchants to offer discounts or other incentives for different payment methods. These regulations (as well as any related modifications or changes in interpretation) could negatively affect the number of debit transactions, and prices charged per transaction, which would negatively affect our business.\nLaws and regulations, even if not directed at us, may require us to take significant efforts to change our services and solutions and may require that we incur additional compliance costs and change how we price our products and services to our customers and software integration partners. Implementing new compliance efforts is difficult because of the complexity of new regulatory requirements, and we are devoting and will continue to devote significant resources to ensure compliance. Furthermore, regulatory actions may precipitate changes in business practices by us and other industry participants which could affect how we market, price and distribute our products and services, and which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations or evolving public perceptions of our business could damage our business or our reputation.\nDepending on how our products and services evolve, we may be subject to a variety of additional laws and regulations, including those governing money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, restrictions on foreign assets, gambling, banking and lending, and import and export restrictions.\nOur efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In addition, to the extent we decide to offer our products and services in additional jurisdictions (for example, our expansion into Canada), we may incur additional compliance-related costs with respect to operating in such jurisdictions. Additionally, as our products and services evolve, and as regulators continue to\nincrease their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, we may be subject to a variety of additional laws and regulations, or we may be required to further revise or expand our compliance management system, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers, their end customers, and to monitor transactions. If we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties, such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to alter the nature or packaging of our services and solutions, any of which could adversely affect our business or operating results.\nThe businesses of many of our customers are strictly regulated in every jurisdiction in which they operate, and such regulations, and our customers\u2019 failure to comply with them, could have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 businesses and, as a result, our results of operations.\nOur customers are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations enacted by government entities at the federal, state and local levels. For our customers that are consumer lenders, this includes regulations relating to: the amount they may charge in interest rates and fees; the terms of their loans (such as maximum and minimum durations), repayment requirements and limitations, number and frequency of loans, maximum loan amounts, renewals and extensions, required repayment plans and reporting and use of state-wide databases; collection and servicing activity; the establishment and operation of their businesses; licensing, disclosure and reporting requirements; restrictions on advertising and marketing; and requirements governing electronic payments and money transmission. For our customers that operate in the healthcare industry, this includes regulations relating to: payment channels; payment scheduling; electronic health records; patient disclosures and communications; use and disclosure of protected health information; and administrative, physical, and technical security of protected health information.\nThese regulations affect our customers\u2019 businesses in many ways, including their loan or payment volume, revenues, delinquencies of their borrowers, payment channel decisions, payment scheduling and results of operations. These changes to these customers\u2019 businesses may affect the payment volume we process, including the number and size of scheduled payments and the channel of payments. To the extent these laws and regulations curtail consumer lending activity or healthcare payment activity, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to become licensed under state money transmission statutes.\nWe provide payment processing services through our various operating subsidiaries. We, along with our third party service providers, use structural arrangements designed to remove our activities from the scope of money transmitter regulation. There can be no assurance that these structural arrangements will remain effective as money transmitter laws continue to evolve or that the applicable regulatory bodies, particularly state agencies, will view our payment processing activities as compliant. Any determination that we are in fact required to be licensed under the state money transmission statutes may require substantial expenditures of time and money and could lead to liability in the nature of penalties or fines, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe and many of our customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices and various state laws that are similar in scope and subject matter. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, the Telemarketing Sales Act and other laws, rules and/or regulations, may directly impact the activities of certain of our customers, and in some cases may subject us, as the electronic payment processor or provider of payment settlement services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are found to have improperly aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of a customer through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the FTC and state attorneys general have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in UDAAP, or violate other laws, rules and regulations. To the extent we are processing payments or providing products and services for a customer suspected of violating such laws, rules and regulations, we may face enforcement actions and incur losses and liabilities that may adversely affect our business.\nGovernmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to or use of consumer information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our products and services.\nIn addition to those regulations discussed previously that are imposed by the card networks and NACHA, governmental bodies in the United States have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the use, collection, storage, transfer and disposal of, and requiring safeguarding of, non-public personal information. Our operations are subject to certain provisions of these laws. Applicable federal privacy laws may restrict our collection,\nprocessing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, may require us to notify individuals of our privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information, and mandate certain procedures with respect to safeguarding and proper description of stored information. Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches of personal information to affected individuals, state officers, consumer reporting agencies and businesses and governmental agencies. The applicable regulatory framework for privacy issues is evolving and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future, which creates uncertainty. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) of 2018, which became effective January 1, 2020, imposes more stringent requirements with respect to California data privacy. The CCPA includes provisions that give California residents expanded rights to access and delete certain personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how certain personal information is used. On November 2, 2020, California voters passed Proposition 24, enacting the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which will become effective on January 1, 2023. CPRA amends and expands the CCPA to create additional consumer privacy rights, such as the right of correction and the right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information.\nFurther, we are obligated by our customers, sponsor banks and software integration partners to maintain the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information that our customers and their end customers share with us. Our contracts may require periodic audits by independent parties regarding our compliance with applicable standards, and may permit our counterparties to audit our compliance with best practices established by regulatory guidelines with respect to confidentiality and security of non-public personal information. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract, grow and maintain business in the future, and any failure to do so could subject us to contractual liability, each of which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contractual terms, or if we experience security breaches, we could face regulatory enforcement proceedings, suits for breach of contract and monetary liabilities. Additionally, any such failure could harm the relationships and reputation we depend on to retain existing customers and software integration partners and obtain new customers and software integration partners. If federal and state governmental bodies adopt more restrictive privacy laws in the future, our compliance costs could increase, and it could make our due diligence reviews and monitoring regarding the risk of our customers more difficult, complex and expensive. As our business grows, we may also be required to invest in a more substantive and complex compliance management system than the one we currently employ.\nChanges in tax laws or their judicial or administrative interpretations, or becoming subject to additional U.S., state or local taxes that cannot be passed through to our customers, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their judicial or administrative interpretations could decrease the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount of our cash flow, and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the applicable taxing authority which could increase our tax liabilities. Furthermore, companies in the payment processing industry, including us, may become subject to incremental taxation in various taxing jurisdictions. Taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. If we are required to pay additional taxes and are unable to pass the tax expense through to our customers, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and are therefore subject to the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and certain other increased disclosure and governance requirements.\nAs of January 1, 2021, we lost our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As a result, we are no longer able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements. Therefore, we are now subject to certain requirements that apply to other public companies that did not previously apply to us, due to our previous status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\ncompliance with any new rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022\ncompliance with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies without an extended transition period;\n\u2022\nfull disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFailure to comply with these requirements could subject us to enforcement actions by the SEC, divert management\u2019s attention, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In particular, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not able to render the required attestation, it could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of our financial reports. We expect that the loss of \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status and compliance with these additional requirements will require management to expend additional time while also condensing the time frame available to comply with certain requirements, which may further increase our legal and financial compliance costs.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control, we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. We continue to work to improve our internal controls. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, react to changes in the economy or our industry and to raise additional capital to fund operations.\nOn February 3, 2021, we replaced our existing senior secured credit facilities with a new $125.0 million revolving credit facility pursuant to amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d) with Truist Bank and certain other lenders. On January 19, 2021, we issued $440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d). Our ability to service our obligations under our indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes and any indebtedness we may incur under the Amended Credit Agreement, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.\nOur ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. and such level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders.\nWe may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nOur indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the 2021 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and\ntiming of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or reduction in our interest income\nFuture operating flexibility is limited by the restrictive covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement, and we may be unable to comply with all covenants in the future.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement imposes restrictions that could impede our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions, as well as increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and industry. These restrictions will limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments, dividends, distributions or investments; and\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict the incurrence of indebtedness unless certain incurrence-based financial covenant requirements are met. The restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interests of the business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants in future periods will largely depend on our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default, which could result in the acceleration of our debt. In the event of an acceleration of our indebtedness, we could be forced to apply all available cash flows to repay such debt, which would reduce or eliminate distributions to us, which could also force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2026 Notes, or to repurchase the 2026 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain, limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2026 Notes.\nHolders of the 2026 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their 2026 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, unless we elect to cause to be delivered solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2026 Notes surrendered therefor or to pay cash with respect to the 2026 Notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the 2026 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2026 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2026 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the 2026 Notes (the \u201cindenture\u201d) or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 Notes as required by the indenture, would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture, or the fundamental change itself, could also lead to a default under our Amended Credit Agreement and other agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase, make interest payments on or make cash payments upon conversion of the 2026 Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2026 Notes will be entitled to convert their 2026 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2026 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2026 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2026 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of shareholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2026 Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income (or larger net losses) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. In August 2020, FASB published an Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, which we refer to as ASU 2020-06, eliminating the separate accounting for the debt and equity components as described above. ASU 2020-06 will be effective for us for the fiscal year 2022, including interim periods within fiscal years. When effective, we expect the elimination of the separate accounting described above to reduce the interest expense that we expect to recognize for the 2026 Notes under current accounting principles.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the 2026 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2026 Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. ASU 2020-06 described above amends these accounting standards, effective as of the date referred to above, to instead require entities to apply the \u201cif-converted\u201d method under which diluted earnings per share are generally calculated assuming that all the 2026 Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may result in a reduction of our reported diluted earnings per share.\nProvisions in the indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of the Company\nCertain provisions of the 2026 Notes and the indenture could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then we will be required to make an offer to the holders of the 2026 Notes to repurchase for cash all or part of their outstanding 2026 Notes. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to increase the conversion rate temporarily. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2026 Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that you may view as favorable.\nRisks Related to Our Ownership Structure\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in Hawk Parent, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions made by our subsidiaries to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, meet our financial obligations under the 2026 Notes and pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than our ownership of limited liability company interests of Hawk Parent (the \u201cPost-Merger Repay Units\u201d and holders of such Post-Merger Repay Units other than the Company, the \u201cRepay Unitholders\u201d) and our managing member interest in Hawk Parent, and we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. Upon the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into that certain Tax Receivable Agreement (the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d or \u201cTRA\u201d) with the Repay Unitholders. Our ability to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, meet our financial obligations under the 2026 Notes and pay dividends will depend on the financial results and cash flows of Hawk Parent and its subsidiaries and the distributions we receive from Hawk Parent. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of Hawk Parent and its subsidiaries, including its operating subsidiaries, for any reason could limit or impair Hawk Parent\u2019s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and Hawk Parent and/or any of its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions\nunder applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or Hawk Parent is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nHawk Parent is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to Repay Unitholders (including us). Accordingly, we will be required to pay income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Hawk Parent. Under the terms of Hawk Parent\u2019s Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, Hawk Parent is obligated to make tax distributions to Repay Unitholders (including us) calculated at certain assumed tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement (and the cost of administering such payment obligations), which could be significant. We intend to cause Hawk Parent to make distributions to Repay Unitholders in amounts sufficient to cover all applicable taxes (calculated at assumed tax rates), relevant operating expenses, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by Hawk Parent. However, as discussed below, Hawk Parent\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which Hawk Parent is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Hawk Parent insolvent. If our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and to fund our obligations, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to provide the liquidity needed to make such payments, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAdditionally, although Hawk Parent generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax, it may be liable under recent federal tax legislation for adjustments to its tax return, absent an election to the contrary. In the event Hawk Parent\u2019s calculations of taxable income are incorrect, its members, including us, in later years may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this federal legislation and its related guidance.\nWe anticipate that the distributions we will receive from Hawk Parent may, in certain periods, exceed our actual tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our board of the directors, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, to acquire additional newly issued Post-Merger Repay Units from Hawk Parent at a per unit price determined by reference to the market value of the Class A common stock; to pay dividends, which may include special dividends, on our Class A common stock; to fund repurchases of Class A common stock; or any combination of the foregoing. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on Class A common stock or otherwise undertake ameliorative actions between Post-Merger Repay Units and shares of Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances, Repay Unitholders that hold interests in Hawk Parent pre-Business Combination may benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances as a result of their ownership of Class A common stock following an exchange of their Post-Merger Repay Units, notwithstanding that such holders may previously have participated as holders of Post-Merger Repay Units in distributions by Hawk Parent that resulted in such excess cash balances being held by us.\nDividends on our common stock, if any, will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors, which will consider, among other things, our business, operating results, financial condition, current and expected cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay such dividends. Financing arrangements may include restrictive covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders. In addition, Hawk Parent is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Hawk Parent (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Hawk Parent\u2019s subsidiaries are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to Hawk Parent. If Hawk Parent does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to pay 100% of the tax benefits relating to tax depreciation or amortization deductions as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with the exchanges (including an exchange in a sale for cash) of Post-Merger Repay Units into our Class A common stock and related transactions, and those payments may be substantial.\nThe Repay Unitholders may exchange their Post-Merger Repay Units for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, subject to certain conditions as set forth therein and in Hawk Parent\u2019s Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, or in an exchange in a sale for cash. These exchanges are expected to result in increases in our allocable share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Hawk Parent. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income or franchise tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future had such exchanges never occurred.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which generally provides for the payment to the Repay Unitholders by us of 100% of certain tax benefits, if any, that we realize (or in certain cases are deemed to realize) (a portion of which will be paid in turn to certain service providers on behalf of them in respect of certain transaction expenses) as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax attributes of Hawk Parent and tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. These payments are our obligation and not an obligation of Hawk Parent. The actual increase in our allocable share of Hawk Parent\u2019s tax basis in its assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of the recognition of our income. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that we will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement are outside of our control, we expect that the payments we will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any payments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may exceed the actual tax benefits we realize or be accelerated.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the Internal Revenue Service or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of the tax basis increases, as well as other tax positions that we take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event any tax benefits initially claimed by us are disallowed, the current Repay Unitholders will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to such holders will be netted against any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us, if any, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments from which to net against. As a result, in certain circumstances, we could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual income or franchise tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nMoreover, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the event that (i) we exercise our early termination rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) we become bankrupt or undergo a similar insolvency event, (iii) certain changes of control of us occur (as described in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or (iv) we are more than three months late in making of a payment due under the Tax Receivable Agreement (unless we in good faith determine that we have insufficient funds to make such payment), our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will accelerate and we will be required to make an immediate lump-sum cash payment to the Repay Unitholders equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. The lump-sum payment to the Repay Unitholders could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we realize subsequent to such payment because such payment would be calculated assuming, among other things, that we would be able to use the assumed potential tax benefits in future years, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination.\nThere may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual income or franchise tax savings that we realize. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. We may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. Such indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Class A Common Stock\nFuture issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such issuances or sales may occur, could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.\nHawk Parent has outstanding an aggregate of 7,959,160 Post-Merger Repay Units as of February 23, 2021. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Repay Unitholders have the right to elect to exchange such Post-Merger Repay Units into shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement. However, Hawk Parent may elect to settle such exchange in cash in lieu of delivering shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement.\nIn addition, we have reserved a total of 7,326,728 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under our Repay Holdings Corporation Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, the \u201cIncentive Plan.\u201d). Of these shares, 2,809,447 shares of Class A common stock remain available for future issuance under the Incentive Plan as of February 23, 2021. To the extent such shares have vested or vest in the future (and settle into shares, in the case of restricted stock units), they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nIf these stockholders exercise their sale or exchange rights and sell shares or are perceived by the market as intending to sell shares, the market price of our shares of Class A common stock could drop significantly. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through offerings of our shares of Class A common stock or other securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe also have outstanding $440.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes which are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock in certain circumstances. Investors will incur further dilution upon the conversion of any of our 2026 Notes if we elect to deliver shares of Class A common stock upon such conversion. In the future, we may also issue additional securities in connection with investments, acquisitions or capital raising activities, which could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and may result in additional dilution to investors or adversely impact the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could negatively affect our business and operations.\nHistorically, our Class A common stock has experienced substantial price volatility. For example, the closing price per share of our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market ranged from a low of $11.35 to a high of $27.90 during the period from January 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020. This volatility could be the result of changes in our volumes, revenue, earnings and margins or general market and economic factors. If our future operating results or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors, our stock price will likely decline.\nSpeculation and opinions in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations or significant transactions can also cause changes in our stock price. In particular, speculation on our go-forward strategy, competition in some of the markets we address and the effect of COVID-19 on our business, may have a dramatic effect on our stock price.\nVolatility in the stock price of our common stock or other reasons may in the future cause us to become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and board of directors\u2019 attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist shareholder matters.\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay dividends, holders of our Class A common stock will benefit from an investment in our Class A common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our Class A common stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our Class A common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nDelaware law and our governing documents contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions regarding:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that directors may only be removed from the board of directors for cause;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent (except in limited circumstances), which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of our board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of the holders of a supermajority of our voting stock to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of our bylaws and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, respectively, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are generally subject to provisions of Delaware law, including the DGCL. Although we have elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, in a manner substantially similar to Section 203 of the DGCL, prohibit certain of our stockholders (other than those stockholders who are party to a stockholders\u2019 agreement with us) who hold 15% or more of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combination transactions with us for a specified period of time unless certain conditions are met.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court located in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or our officers or directors arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us or our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find these exclusive-forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17976, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "RPAY"}
