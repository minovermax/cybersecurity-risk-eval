{"cik": "944508", "company": "INVENTURE FOODS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our Common Stock. You should read and carefully consider these risk factors, and the entirety of this Form 10-K, before you invest in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. On November 18, 2015, we entered into (i) a five-year $50.0 million revolving credit facility (with all related loan documents, and as amended from time to time, the \u201cABL Credit Facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as the administrative agent, and the other lenders party\nthereto, and (ii) a five-year $85.0 million term loan facility (with all related loan documents, and as amended from time to time, the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Facility\u201d), with BSP Agency, LLC (\u201cBSP), as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which facilities replaced our prior credit agreement with U.S. Bank National Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d) dated November 8, 2013 (with all related loan documents, and as amended from time to time, the \u201cPrior Credit Facility\u201d). The ABL Credit Facility and the Term Loan Credit Facility are collectively referred to in this Form 10-K as the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d and individually as a \u201cCredit Facility.\u201d\nUnder the terms of the Term Loan Credit Facility, we are required to comply with leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and a minimum EBITDA target by the fiscal month ending April 30, 2017 (the \u201cMinimum EBITDA Covenant\u201d). Absent a waiver from our Term Loan Credit Facility lenders or an amendment deferring compliance with the Minimum EBITDA Covenant, we will not be in compliance with this covenant at April 30, 2017. Further, absent the completion by the end of our second fiscal quarter of a transaction yielding sufficient cash proceeds to pay down or refinance the Term Loan Credit Facility, or the receipt of a waiver from the lenders thereunder or a further amendment to the Term Loan Credit Facility, we will not be able to comply with the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants.\nFurther, under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility, we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio if our liquidity as of the date of any determination is less than the greater of (i) 12.5% of the Maximum Revolver Amount ($50,000,000) and (ii) $6,125,000, subject to certain conditions. As of March 31, 2017, we would not be able to comply with this ratio if our liquidity were to fall below the applicable threshold. Should the lenders under our Credit Facilities demand immediate repayment of all of our obligations, we will likely be unable to pay such obligations. In such event, we may have to recapitalize, refinance, raise additional liquidity by selling some or all of our assets or seek to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\nOur Credit Facilities also require us to furnish our audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d uncertainty paragraph in the auditor\u2019s opinion. Our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 included herein contain a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph. We have obtained a temporary waiver of the going concern qualification until May 15, 2017 from each of the lenders under our Credit Facilities. Absent the completion by May 15, 2017 of a transaction yielding sufficient cash proceeds to pay down or refinance our debt, or receipt of further waivers from our lenders, we will be in default of the Credit Facilities as a result of the expiration of the temporary going concern waivers.\nFailure to meet any financial covenant under the Credit Facilities or the existence of a going concern opinion that has not been waived by our lenders would result in an event of default thereunder and, to the extent the applicable lenders so elect, an acceleration of the Company\u2019s existing indebtedness, causing such debt of approximately $122.1 million at December 31, 2016 (including $5.2 million of other equipment financing indebtedness that includes cross-default provisions) to be immediately due and payable. In such event, our lenders could foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt. The Company does not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of its outstanding debt in full if such debt were accelerated. It could also result in the termination of all commitments to extend further credit under our ABL Credit Facility. Should the lenders under our Credit Facilities accelerate our debt and demand immediate repayment of all of our obligations, we may have to seek to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. These events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also \u201cRisks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Economy and the Credit Markets.\u201d\nIn the future, it may be necessary for the Company to seek bankruptcy protection, which may harm our business, impact our creditors and place our equity holders at significant risk of losing some or all of their interests in our business.\nIf we are not able to timely complete a strategic transaction or obtain additional waivers from our lenders under the Credit Facilities or a further amendment thereto to defer compliance with our financial covenant requirements, we may seek protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Seeking bankruptcy protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as a proceeding related to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is ongoing, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of\ntime and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer a proceeding related to a bankruptcy continues, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers would lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and would seek to establish alternative commercial relationships or request financial assurances such as letters of credit and cash deposits.\nIt is not possible to predict the outcome of any bankruptcy proceeding that may be required. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, there can be no assurance that we would be able to restructure as a going concern or successfully propose or implement a plan of reorganization that provides for the continuation of the business post-bankruptcy. Moreover, we have a significant amount of secured indebtedness that is senior to our existing common shares. As a result, we believe that if we are subject to a bankruptcy court proceeding, it is likely that holders of claims and interests with respect to our equity securities would be entitled to little or no recovery, and those claims and interests would likely be canceled for little or no consideration.\nMaterial weaknesses can exist in our system of internal control over financial reporting, which could have a material impact on our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process. We expect that we will need to improve existing operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and implement new ones, to manage our future business effectively.\nFurthermore, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) . In connection with preparing this Form 10-K, we determined that we had a material weakness, as of December 31, 2016, in our controls over accounting for and reporting of our trade spend liabilities.\nAs a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as set forth above, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. Until the evaluation and review of this material weakness is fully remediated, our ability to report results accurately and on time could be impaired.\nAny failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any such failure could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, or cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe may incur losses and costs as a result of any product recalls we are required to make or product liability claims that may be brought against us.\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. We may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury. Such injury could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties; product contamination (such as listeria, e-coli, and salmonella) or spoilage; the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, and other agents; residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases; or improperly formulated products. A widespread product recall could result in significant and unexpected expenditures and losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. The product liability and product recall insurance maintained by us may not be adequate to cover any loss or exposure for product liability, and such insurance may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. Any product liability claim not fully covered by insurance, as well as any adverse publicity resulting from a product liability claim or product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, and could also result in\nadverse publicity, damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products. In addition, our results could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products, ingredients or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case.\nConcerns with the safety and quality of our food products or ingredients could negatively impact our brand image and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products or ingredients. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation. We cannot assure you, however, that our commitment to product safety and quality and our continuing investment in advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products\u2019 brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Allegations of product safety or quality issues or contamination, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a product from all of the markets in which the affected production was distributed. Such issues or recalls could negatively affect our profitability and brand image.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from one customer.\nOverall, Costco accounted for approximately 19% of our 2016 net revenues. A decision by Costco to no longer carry certain frozen berry products could have a material adverse impact on our Frozen business. A decision by any major customer to cease or substantially reduce its purchases, or a decrease in the popularity of frozen berries during any year, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, and such decision by Costco would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a license agreement for the right to sell our T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae and Jamba\u00ae brands.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 11.5% of our net revenues were attributable to the T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae brand products, which are manufactured and sold by us under our license agreement with T.G.I. Friday\u2019s that expires in December 2019, subject to one five year renewal period. The license agreement imposes certain requirements and conditions on us (including, without limitation, minimum sales targets). Our failure to comply with these requirements and conditions could result in the early termination of this license agreement by T.G.I. Friday\u2019s. If we are unsuccessful in negotiating an extension of this license agreement, or the license agreement is not renewed at the expiration of its term or is terminated prior thereto, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 4.4% of our net revenues were attributable to the Jamba\u00ae brand products, which are manufactured and sold by us under our license agreement with Jamba Juice Company that expires in 2035. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are required to make royalty payments on sales of Jamba\u00ae products and are required to achieve certain minimum sales levels by certain dates during the contract term. Our failure to comply with these requirements and conditions could result in the early termination of this license agreement by Jamba Juice Company. If this license is terminated early, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by oversupply of snack and frozen products at the wholesale and retail levels.\nProfitability in the food product industry is subject to oversupply of certain snack and frozen products at the wholesale and retail levels, which can result in our products going out of date before they are sold.\nWe may incur substantial costs in order to market our products.\nSuccessful marketing of our products generally depends upon obtaining adequate retail shelf space for product display, particularly in grocery stores. Frequently, food manufacturers and distributors, incur costs in order to obtain additional shelf space. Whether or not we incur such costs in a particular market is dependent upon a number of factors, including demand for our products, relative availability of shelf space and general competitive conditions. We may incur significant shelf space or other promotional costs as a necessary condition of entering into competition or maintaining market share in particular markets or stores. If incurred, such costs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to respond successfully to shifting consumer preferences.\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and are extremely difficult to predict. Our success depends in part on our ability to timely respond to current market trends and anticipate changing consumer tastes and dietary habits and to develop and license new products that appeal to such preferences, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by increased attention to nutritional values, such as the sodium, fat, protein, or calorie content of different products, or concerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients, such as gluten, soybeans, nuts, and oils. If consumer demand for our products declines, our sales volumes and our business could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including for management, sales, and order processing. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the sales and delivery of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. Like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of cyber-attack or computer hacking, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or our customers. This could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, or the improper use of personal information or other \u201cidentity theft.\u201d Each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and results.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. The Company\u2019s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company\u2019s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company\u2019s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, health and safety practices, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are made, manufactured or sold. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices; laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products; laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients present in certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving, product claims and concerns regarding the effects on health of ingredients in, or attributes of, certain of our products; state consumer protection laws; taxation requirements, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products; competition laws; anti-corruption laws; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; and environmental laws. New laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products, ingredients contained in our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may impact our operating results or increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe may incur significant future expenses in connection with the implementation of our business strategy.\nWe strive to achieve our long-term vision of being a leading marketer and manufacturer of healthy/natural and indulgent specialty snack food brands. Our efforts are subject to the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the implementation of a business strategy. If we are unsuccessful in developing, acquiring and/or licensing new brands, and increasing distribution and sales volume of our existing products, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Even if we are successful, this business strategy may require us to incur substantial additional expenses, including advertising and promotional costs, \u201cslotting\u201d expenses (i.e., the cost of obtaining shelf or freezer space in certain grocery stores), and integration costs of any future acquisitions. We also may be unsuccessful at integrating any future acquisitions.\nWe may not be successful in our future acquisition or other strategic transaction endeavors, if any, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA material element of our business strategy is the development, acquisition and/or licensing of innovative specialty food brands, for the purpose of expanding, complementing and/or diversifying our business. We may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions, such as joint ventures or investments in other entities to facilitate this business strategy. We may be unable to identify suitable targets, opportunistic or otherwise, for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future. If we identify a suitable candidate, our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements. If we need to obtain our lenders\u2019 consent to a strategic transaction, they may refuse to provide such consent or condition their consent on our compliance with additional restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. Strategic transactions involve risks, including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate (as applicable), financial reporting, disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies, joint ventures or related companies; managing geographically dispersed operations, joint ventures or other strategic investments; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies, joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments. We may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions. Strategic transactions may be expensive, time consuming and may strain our resources. Strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, one-time write-offs\nof goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets. In addition, strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Economy and the Credit Markets\nWe are required to comply with certain ongoing financial and other covenants under our Credit Facilities, and if we fail to meet those covenants or otherwise suffer a default thereunder, our lenders may accelerate the payment of such indebtedness.\nOn November 18, 2015, we entered into the ABL Credit Facility and the Term Loan Credit Facility, which facilities replaced our Prior Credit Facility. Our obligations under the ABL Credit Facility and the Term Loan Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by our subsidiaries. We are required to comply with certain financial and other restrictive covenants pursuant to these two Credit Facilities so long as borrowings remain outstanding thereunder.\nAbsent the completion of a transaction yielding sufficient cash proceeds to pay down or refinance our debt, or receipt of waivers from our lenders or a further amendment to the Term Loan Credit Facility , we will not be able to comply with the financial covenants under our Credit Facilities when required to do so. Failure to meet these covenants would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the applicable Credit Facility ) and, to the extent the applicable lenders so elect, an acceleration of the Company\u2019s existing indebtedness following the expiration of any applicable cure periods, causing such debt of approximately $122.1 million at December 31, 2016 (including $32.8 million under our ABL Credit Facility and $5.2 million of equipment lease financing indebtedness with cross-default provisions) to be immediately due and payable. It could also result in the termination of all commitments to extend further credit under our ABL Credit Facility. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of its outstanding debt in full if such debt were accelerated. In such event, our lenders could foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt. These events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d If we are not able to timely, successfully or efficiently implement one or more of the strategic transactions that we are pursuing, we may need to seek voluntary protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are capital intensive, and we operate with a high amount of debt relative to our size. At December 31, 2016, we had (i) $32.8 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our ABL Credit Facility, and (ii) $84.2 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our Term Loan Credit Facility. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to sell assets to reduce indebtedness or influence our decisions about whether to do so;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our business due to debt service requirements;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other cash requirements;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our operational flexibility due to the covenants contained in our debt agreements;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to compete with companies that are less leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u00b7\nmaking us vulnerable to fluctuations in market interest rates, to the extent our debt is subject to floating interest rates or needs to be refinanced;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nCovenants in our debt instruments restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions.\nThe Credit Facilities require us, under certain limited circumstances, to maintain certain financial ratios and limit our ability to make capital expenditures. As discussed above under the risk factor \u201cThere is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d our Term Loan Credit Facility and related governing documents require us to comply with leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and a minimum EBITDA target by the fiscal month ending April 30, 2017. Under our ABL Credit Facility we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio if our liquidity as of the date of any determination is less than the greater of (i) 12.5% of the Maximum Revolver Amount ($50,000,000) and (ii) $6,125,000, subject to certain conditions. These covenants and ratios could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. Moreover, absent the completion of a transaction yielding sufficient cash proceeds to pay down or refinance our debt, or receipt of waivers from our lenders or a further amendment to our Term Loan Credit Facility, we will not be able to comply with the covenants under our Term Loan Credit Facility. Breach of a covenant in the Credit Facilities could cause acceleration of a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness. Any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those imposed under the Credit Facilities.\nA breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and, due to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, could result in a default under our other debt instruments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the ABL Credit Facility, Term Loan Credit Facility or any other debt instrument, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of the ABL Credit Facility, terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under our current or future indebtedness accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe amount we can borrow under our ABL Credit Facility depends in part on the value of certain pledged collateral. If the value of such collateral declines under appraisals our lenders receive, the amount we can borrow will similarly decline. If the amount we can borrow declines as a result of the foregoing, we may be required to repay certain outstanding borrowings in order to remain in compliance with the covenants under the ABL Credit Facility. In such event, we cannot assure you our cash flow would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations under our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance and that of our subsidiaries, which, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial and business factors, many of which may be beyond our control. See the table under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations\u201d for disclosure regarding the amount of cash required to service our debt.\nWe may not maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our debt. Such alternative measures may not be successful and may not enable us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our anticipated high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our debt, as well as prevailing market conditions. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations\nto meet our debt service and other obligations. The instruments governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those sales, or if we do, at an opportune time, or the proceeds that we realize may not be adequate to meet debt service obligations when due.\nGlobal capital and credit market conditions could have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital and credit markets, including our revolving credit facility.\nDisruptions in the global credit markets that materially impact liquidity in the debt market, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive or, in some cases, unavailable altogether, have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future. Such a disruption could result in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing, including access to revolving lines of credit. We engage in borrowing and repayment activities under our revolving credit facility on an almost daily basis and have not had any disruption in our ability to access our revolving credit facility as needed. However, future credit market conditions could increase the likelihood that one or more of our lenders may be unable to honor its commitments under our revolving credit facility, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in the future we may need to raise additional funds to, among other things, fund our existing operations, improve or expand our operations, respond to competitive pressures, or make acquisitions. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests, and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the Common Stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations arising out of the agreements governing such debt. If we fail to raise capital when needed, our business will be negatively affected.\nOur business is subject to the general health of the economy, including consumer spending, and any slowdowns or decreases in the U.S. economy could materially affect our revenue and operating results.\nAn economic slowdown in the U.S., including consumer spending, may cause substantial volatility in the stock market and layoffs and other restrictions on spending by companies in almost every business sector could impact our business in a variety of ways, including:\n\u00b7\na reduction in consumer spending, which would result in a reduction in demand for our products or result in increased pressure from competitors or customers to reduce the prices of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.;\n\u00b7\na negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us or our vendors to timely supply services, thus reducing our cash flow; and\n\u00b7\nan increase in payment risk with others we do business with, including customers, suppliers, distributors, financial institutions, insurance companies and other business partners, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nWithout similar changes in expenses, which may be difficult to achieve, our margins will contract if revenue falls, and ultimately may result in having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Frozen Products Segment\nFarming is subject to numerous inherent risks, including changes in weather conditions and natural disasters, that can have an adverse impact on crop production and materially affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks that generally relate to the agricultural industry. Adverse changes in weather conditions and natural disasters, such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, droughts, extreme temperatures or pestilence, may affect the crop quality and size. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fresh berries and vegetables are also vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. These infestations can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our competitors may be affected differently by such weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations.\nUnavailability of purchased berries and vegetables, at reasonable prices, could adversely affect operations.\nOur manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in certain commodity prices. Berries and vegetables are not readily available year-round. Therefore, we use the IQF technique to freeze the berries and vegetables harvested for use during the year to meet processing demands. In addition to freezing our own home-grown berries, we also purchase a substantial amount of berries from outside suppliers to meet customer demands. We are dependent on our suppliers to provide us with an adequate supply of vegetables and berries on a timely basis. The failure of certain suppliers to meet our performance specifications, quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. To the extent that certain types of berries or vegetables become scarce, substantially increase in price, or become unavailable or unavailable on commercially attractive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Snack Product Segment\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive snack food industry.\nThe market for snack foods, such as those sold by us, is large and intensely competitive. Competitive factors in the snack food industry include product quality and taste, brand awareness among consumers, access to grocery store shelf space, price, advertising and promotion, variety of snacks offered, nutritional content, product packaging and package design. We compete in that market principally on the basis of product taste and quality.\nThe snack food industry is dominated by large food companies, including Frito-Lay, Inc., a subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc., The Kellogg Company, ConAgra Foods, Inc., Diamond Foods, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Snyder\u2019s-Lance, Inc. and others which have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and sell brands that are more widely recognized than our products. Numerous other companies that are actual or potential competitors of ours, many with greater financial and other resources (including more employees and more extensive facilities) than us, offer products similar to ours. In addition, many of our competitors offer a wider range of products than that offered by us. Local or regional markets often have a significant number of smaller competitors, many of whom offer products similar to ours. With the expansion of our operations into new markets, we have and will continue to encounter significant competition from national, regional and local competitors that may be greater than that encountered by us in our existing markets. In addition, such competitors may challenge our position in our existing markets.\nA disruption in the performance of our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in the prices of potatoes, potato flakes, potato starch, corn and oil, as well as other ingredients used in our products. Potatoes, potato flakes, potato starch and corn are widely available year-round, and we use a variety of oils in the production of our products. Nonetheless, we are dependent on our suppliers to provide us with products and ingredients in adequate supply and on a timely basis. The failure of certain suppliers to meet our performance specifications, quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers\u2019 financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. Any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance. To the extent that product ingredients become scarce, substantially increase in price, or become unavailable or unavailable on commercially attractive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. From time to time, we may lock in prices for raw\nmaterials, such as oils, as we deem appropriate, and such strategies may result in us paying prices for raw materials that are above market at the time of purchase.\nWe do not own the patents for the technology we use to manufacture certain T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae, Boulder Canyon\u00ae and Tato Skins\u00ae brand products, as well as certain private label branded products.\nWe license technology from a third party in connection with the manufacture of certain T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae, Boulder Canyon\u00ae and Tato Skins\u00ae brand products, as well as certain private label branded products, and have a royalty-bearing, exclusive right license to use the technology necessary to produce these products in the United States, Canada, and Mexico until such time as the parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement. Even though the patents for this technology expired in December 2006, in consideration for the use of this technology, we are required to make royalty payments to the third party on sales of products manufactured utilizing the technology until the termination of such license agreement. Since these patents have expired, we no longer have exclusive rights to this technology and, as a result, may face additional competition that could adversely affect our revenues. Moreover, our competitors, some of which may have significantly greater resources than us, may utilize different technology in the manufacture of products that are similar to those we currently manufacture, or that we may manufacture in the future. The entry of any such products into the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on our sales of certain T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae, Boulder Canyon\u00ae and Tato Skins\u00ae brand products, certain private label branded products, as well as any such future products.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to protect our rights to trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property we own or license. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our services or our use of intellectual property infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement against us could prevent us from providing services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a breakdown in our internal policies and procedures may lead to an unintentional disclosure of our proprietary, confidential or material non-public information, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur shares of common stock would likely be delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market following a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\nNASDAQ rules provide that securities of a company that trades on NASDAQ may be delisted in the event that such company seeks bankruptcy protection. In response to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by us, NASDAQ would likely issue a delisting letter immediately following such a filing. If NASDAQ issued such a letter, our common stock would soon thereafter be delisted and there would be a very limited market or no market at all, in which its securities would be traded.\nSubstantial sales of our Common Stock by our stockholders could depress the market price of our Common Stock regardless of our operating results.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and impair our ability to raise capital through offerings of our Common Stock. All of our outstanding shares are either freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market or eligible for sale in the public market at various times, subject, in some cases, to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Substantial sales of our Common Stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-linked\nsecurities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Common Stock.\nOur stock price has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, and may decline regardless of our financial performance.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements relating to our industry or to our own business or prospects;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other public companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the global economy;\n\u00b7\nour ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of Common Stock or the perception that sales could occur;\n\u00b7\nfailure of suppliers to meet expectations;\n\u00b7\nthe unavailability of berries or vegetables at attractive prices;\n\u00b7\nany major change in our Board or management;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments relating to litigation, governmental investigation, the legal and regulatory environment, product recalls or changes in competitive conditions; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, changes in weather conditions or natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company. If securities class action litigation is instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, preventing or rendering more difficult an acquisition of us if such acquisition is\ndeemed undesirable by our Board. Among other things, our amended certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our Common Stock;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings; and\n\u00b7\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board and stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding Common Stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of our Board and the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding Common Stock not held by such 15% or greater stockholder.\nAny provision of our amended certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, or if our operating or financial results do not meet expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets. In addition, if our operating or financial results do not meet analysts\u2019 expectations, our stock price or trading volume could decline. Any of these factors could cause you to lose part or all of you investment in our Common Stock.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain debt agreements of ours limit our ability to declare and pay cash dividends, and any future financing agreements may prohibit us from paying any type of dividends. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 84325, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "SNAK"}
