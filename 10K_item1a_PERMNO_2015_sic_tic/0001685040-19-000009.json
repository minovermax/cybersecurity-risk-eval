Risk Factors\nIndex to Risk Factors\nPage\nOverview\nRisks Related to Our Business\nEconomic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks\nInvestments-Related Risks\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nCapital-Related Risks\nOperational Risks\nGeneral Risks\nRisks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOverview\nYou should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors are important to understanding the contents of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other reports. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe materialization of any risks and uncertainties set forth below or identified in \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC or those that are presently unforeseen or that we currently believe to be immaterial could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDifferences between actual experience and actuarial assumptions and the effectiveness of our actuarial models may adversely affect our financial results, capitalization and financial condition\nOur earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our actual claims experience and benefit payments on our products are consistent with the assumptions we use in setting prices for our products and establishing liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Such amounts are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. To the extent that actual claims and benefits experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in establishing such liabilities, we could be required to increase our liabilities. We make assumptions regarding policyholder behavior at the time of pricing and in selecting and utilizing the guaranteed options inherent within our products based in part upon expected persistency of the products, which change the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Persistency within our annuities business may be significantly affected by the value of GMxBs contained in many of our variable annuities being higher than current account values in light of poor equity market performance or extended periods of low interest rates, as well as other factors. Persistency could be adversely affected generally by developments affecting policyholder perception of us, including perceptions arising from adverse publicity. The pricing of certain of our variable annuity products that contain certain living benefit guarantees is also based on assumptions about utilization rates, or the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration, including the timing of the first lifetime income withdrawal. Results may vary based on differences between actual and expected benefit utilization. A material increase in the valuation of the liability could result to the extent emerging and actual experience deviates from these policyholder option utilization assumptions, and in certain circumstances this deviation may impair our solvency.\nWe use actuarial models to assist us in establishing reserves for liabilities arising from our insurance policies and annuity contracts. We periodically review the effectiveness of these models, their underlying logic and assumptions and, from time to time, implement refinements to our models based on these reviews. We only implement refinements after rigorous testing and validation and, even after such validation and testing our models remain subject to inherent limitations. Accordingly, no assurances\ncan be given as to whether or when we will implement refinements to our actuarial models, and, if implemented, the extent of such refinements. Furthermore, if implemented, any such refinements could cause us to increase the reserves we hold for our insurance policy and annuity contract liabilities which would adversely affect our RBC ratio and the amount of Variable Annuity Assets we hold in excess of our Variable Annuity Target Funding Level and, in the case of any material model refinements, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities. Such amounts may vary materially from the estimated amounts, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on accounting requirements, which change from time to time, the assumptions and models used to establish the liabilities, as well as our actual experience. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments and claims prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such increases would adversely affect our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including our capitalization and our ability to receive statutory dividends from our operating insurance companies, as well as a material adverse effect on the financial strength ratings which are necessary to support our product sales. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities.\u201d\nGuarantees within certain of our products may decrease our earnings, decrease our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk and counterparty risk\nCertain of the variable annuity products we offer include guaranteed benefits, including GMDBs, GMWBs and GMABs. While we continue to have GMIBs in force with respect to which we are obligated to perform, we no longer offer GMIBs. We also offer index-linked annuities with guarantees against a defined floor on losses. These guarantees are designed to protect contract holders against significant changes in equity markets and interest rates. Any such periods of significant and sustained negative or low separate account returns, increased equity volatility, or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of our liabilities associated with variable annuity products. In addition, if the separate account assets consisting of fixed income securities, which support the guaranteed index-linked return feature are insufficient to reflect a period of sustained growth in the equity-index on which the product is based, we may be required to support such separate accounts with assets from our general account and increase our liabilities. An increase in these liabilities would result in a decrease in our net income and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, including our capitalization and our ability to receive statutory dividends from our operating insurance companies, as well as the financial strength ratings which are necessary to support our product sales. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Annual Actuarial Review.\u201d\nAdditionally, we make assumptions regarding policyholder behavior at the time of pricing and in selecting and utilizing the guaranteed options inherent within our products (e.g., utilization of option to annuitize within a GMIB product). An increase in the valuation of the liability could result to the extent emerging and actual experience deviates from these policyholder option utilization assumptions. On an annual basis we review key actuarial assumptions used to record our variable annuity liabilities, including those assumptions regarding policyholder behavior. Changes to assumptions based on our annual actuarial review (the \u201cAAR\u201d) in future years could result in an increase in the liabilities we record for future policy benefits and claims to a level that may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition which, in certain circumstances, could impair our solvency. See \u201cBusiness - Risk Management Strategies\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Annual Actuarial Review.\u201d\nWe also use hedging and other risk management strategies to mitigate the liability exposure primarily related to capital market risks. These strategies involve the use of reinsurance and derivatives, which may not be completely effective. For example, in the event that reinsurers, derivative counterparties or central clearinghouses are unable or unwilling to pay, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits. See \u201c- Our variable annuity exposure management strategy may not be effective, may result in net income volatility and may negatively affect our statutory capital.\u201d\nIn addition, capital markets hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. Furthermore, we are subject to the risk that changes in policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, could produce economic losses not addressed by the risk management techniques employed. These, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including net income, capitalization, financial condition or liquidity including our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries. See \u201cBusiness - Segments and Corporate & Other - Annuities - Current Products - Variable Annuities\u201d for further consideration of the risks associated with guaranteed benefits.\nOur variable annuity exposure management strategy may not be effective, may result in net income volatility and may negatively affect our statutory capital\nThe principal focus of our exposure risk management program is to maintain assets supporting our variable annuity contract guarantees at the Variable Annuity Target Funding Level.\nWe aim to hold assets supporting our variable annuity contracts at our Variable Annuity Target Funding Level to sustain asset adequacy during modest market downturns without the use of derivative instruments and, accordingly, reduce the need for hedging the daily or weekly fluctuations from small movements in capital markets. We focus our hedging activities primarily on mitigating the risk from larger movements in capital markets, which may deplete contract holder account values and may increase long-term guarantee claims. We also use longer dated derivative instruments. However, our hedging strategy may not be fully effective. In connection with our exposure risk management program we may determine to seek the approval of applicable regulatory authorities to permit us to increase our hedge limits consistent with those contemplated by the program. No assurance can be given that the approvals we request, if any, will be obtained and whether any such approvals would be subject to qualifications, limitations or conditions. In addition, the hedging instruments we enter into may not effectively offset the costs of variable annuity contract guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. If our capital is depleted in the event of persistent market downturns, we may need to replenish it by holding additional capital, which we may have allocated for other uses, or purchasing additional hedging protection through the use of more expensive derivatives with strike levels at the current market level. Under our hedging strategy, changes from period to period in the valuation of our policyholder benefits and claims and net derivative gains (losses) may result in more significant volatility, which in certain circumstances could be material, to our results of operations and financial condition under GAAP and our statutory capital levels than has been the case historically.\nIn addition, estimates and assumptions we make in connection with hedging activities may fail to reflect or correspond to our actual long-term exposure in respect of our guarantees. Further, the risk of increases in the costs of our guarantees not covered by our hedging and other capital and risk management strategies may become more significant due to changes in policyholder behavior driven by market conditions or other factors. The use of assets and derivative instruments may not effectively mitigate the effect of changes in policyholder behavior.\nFinally, the cost of our hedging program may be greater than anticipated because adverse market conditions can limit the availability and increase the costs of the derivatives we intend to employ, and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products we offer. The above factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capitalization and liquidity. See \u201c- Guarantees within certain of our products may decrease our earnings, decrease our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk and counterparty risk.\u201d See also \u201cBusiness - Risk Management Strategies\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Annual Actuarial Review.\u201d\nOur ULSG asset requirement target may not ensure we have sufficient assets to meet our future ULSG policyholder obligations and may result in net income volatility\nWe actively manage the market risk sensitivity related to our in-force ULSG exposure specifically to adapt to changes in interest rates.\nWe have utilized our ULSG CFT modeling approach as the basis for setting our ULSG asset requirement target for our affiliated reinsurance companies. For the business that remains in the operating companies, we set our ULSG asset requirement target to equal the actuarially determined statutory reserves under stressed conditions, which, taken together with our ULSG asset requirement target of our affiliated reinsurers, comprises our total ULSG Target. Under this approach we assume that interest rates remain flat or decline as compared to current levels and our actuarial assumptions include a provision for adverse deviation.\nWe seek to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk associated with these liabilities by maintaining ULSG Assets at or in excess of our ULSG Target in different interest rate environments.\nOur ULSG Target is sensitive to the actual and future expected level of long-term U.S. interest rates. If interest rates fall, our ULSG Target increases, and if interest rates rise, our ULSG Target declines. We primarily use interest rate swaps, swaptions and other derivatives to better protect statutory capitalization from potential losses due to an increase in reserves to achieve our ULSG Target in lower interest rate environments. We have implemented a dedicated interest rate risk mitigation program for our ULSG business. This risk mitigation strategy may negatively impact our GAAP equity and net income in circumstances in which interest rates are rising. Under rising interest rates, our ULSG Target will likely decline, whereas our reported ULSG GAAP liabilities are predominately insensitive to market conditions.\nThis risk mitigation strategy will likely result in higher net income volatility due to the insensitivity of GAAP liabilities to changes in interest rates. Our interest rate derivative instruments may not effectively offset the costs of our ULSG policyholder obligations or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our objectives. In addition, the assumptions we make in connection with our risk mitigation strategy may fail to reflect or correspond to actual long-term exposure to our ULSG policyholder obligations. If our liquid investments are depleted we will need to replenish our liquid portfolio by selling higher-yielding less liquid assets, which we may have allocated for other uses. The above factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capitalization or liquidity. See \u201cBusiness - Risk Management Strategies - ULSG Market Risk Exposure Management.\u201d\nOur analyses of scenarios and sensitivities utilized in connection with our variable annuity risk management strategies involve significant estimates based on assumptions that may result in material differences from actual outcomes compared to the sensitivities calculated under such scenarios\nAs part of our variable annuity exposure risk management program, we estimate the impact of various market factors under certain scenarios on the estimated CTE reserves and corresponding assets supporting our variable annuity contracts (collectively, the \u201cAnalyses\u201d). See \u201cBusiness - Risk Management Strategies.\u201d\nThe Analyses use inputs which are difficult to approximate and include estimates that may differ materially from actual results. Such estimates, or the absence thereof, are primarily associated with: (i) basis returns related to equity or fixed income indices; (ii) actuarial assumptions related to policyholder behavior and life expectancy; and (iii) management actions that may occur in response to developing facts, circumstances and experience for which no estimates are made in the Analyses. Such estimates, or the absence thereof, may produce sensitivities that differ materially from actual outcomes and may therefore affect actions we take in connection with our exposure risk management program.\nIn addition, the Analyses do not factor in the possibility of simultaneous shocks to equity markets, interest rates and market volatility. The actual effect of changes in equity markets and interest rates on the assets supporting our variable annuity contracts may vary depending on a number of factors which include, but are not limited to: (i) the validity of the Analyses only as of the measurement date; and (ii) changes in our hedging program, policyholder behavior and underlying fund performance, which could materially affect the liabilities our assets support. Furthermore, the Analyses illustrate the estimated impact of the indicated shocks occurring instantaneously, and therefore give no effect to rebalancing over the course of the shock event. The estimates of equity market shocks reflect a shock of the same magnitude to both domestic and global equity markets, while the estimates of interest rate shocks reflect a shock to rates at all durations (a parallel shift in the yield curve). Such instantaneous and/or equilateral impact assumptions may result in estimated sensitivities that differ materially from the actual impacts.\nAlthough the NAIC has promulgated guidelines on the total amount of assets required to support statutory reserves and capital relating to variable annuities, neither the NAIC nor any state insurance department currently specifies the particular set of stochastic capital market scenarios that an insurance company must use in its CTE calculation or whether such scenarios can be changed, or need be held constant going forward. Therefore, each insurance company runs scenarios which it believes are appropriate to it at a particular time, and the applicable CTE measure of one company may be materially different from the applicable CTE measure of another company. The NAIC is currently considering modifying its prescribed methodologies and assumptions and there can be no assurance that it will implement these modifications or that it will not implement different modifications in the future, any of which may have a material impact on our statutory capitalization and our variable annuity hedging strategy, as well as our implementation and timing thereof. As such, estimates used in the Analyses could materially differ from actual results depending on how such methodologies and assumptions may change under NAIC guidelines.\nFinally, no assurances can be given that the assumptions underlying our scenarios can or will be realized. In addition, our liquidity, statutory capitalization, results of operations and financial condition may be affected by a broad range of capital market scenarios, which, depending on whether they positively or adversely affect account values, could materially positively or adversely affect our reserving requirements under AG 43, and by extension, could materially affect the accuracy of estimates used in the Analyses, upon which the results of our risk management exposure program relies.\nA sustained period of low equity market prices and interest rates that are lower than those we assumed when we issued our variable annuity products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capitalization and financial condition\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for GMDBs and GMLBs under our variable annuity contracts are based on the value of the benefits we expect to be payable under such contracts in excess of the contract holders\u2019 projected account balances. We determine the fees we charge for providing these guarantees in substantial part on the basis of assumptions we make with respect to the growth of the account values relating to these contracts, including assumptions with respect to investment performance. If the actual growth in account values differs from our initial assumptions we may need to increase or decrease the amount of future benefit liabilities we record to the extent that other factors we consider in estimating the expected value of benefits payable,\nincluding policyholder behavior, do not offset the impact of changes in our assumptions with respect to investment performance. Although extreme declines or shocks in equity markets and interest rates can increase the level of reserves we need to hold to fund guarantees, other types of economic scenarios can also impact the adequacy of our reserves. For example, certain scenarios involving sustained stagnation in equity markets and low interest rates would adversely affect growth in account values and could require us to materially increase our benefit liabilities. As a result, in the absence of incremental management actions and not taking into account the effects of new business, our ability to retain the ratings necessary to market and sell our products, as well as our ability to repay or refinance indebtedness for borrowed money, could be materially adversely affected and our solvency could be impaired.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may adversely affect our financial statements\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), a recognized authoritative body. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or interpretations issued by the FASB. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented are disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nThe FASB issued an accounting standards update (\u201cASU\u201d) on August 15, 2018 that will result in significant changes to the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts, including that all of our variable annuity guarantees will be considered market risk benefits and measured at fair value, whereas today a significant amount of our variable annuity guarantees are carried as insurance. The ASU is expected to be effective as of January 1, 2021 and the Company is in the early stages of evaluating the new guidance and is therefore currently not able to estimate the impact to its financial statements. At current market interest rate levels, the ASU could result in a material decrease in our stockholders\u2019 equity, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial leverage ratio and could consequently adversely impact our financial strength ratings and our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, the ASU could also result in increased market sensitivity of our financial statements and results of operations. As a result, in the future we may consider making significant changes to our business including, without limitation, our variable annuity exposure management strategy.\nElements of our business strategy may not be effective in accomplishing our objectives\nOur objective is to leverage our competitive strengths to distinguish ourselves in the individual annuity and life insurance markets and, over the longer term, to generate more distributable cash from our business. We seek to achieve this by being a focused product manufacturer with an emphasis on independent distribution, while having the goal of achieving a competitive expense ratio through financial discipline. We aim to achieve our goals by focusing on target market segments, concentrating on product manufacturing, maintaining a strong balance sheet and using the scale of our seasoned in-force business to support the effectiveness of our risk management program, and focusing on operating cost and flexibility. See \u201cBusiness - Overview.\u201d\nThere can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful as it may not adequately alleviate the risks relating to focused product offerings; volatility of, and capital requirements with respect to, variable annuities; risk of loss with respect to use of derivatives in hedging transactions; and greater dependence on a relatively small number of independent distributors to market our products and generate most of our sales. Furthermore, such distributors may be subject to differing commission structures depending on the product sold and there can be no assurance that these new commission structures will be acceptable. See \u201c- General Risks - We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our distribution channels.\u201d We may also be unable to reduce operating costs and enhance efficiencies, at least initially, due to the increased costs as a result of the Separation, as well as the cost and duration of transitional services agreements. For these reasons, no assurances can be given that we will be able to execute our strategy or that our strategy will achieve our objectives.\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\nFinancial strength ratings are published by various nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d) and similar entities not formally recognized as NRSROs. They indicate the NRSROs\u2019 opinions regarding an insurance company\u2019s ability to meet contract holder and policyholder obligations and are important to maintaining public confidence in our products and our competitive position. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Rating Agencies\u201d for additional information regarding our financial strength ratings, including current rating agency ratings and outlooks.\nDowngrades in our financial strength ratings or changes to our ratings outlooks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including:\n\u2022\nreducing new sales of insurance products and annuity products;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries;\n\u2022\nincreasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contract holders and policyholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive;\n\u2022\nproviding termination rights for the benefit of our derivative instrument counterparties;\n\u2022\nproviding termination rights to cedents under assumed reinsurance contracts;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices, if at all; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to potentially increased regulatory scrutiny.\nCredit ratings are opinions of each agency with respect to specific securities and contractual financial obligations and the issuer\u2019s ability and willingness to meet those obligations when due, and are important factors in our overall financial profile, including funding profiles, and our ability to access certain types of liquidity. Downgrades in our credit or financial strength ratings or changes to our rating outlook could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including limiting our access to distributors, restricting our ability to generate new sales because our products depend on strong financial strength ratings to compete effectively, limiting our access to capital markets, and potentially increasing the cost of debt, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn view of the difficulties experienced by many financial institutions as a result of the financial crisis and ensuing global recession, including our competitors in the insurance industry, we believe it is possible that the NRSROs will continue to heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, will continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, will continue to request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any NRSRO. Any such downgrade could result in a reduction in new sales of our insurance products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have significant indebtedness that for a period of time will not provide us with interest-expense tax deductions and the terms of which could restrict our operations and use of funds that may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition\nWe incurred significant indebtedness in the form of debt securities issued to investors and bank debt from third-party lenders, which we are required to service with cash at BHF as well as dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and other operating subsidiaries. The funds needed to service our indebtedness will not be available to meet any short-term liquidity needs we may have, invest in our business, pay any potential dividends on our common stock or carry out any share or debt repurchases that we may undertake. Furthermore, BHF was incorporated in 2016 and our life insurance subsidiaries were transferred to it on July 28, 2017. Pursuant to current IRS regulations, BHF will not be permitted to join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with our insurance subsidiaries for a period of five taxable years following the completion of the Separation. Additionally, the Tax Act limits the deductibility of interest expense. As a result, we may not be able to fully deduct the interest payments on certain indebtedness we incurred at BHF in connection with the Separation or certain other borrowings from the taxable income of our insurance subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $4.0 billion of total long-term consolidated indebtedness outstanding. On February 1, 2019, we entered into a new term loan agreement with respect to a new $1.0 billion five-year unsecured term loan facility, which replaced our former $600 million unsecured term loan facility, which was scheduled to expire on December 2, 2019. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our indebtedness and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. In addition, our significant leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. Our significant leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general. See also \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Primary Sources of Liquidity and Capital\u201d for more details about our indebtedness, including the two term loan facilities described in this paragraph.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness and the holders of the defaulted indebtedness could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that indebtedness to be due and payable immediately.\nOur credit facilities and our reinsurance financing arrangement contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, including in certain cases requirements to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth and to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization not in excess of a specified percentage, and limitations on the dollar amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries, which could restrict our operations and use of funds. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company.\u201d Failure to comply with the covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility or fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, would restrict the ability to access the Revolving Credit Facility when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Primary Sources of Liquidity and Capital - Credit Facilities\u201d for a discussion of our credit facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the indebtedness retained or incurred in connection with the Separation, as well as any future indebtedness that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash to meet our debt obligations in the future is sensitive to capital market returns, primarily due to our variable annuity business. Overall, our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative, regulatory, client behavioral, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe lenders who hold our indebtedness could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. If we are not able to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including significant business and legal entity restructuring, limited new business investment, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the insurance industry could be impaired. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses\nAs part of our overall risk management strategy, our insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance from third-party reinsurers for certain risks we underwrite. While reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business. In certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase. Also, under certain of our reinsurance arrangements, it is common for the reinsurer to have a right to increase reinsurance rates on in-force business if there is a systematic deterioration of mortality in the market as a whole. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue. See \u201cBusiness - Reinsurance Activity.\u201d\nIf the counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements or to the derivatives we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\nWe use reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general, reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives do not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, indemnitors, counterparties and central clearinghouses. A reinsurer\u2019s, indemnitor\u2019s, counterparty\u2019s or central clearinghouse\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance agreements, indemnity agreements or derivatives agreements with us or inability or unwillingness to return collateral could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we use derivatives to hedge various business risks. We enter into a variety of derivatives, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties on a bilateral basis for uncleared OTC derivatives and with clearing brokers and central clearinghouses for OTC-cleared derivatives (OTC derivatives that are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties). See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Derivatives.\u201d If our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivatives, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. Such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2005, our former parent, MetLife acquired The Travelers Insurance Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d) from Citigroup. The Connecticut-based Travelers entity was redomesticated to Delaware in 2014, merged with two affiliated life insurance companies and a former offshore reinsurance subsidiary and renamed MetLife USA, now Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. Prior to this acquisition, Travelers agreed to reinsure a 90% quota share of its long-term care insurance business to certain affiliates of General Electric Company (\u201cGE\u201d), which following a spin-off became part of Genworth Financial, Inc. (\u201cGenworth\u201d) and subsequently agreed to reinsure the remaining 10% quota share of such long-term care insurance business to what became Genworth. The applicable Genworth reinsurers, Genworth Life Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company of New York, established trust accounts for our benefit to secure their obligations under such arrangements requiring that they maintain qualifying collateral with an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 102% of the statutory reserves attributable to the long-term care insurance business. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Travelers by MetLife, Citigroup agreed to indemnify MetLife for losses and certain other payment obligations MetLife might incur with respect to the long-term care insurance business reinsured by Genworth. Prior to the Separation, MetLife assigned its indemnification rights to us with the consent of Citigroup. Further, as disclosed in Genworth\u2019s filings with the SEC, the Genworth reinsurers have retroceded the long-term care insurance business assumed from Brighthouse Life Insurance Company to an indirect subsidiary of GE, Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (\u201cUFLIC\u201d), which has established trust accounts for the Genworth reinsurers\u2019 benefit to secure UFLIC\u2019s obligations under such arrangements. GE has also agreed, under a capital maintenance agreement, to maintain sufficient capital in UFLIC to maintain UFLIC\u2019s RBC above a specified minimum level.\nAlthough the reinsurers are primarily obligated for the liabilities of the long-term care insurance business, such reinsurance arrangements do not relieve Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of its direct liability under the ceded long-term care insurance policies. The long-term care insurance business of Travelers had reserves of $6.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company had reinsurance recoverables of $6.6 billion associated with the reinsurance transaction with Genworth at December 31, 2018. Although the Genworth reinsurers have established trust accounts for our benefit to secure their obligations to us, if they become insolvent and the amounts in the trust accounts they established are insufficient to pay their obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Also, notwithstanding the Citigroup indemnity and the Genworth reinsurers\u2019 arrangements with UFLIC, if we are unable to take credit for reinsurance or are forced to recapture any of the long-term care insurance business ceded to the Genworth reinsurers, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to take credit for reinsurance, our statutory life insurance reserve financings may be subject to cost increases and new financings may be subject to limited market capacity\nWe currently utilize capital markets solutions to finance a portion of our statutory reserve requirements for several products, including, but not limited to, our level premium term life products subject to the NAIC Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (\u201cRegulation XXX\u201d), and ULSG subject to NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (\u201cGuideline AXXX\u201d). In 2017, we merged certain of our affiliate reinsurance companies into BRCD, a licensed reinsurance subsidiary of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. This single, larger reinsurance subsidiary provides certain benefits to Brighthouse, including (i) enhancing the ability to hedge the interest rate risk of the reinsured liabilities, (ii) allowing increased allocation flexibility in managing an investment portfolio, and (iii) improving operating flexibility and administrative cost efficiency, but there can be no assurance that such benefits will continue to materialize. BRCD obtained statutory reserve financing through a funding structure involving a single financing arrangement supported by a pool of highly rated third-party reinsurers. The restructured financing facility matures in 2037, and therefore, we may need to refinance this facility in the future and any such refinancing may not be at costs attractive to us or may not be available at all. If such financing cannot be obtained on favorable terms, our statutory capitalization, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our competitiveness, could be adversely affected.\nFuture capacity for these statutory reserve funding structures in the marketplace is not guaranteed. During 2014, the NAIC approved a new regulatory framework applicable to the use of captive insurers in connection with Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX transactions. Among other things, the framework called for more disclosure of an insurer\u2019s use of captives in its statutory financial statements and narrows the types of assets permitted to back statutory reserves that are required to support the insurer\u2019s future obligations. In 2014, the NAIC implemented the framework through an actuarial guideline (\u201cAG 48\u201d), which requires the actuary of the ceding insurer that opines on the insurer\u2019s reserves to issue a qualified opinion if the framework is not followed.\nThe requirements of AG 48 became effective as of January 1, 2015 in all states, without any further action necessary by state legislatures or insurance regulators to implement them and apply prospectively to new policies issued and new reinsurance transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2015. AG 48 does not apply to policies included under captive reinsurance and certain other agreements that were in existence prior to January 1, 2015.\nIn December 2016, the NAIC adopted a new model regulation containing similar substantive requirements as AG 48. The model regulation will generally replace AG 48 in a state upon the state\u2019s adoption of the model regulation. To the extent the types of assets permitted under AG 48 or under the new model regulation to back statutory reserves relating to these captive transactions are not available in future statutory reserve funding structures, we would not be able to take some or all statutory reserve credit for such transactions and could consequently be required to materially affect the statutory capitalization of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nExtreme mortality events resulting from catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims and reinsurance availability\nOur life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. For example, significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century. The likelihood, timing, and severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output, as well as on the financial markets. In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors or of other companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses we experience. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. A catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Conversely, improvements in medical care and other developments which positively affect life expectancy can cause our assumptions with respect to longevity, which we use when we price our products, to become incorrect and, accordingly, can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFactors affecting our competitiveness may adversely affect our market share and profitability\nWe believe competition among insurance companies is based on a number of factors, including service, product features, scale, price, actual or perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. We face intense competition from a large number of other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability and financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. In some circumstances, national banks that sell annuity products of life insurers may also have a pre-existing customer base for financial services products. These competitive pressures may adversely affect the persistency of our products, as well as our ability to sell our products in the future. In addition, new and disruptive technologies may present competitive risks. If, as a result of competitive factors or otherwise, we are unable to generate a sufficient return on insurance policies and annuity products we sell in the future, we may stop selling such policies and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d\nWe have limited control over many of our costs. For example, we have limited control over the cost of Unaffiliated Third-Party Reinsurance, the cost of meeting changing regulatory requirements, and our cost to access capital or financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain a cost advantage over our competitors. If our cost structure increases and we are not able to achieve or maintain a cost advantage over our competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our strategy, as well as on our results of operations and financial condition. If we hold substantially more capital than is needed to support credit ratings that are commensurate with our business strategy, over time, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, since numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation, legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment for our business may have, over time, the effect of supporting or burdening some aspects of the financial services industry. This can affect our competitive position within the annuities and life insurance industry, and within the broader financial services industry. See \u201c- Regulatory and Legal Risks\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d\nThe failure of third parties to provide various services, or any failure of the practices and procedures that these third parties use to provide services to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business\nA key part of our operating strategy is to leverage third parties to deliver certain services important to our business. We have arrangements with DXC for the administration of both in-force policies and new life and annuities business. Pursuant to one of these arrangements, certain in-force policies previously housed on up to 20 systems will be consolidated. At least 13 of such systems will be consolidated into one. We intend to focus on further sourcing opportunities with third-party vendors and external investment managers, including after agreements with MetLife companies, including a transition services agreement with MetLife pursuant to which MetLife provides us with certain administrative and other services including, among others, certain finance, treasury, compliance, operations, call center and technology support services for a transitional period (the \u201cTransition Services Agreement\u201d), expire. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife - Our contractual arrangements with MetLife may not be adequate to meet our operational and business needs. The terms of our arrangements with MetLife may be more favorable than we would be able to obtain from an unaffiliated third party, and we may be unable to replace those services in a timely manner or on comparable terms\u201d for information regarding the potential effect that the Separation may have on the pricing of such services. It may be difficult, disruptive and more expensive for us to replace some of our third-party vendors in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future (as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise), and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, if a third-party provider fails to provide the administrative, operational, financial, actuarial or other services we require, fails to meet contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, suffers a cyberattack or other security breach or fails to provide material information on a timely basis, our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife - Our contractual arrangements with MetLife may not be adequate to meet our operational and business needs. The terms of our arrangements with MetLife may be more favorable than we would be able to obtain from an unaffiliated third party, and we may be unable to replace those services in a timely manner or on comparable terms\u201d and \u201c- Operational Risks - The failure in cyber- or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in Brighthouse\u2019s, our third-party service providers\u2019 or MetLife\u2019s disaster recovery systems and business continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\u201d\nSimilarly, if any third-party provider, including MetLife, DXC or an external investment manager experiences any deficiency in internal controls, determines that its practices and procedures used in administering our policies require review or otherwise fails to administer our policies in accordance with appropriate standards, we could incur expenses and experience other adverse effects as a result. In these situations, we may be unable to resolve any issues on our own without assistance from the third-party provider, and we may have limited ability to influence the speed and effectiveness of that resolution. In December 2017, for example, MetLife announced that it was undertaking a review of practices and procedures used to estimate its reserves related to certain group annuitants that have been unresponsive or missing over time. As a result of this review, MetLife identified and announced in 2018 a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting relating to certain group annuity reserves and announced that it was recording charges to reinstate reserves previously released. As a result of that review and based on information provided by MetLife, we identified approximately 14,000 group annuitants across Brighthouse entities who may be owed annuity payments now or in the future. We announced a related increase in reserves of $38 million after tax during the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to legacy non-retail group annuity contracts that are pension risk transfers included in our Run-off segment.\nThese group annuity contracts and many of our other products are administered by MetLife under the Transition Services Agreement, and we depend on MetLife for the information and assistance in modifying administrative practices and procedures. We also depend on MetLife for information and assistance in reviewing administrative practices and procedures and reserves with respect to other products it administers for us. From time to time, MetLife has brought to our attention practices, procedures and reserves with respect to other products that require further review. While we do not believe, based on the information made available to us to date by MetLife, that any of the matters MetLife has brought to our attention will require material modifications to reserves or have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, we are reliant upon MetLife to provide further information and assistance with respect to those products. There can also be no assurance that such matters will not require material modifications to reserves or have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future, or that MetLife will provide further information and assistance.\nIf material issues were to arise with respect to any of our products administered by third parties, whether involving MetLife, DXC or another third-party provider, any resulting expenses or other economic or reputational harm could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly if they involved our core annuity and life insurance businesses.\nIn addition, we could be subject to litigation or regulatory investigations and actions resulting from any such issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our deferred income tax assets or liabilities, including changes in our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine whether they are realizable. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate future taxable income. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. Changes in the statutory tax rate could also affect the value of our deferred income tax assets and may require a write-off of some of those assets. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nIf our business does not perform well or if actual experience versus estimates used in valuing and amortizing DAC and VOBA vary significantly, we may be required to accelerate the amortization and/or impair the DAC and VOBA, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance business are deferred and referred to as DAC. Value of business acquired (\u201cVOBA\u201d) represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance and annuity contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially determined projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable life and deferred annuity contracts are amortized in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The amount of future gross profit is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation.\nIf actual gross profits are less than originally expected, then the amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in a charge to net income. Significant or sustained equity market declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of DAC and VOBA related to variable annuity and variable life contracts, resulting in a charge to net income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\u201d for a discussion of how significantly lower net investment spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period.\nEconomic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks\nIf difficult conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally persist or are perceived to persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally, as well as by the global economy to the extent it affects the U.S. economy. In addition, while our operations are entirely in the U.S., we have foreign investments in our general and separate accounts and, accordingly, conditions in the global capital markets can affect the value of our general account and separate account assets, as well as our financial results. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in financial asset classes or various capital markets can have an adverse effect on us, both because we have a large investment portfolio and our benefit and claim liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. In addition, perceived difficult conditions in the capital markets may discourage individuals from making investment decisions and purchasing our products. Market factors include interest rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices, derivative prices and availability, real estate markets, foreign exchange rates and the volatility and the returns of capital markets. Our business operations and results may also be affected by the level of economic activity, such as the level of employment, business investment and spending, consumer spending and savings; monetary and fiscal policies and their resulting impact on economic activity and conditions like inflation and credit formation. Accordingly, both market and economic factors may affect our business results by adversely affecting our business volumes, profitability, cash flow, capitalization and overall financial condition, our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and meet our obligations at our holding company. Disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Upheavals and stagnation in the financial markets can also affect our financial condition (including our liquidity and capital levels) as a result of the impact of such events on our assets and liabilities.\nAt times throughout the past several years, volatile conditions have characterized financial markets. Significant market volatility in reaction to geopolitical risks, changing monetary policy and uncertain fiscal policy may exacerbate some of the risks we face. The Federal Reserve began to reduce the size of its balance sheet and may continue to raise interest rates as it unwinds the monetary accommodation put in place after the global financial crisis in 2008 to 2009. The European Central Bank began to reduce monetary accommodation in the latter half of 2018, while other major central banks continue to pursue accommodative, unconventional monetary policies. Uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom\u2019s potential withdrawal from the European Union, coupled with concerns around U.S./China trade relations have also contributed to market volatility globally. If this U.S./China trade conflict remains unresolved, the U.S. and China may impose tariffs on imports from each other, with a resultant increase in costs and uncertainty that may affect corporate profits and economic activity. Increased market volatility may affect the performance of the various asset classes in which we invest, as well as separate account values. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Current Environment\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends and Uncertainties - Financial and Economic Environment.\u201d\nTo the extent these uncertain financial market conditions persist, our revenues, reserves and net investment income, as well as the demand for certain of our products, are likely to come under pressure. Similarly, sustained periods of low interest rates and risk asset returns could reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures such as hedging, causing our profit margins to erode as a result of reduced income from our investment portfolio and increase in insurance liabilities. Extreme declines in equity markets could cause us to incur significant capital and/or operating losses due to, among other reasons, the impact on us of guarantees related to our annuity products, including increases in liabilities, increased capital requirements, and/or collateral requirements associated with our risk transfer arrangements. Even in the absence of a financial market downturn, sustained periods of low market returns, and/or low level of U.S. interest rates and/or heightened market volatility may increase the cost of our insurance liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our statutory capital and earnings, as well as impair our financial strength ratings.\nVariable annuity products issued through separate accounts are a significant portion of our in-force business. The account values of these products decrease as a result of declining equity markets. Lower interest rates may result in lower returns in the future due to lower returns on our investments. Decreases in account values reduce certain fees generated by these products, cause the amortization of DAC to accelerate, could increase the level of insurance liabilities we must carry to support such products issued with any associated guarantees and could require us to provide additional funding to BRCD. Even absent declining equity and bond markets, periods of sustained stagnation in these markets, which are characterized by multiple years of low annualized total returns impacting the growth in separate accounts and/or low level of U.S. interest rates, may materially increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits due to inherent market return guarantees in these liabilities. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our annuity and insurance products could be adversely affected as customers are unwilling or unable to purchase our products. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations and lapses or surrenders of policies. Furthermore, our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Such adverse changes in the economy could negatively affect our earnings and capitalization and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDifficult conditions in the U.S. capital markets and the economy generally may also continue to raise the possibility of legislative, judicial, regulatory and other governmental actions. We cannot predict what regulatory proposals may be made or what legislation may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201c- Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth\u201d and \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - Factors affecting our competitiveness may adversely affect our market share and profitability.\u201d\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital\nThe capital and credit markets may be subject to periods of extreme volatility. Disruptions in capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity and credit capacity or limit our access to capital which may in the future be needed to operate our business and meet policyholder obligations.\nWe need liquidity at our holding company to pay our operating expenses, pay interest on our indebtedness, carry out any share or debt repurchases that we may undertake, pay any potential dividends on our common stock, provide our subsidiaries with cash or collateral, maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations and limit the investments necessary to grow our business.\nFor our insurance subsidiaries, the principal sources of liquidity are insurance premiums and fees paid in connection with annuity products, and cash flow from our investment portfolio to the extent consisting of cash and readily marketable securities.\nIn the event capital market or other conditions have an adverse impact on our capital and liquidity, or our stress-testing indicates that such conditions could have such an impact beyond expectations and our current resources do not satisfy our needs or regulatory requirements, we may have to seek additional financing to enhance our capital and liquidity position. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as the then current market conditions, regulatory capital requirements, availability of credit to us and the financial services industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and the perception of our customers and lenders regarding our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large operating or investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, our liquidity requirements may change if, among other things, we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending agreements or other collateral requirements. See \u201cInvestments-Related Risks - Should the need arise, we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or in our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given that not all assets are liquid,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - Collateral for Securities Lending and Derivatives\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Liquidity.\u201d\nSuch conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements, and access the capital necessary to grow our business. See \u201c- Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\u201d As a result, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of securities than we would have otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risks which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause our net investment income and net income to vary from period to period\nWe are exposed to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global capital and credit markets, including changes and volatility in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, real estate, foreign currency, commodity prices, performance of the obligors included in our investment portfolio (including governments), derivatives (including performance of our derivatives counterparties) and other factors outside our control. We may be exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market downturn or market volatility.\nInterest rate risk\nSome of our current or anticipated future products, principally traditional life, universal life and fixed annuities, as well as funding agreements and structured settlements, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or \u201cnet investment spread,\u201d or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we earn on general account investments intended to support the obligations under such contracts. Our net investment spread is a key component of our net income.\nWe are affected by the monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively, with the Federal Reserve Board, the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and other major central banks, as such policies may adversely impact the level of interest rates and, as discussed below, the income we earn on our investments or the level of product sales.\nIn a low interest rate environment, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, which will reduce our net investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and commercial, agricultural or residential mortgage loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, thereby exacerbating this risk. Although reducing interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in net investment spreads on some products, our ability to reduce these rates is limited to the portion of our in-force product portfolio that has adjustable interest crediting rates and could be limited by the actions of our competitors or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our net investment spread would decrease or potentially become negative, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations and financial condition. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities.\u201d\nOur estimation of future net investment spreads is an important component in the amortization of DAC and VOBA. Significantly lower than anticipated net investment spreads can reduce our net income and may cause us to accelerate amortization, which would result in a reduction of net income in the affected reporting period and potentially negatively affect our credit instrument covenants or the rating agencies\u2019 assessment of our financial condition.\nDuring periods of declining interest rates, our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations may decrease. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, our reserves for policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened. Accordingly, declining and sustained lower interest rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our ability to take dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and significantly reduce our profitability.\nIncreases in interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest rate sensitive products competitive. Therefore, we may have to accept a lower credit spread and lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals, terminations and substantial policy amendments may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA; such events may reduce our net income and potentially negatively affect our credit instrument covenants and the rating agencies\u2019 assessments of our financial condition. An increase in interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans that comprise a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Finally, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee revenue associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\nWe manage interest rate risk as part of our asset and liability management strategies, which include (i) maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and (ii) a hedging program. For certain of our liability portfolios, it is not possible to invest assets to the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets, as is the case with certain retirement products, we may support such liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or other mismatch mitigation strategies. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate or other mismatch risk of our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. The level of interest rates also affects our liabilities for benefits under our annuity contracts. As interest rates decline we may need to increase our reserves for future benefits under our annuity contracts, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Market Risk - Fair Value Exposures - Interest Rates.\u201d\nIn addition, while we use a risk mitigation strategy relating to our ULSG portfolio intended to reduce our risk to statutory capitalization and long-term economic exposures from sustained low levels of interest rates, this strategy will likely result in higher net income volatility due to the insensitivity of GAAP liabilities to the change in interest rate levels. This strategy may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - Our ULSG asset requirement target may not ensure we have sufficient assets to meet our future ULSG policyholder obligations and may result in net income volatility\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Risk Management Strategies - ULSG Market Risk Exposure Management.\u201d\nOur exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price volatility and investment risk associated with the fluctuation in credit spreads. Widening credit spreads may cause unrealized losses in our investment portfolio and increase losses associated with credit-based derivatives. Increases in credit spreads of issuers due to credit deterioration may result in higher level of impairments. Tightening credit spreads may reduce our investment incomes and cause an increase in the reported value of certain liabilities that are valued using a discount rate that reflects our own credit spread. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks can also adversely affect the cost of our borrowing if we need to access credit markets.\nChanges to LIBOR\nThere is currently uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and any financial instruments or agreements currently using LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate may be adversely affected. As a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of LIBOR, actions by regulators, law enforcement agencies or the ICE Benchmark Administration, the current administrator of LIBOR may result in changes to the manner in\nwhich LIBOR is determined. Additionally, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021, which is expected to result in these widely used reference rates no longer being available. The Federal Reserve began publishing a secured overnight funding rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At this time, it is not possible to predict how such changes or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities and derivatives, including those held in our investment portfolio. Such changes or reforms may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Furthermore, we previously entered into agreements, including for our Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness, that currently reference LIBOR and may be adversely affected by any changes or reforms to LIBOR or discontinuation of LIBOR, including if such agreements are not amended prior to any such changes, reform or discontinuation.\nEquity risk\nOur primary exposure to equity relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our businesses where fee income is earned based upon the estimated market value of the separate account assets and other assets related to our variable annuity business. Because fees generated by such products are primarily related to the value of the separate account assets and other AUM, a decline in the equity markets could reduce our revenues as a result of the reduction in the value of the investment assets supporting those products and services. In particular, the variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets could decrease revenues and earnings with respect to those products. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits which means that if the equity markets were to decline or stagnate, our potential benefits exposure to such products would increase. We seek to mitigate the impact of such increased exposures through the use of derivatives, reinsurance and capital management. However, such derivatives and reinsurance may become less available and, if they remain available, their price could materially increase in a period characterized by volatile equity markets. The risk of stagnation in equity market returns cannot be addressed by hedging. See \u201cBusiness - Segments and Corporate & Other - Annuities - Current Products - Variable Annuities\u201d for details regarding sensitivity of our variable annuity business to capital markets.\nIn addition, a portion of our investments are in leveraged buy-out funds and other private equity funds. The amount and timing of net investment income from such funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments. As a result, the amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period. Significant volatility could adversely impact returns and net investment income on these alternative investments. In addition, the estimated fair value of such investments may be affected by downturns or volatility in equity or other markets. See \u201c- Investments-Related Risks - Our valuation of securities and investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\u201d\nReal estate risk\nA portion of our investment portfolio consists of mortgage loans on commercial, agricultural and residential real estate. Our exposure to this risk stems from various factors, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility, interest rate fluctuations, agricultural prices and farm incomes. Although we manage credit risk and market valuation risk for our commercial, agricultural and residential real estate assets through geographic, property type and product type diversification and asset allocation, general economic conditions in the commercial, agricultural and residential real estate sectors will continue to influence the performance of these investments. These factors, which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nObligor-related risk\nFixed income securities and mortgage loans represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within asset-backed securities (\u201cABS\u201d), including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening mortgage or credit spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers, guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities and mortgage loans could cause the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and our earnings to decline and the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio to increase.\nDerivatives risk\nWe use the payments we receive from the counterparties of the derivative instruments we have entered into to hedge changes in the fair value of our assets and liabilities and current or future changes in cash flows. We enter into a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate various business risks, including options, futures, forwards, and interest rate and credit default swaps with a number of counterparties. Amounts that we expect to collect under current and future derivatives are subject to counterparty credit risk. We remain liable for the obligations under the products that we sold even if our derivatives counterparties do not pay us under the derivatives we have entered into to mitigate or hedge such obligations. Our derivatives counterparties\u2019 defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Substantially all of our derivatives (whether entered into bilaterally with specific counterparties or cleared through a clearinghouse) require us to pledge and/or receive collateral or make payments related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives. In addition, ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of derivative counterparties may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the affected businesses. Furthermore, the valuation of our derivatives could change based on changes to our valuation methodology or the discovery of errors.\nFederal banking regulators adopted rules that apply to certain qualified financial contracts, including many derivatives contracts, securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements, with certain banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules, which became applicable on January 1, 2019, generally require the banking institutions and their applicable affiliates to include contractual provisions in their qualified financial contracts that limit or delay certain rights of the counterparties to such banking institutions and applicable affiliates, including counterparties\u2019 default rights (such as the right to terminate the contracts or foreclose on collateral) and restrictions on assignments and transfers of credit enhancements (such as guarantees) arising in connection with the banking institution or an applicable affiliate becoming subject to a bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or similar proceeding. To the extent that any of the derivatives, securities lending agreements or repurchase agreements that we enter into are subject to these rules, it could increase our risk or limit our recovery in the event of a default by such banking institutions or their applicable affiliates.\nSummary\nEconomic or counterparty risks and other factors described above, and significant volatility in the markets, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses, derivative losses, change in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves for future policyholder benefits, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.\nMarket price volatility can also make it difficult to value certain assets in our investment portfolio if trading in such assets becomes less frequent, for example, as was the case during the 2008 financial crisis. In such case, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and may require additional reserves. Significant volatility in the markets could cause changes in the credit spreads and defaults and a lack of pricing transparency which, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Investment Risks.\u201d\nInvestments-Related Risks\nShould the need arise, we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or in our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given that not all assets are liquid\nThere may be a limited market for certain investments we hold in our investment portfolio, making them relatively illiquid. These include privately-placed fixed maturity securities, derivative instruments such as options, mortgage loans, policy loans, leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests, and real estate equity, such as real estate joint ventures and funds. In the past, even some of our very high-quality investments experienced reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption. If we were forced to sell certain of our investments during periods of market volatility or disruption, market prices may be lower than our carrying value in such investments. This could result in realized losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our financial ratios, which could affect compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures.\nSimilarly, we loan blocks of our securities to third parties (primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks) through our securities lending program, including fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. Under this program, we obtain collateral, usually cash, at the inception of a loan and typically purchase securities with the cash collateral. Upon the return to us of these loaned securities, we must return to the third-party the cash collateral we received. If the cash collateral has been invested in securities, we need to sell the securities. However, in some cases, the maturity of those securities may exceed the\nterm of the related securities on loan and the estimated fair value of the securities we need to sell may fall below the amount of cash received.\nIf we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral in connection with our securities lending or otherwise need significant amounts of cash on short notice and we are forced to sell securities, we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions, or both. In the event of a forced sale, accounting guidance requires the recognition of a loss for securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities based on our ability to hold those securities, which would negatively impact our financial condition, as well as our financial ratios, which could affect compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures. In addition, under stressful capital market and economic conditions, liquidity broadly deteriorates, which may further restrict our ability to sell securities. Furthermore, if we decrease the amount of our securities lending activities over time, the amount of net investment income generated by these activities will also likely decline. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Securities Lending.\u201d\nOur requirements to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in estimated fair value of derivatives transactions or specified assets in connection with OTC-cleared, OTC-bilateral transactions and exchange traded derivatives may adversely affect our liquidity, expose us to central clearinghouse and counterparty credit risk, and increase our costs of hedging\nMany of our derivatives transactions require us to pledge collateral related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives transactions executed through a specific broker at a clearinghouse or entered into with a specific counterparty on a bilateral basis. The amount of collateral we may be required to pledge and the payments we may be required to make under our derivatives transactions may increase under certain circumstances as a result of the requirement to pledge initial margin for OTC-bilateral transactions entered into after the phase-in period, which we expect to be applicable to us in September 2020 as a result of the adoption by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, Farm Credit Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency and the CFTC of final margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives.\u201d\nGross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities and defaults, downgrades or other events may result in future impairments to the carrying value of such securities, resulting in a reduction in our net income\nFixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d) and are, therefore, excluded from net income. In recent periods, as a result of low interest rates, the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity securities have exceeded the unrealized losses. However, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains would decrease, and our unrealized losses would increase, perhaps substantially. The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these AFS securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and impairment charges to earnings are taken. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS.\u201d\nThe occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d), commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d) and ABS (collectively, \u201cStructured Securities\u201d) could cause the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and corresponding earnings to decline and cause the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect. With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected. Similarly, a ratings downgrade affecting a security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated and could increase the capital we must hold to support that security to maintain our RBC levels. Levels of write-downs or impairments are impacted by intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed maturity securities, which have declined in value. Realized losses or impairments on these securities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in, or at the end of, any quarterly or annual period.\nOur valuation of securities and investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition\nFixed maturity and equity securities, as well as short-term investments that are reported at estimated fair value, represent the majority of our total cash and investments. We define fair value generally as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening\ncredit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. In addition, in times of financial market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. In those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and management judgment. Valuations may result in estimated fair values which vary significantly from the amount at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated and combined financial statements and the period-to-period changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly. Decreases in the estimated fair value of securities we hold may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Estimated Fair Value of Investments.\u201d\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. We reflect any changes in allowances and impairments in earnings as such evaluations are revised. However, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. In addition, any such future impairments or allowances could have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and financial position. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Investment Impairments.\u201d\nDefaults on our mortgage loans and volatility in performance may adversely affect our profitability\nOur mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. We establish valuation allowances for estimated impairments, which are based on loan risk characteristics, historical default rates and loss severities, real estate market fundamentals, such as housing prices and unemployment, and outlooks, as well as other relevant factors (for example, local economic conditions). In addition, substantially all of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans held-for-investment have balloon payment maturities. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments or fluctuations in their performance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, any geographic or property type concentration of our mortgage loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolio and consequently on our results of operations or financial condition. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated. Moreover, our ability to sell assets may be limited if other market participants are seeking to sell fungible or similar assets at the same time. In addition, scrutiny of the residential mortgage industry continues and there may be legislative proposals that would allow or require modifications to the terms of mortgage loans could be enacted. We cannot predict whether any such proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business or investments. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Mortgage Loans.\u201d\nThe defaults or deteriorating credit of other financial institutions could adversely affect us\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and investment funds and other financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of the default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities, derivatives, joint ventures, and equity investments. Further, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in response to the financial crisis affecting the global banking system and financial markets, such as investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, whether under existing legal authority or any new authority that may be created, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks\u2019 credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. Any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to financial and operational integration risks while we transition to a multiple manager investment platform, and following such transition, we will continue to be subject to the risks related to using external investment managers\nWe entered into a new investment management agreement (the \u201cInvestment Management Agreement\u201d) with MetLife Investment Advisors, LLC (\u201cMLIA\u201d) as part of our strategy to begin transitioning to a multiple manager platform. The Investment\nManagement Agreement replaces several investment management agreements we had previously entered into with MLIA in connection with the Separation. As part of the termination of the prior investment management agreements, we brought our derivatives trading, which had previously been managed by MLIA, in-house. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Investment Management Agreements.\u201d As we transition to a multiple manager platform and partially terminate the investment management services with MLIA under the Investment Management Agreement, such services are expected to be replaced by similar services provided by a select group of experienced external asset management firms. During the transition to a multiple manager platform and to insource derivatives trading, we will be subject to financial and operational risks related to switching service providers, including, but not limited to, a disruption in services and difficulties in integration. Following the transition of services, our Investment Department will monitor external investment managers in accordance with detailed investment guidelines, but we will continue to be subject to the risks of relying on third-party investment managers, which are described elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nThe continued threat of terrorism, ongoing military actions as well as other catastrophic events may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the level of claim losses we incur\nThe continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, as well as other natural or man-made catastrophic events may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The value of assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of catastrophic events. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Catastrophic events could also disrupt our operations centers in the U.S. and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities.\u201d\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOur insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth\nOur insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. Our insurance company operating subsidiaries are domiciled in Delaware, Massachusetts and New York. Each entity is subject to regulation by its primary state regulator and is also subject to other regulation in states in which it operates. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d as supplemented by discussions of regulatory developments in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends - Regulatory Developments.\u201d\nNAIC\nThe NAIC is an organization whose mission is to assist state insurance regulatory authorities in serving the public interest and achieving the insurance regulatory goals of its members, the state insurance regulatory officials. State insurance regulators may act independently or adopt regulations proposed by the NAIC. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Some NAIC pronouncements take effect automatically in the various states, particularly with respect to accounting issues. Statutes, regulations and interpretations may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting and reserve requirements. Changes in existing laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, can sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of us that could, if determined adversely, have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2018, the NAIC adopted a new framework that will apply to all of our existing variable annuity business and may materially change the sensitivity of reserve and capital requirements to capital markets including interest rate, equity markets and volatility, our estimates of which historically did not reflect the impact of variable annuity capital reform or changes in the statutory tax rate, as well as prescribed assumptions for policyholder behavior. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - NAIC.\u201d Since the implementation details are very early in their development, it is not possible to predict what impacts this reform will have on current risk mitigation and hedging programs. See \u201c- Our analyses of scenarios and\nsensitivities utilized in connection with our variable annuity risk management strategies involve significant estimates based on assumptions that may result in material differences from actual outcomes compared to the sensitivities calculated under such scenarios\u201d and \u201c- Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\u201d\nIn addition, following the reduction in the statutory tax rate pursuant to the Tax Act, the NAIC reviewed the methodology by which taxes are incorporated into the RBC calculation. On August 7, 2018 the NAIC Plenary adopted changes to the RBC calculation effective December 31, 2018 to reflect the lower statutory tax rate, which will result in a reduction to our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 RBC ratios. If such revisions to the NAIC\u2019s RBC calculation would result in a reduction in the RBC ratio for one or more of our insurance subsidiaries below certain prescribed levels, we may be required to hold additional capital in such subsidiary or subsidiaries. See \u201c- A decrease in the RBC ratio (as a result of a reduction in statutory surplus and/or increase in RBC requirements) of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and rating agencies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nThe NAIC has adopted a new approach for the calculation of life insurance reserves, known as PBR. PBR became operative on January 1, 2017 in those states where it has been adopted, to be followed by a three-year phase-in period for business issued on or after this date. With respect to the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the Delaware Department of Insurance implemented PBR on January 1, 2017, and Massachusetts enacted legislation adopting PBR on January 2, 2019. New York enacted legislation adopting PBR in December 2018, and, at the same time, the NYDFS adopted a temporary regulation to implement PBR while it develops a final regulation.\nThe NAIC is considering revisions to RBC factors for bonds and real estate, as well as developing RBC charges for longevity risk. We cannot predict the impact of any potential proposals that may result from these studies.\nWe can give no assurances that any of our expectations will be met regarding the capital and reserve impacts or compliance costs, if any, that may result from the above initiatives.\nState insurance guaranty associations\nMost of the jurisdictions in which we transact business require life insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations. These associations are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers, or those that may become impaired, insolvent or fail, for example, following the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. In addition, certain states have government owned or controlled organizations providing life insurance to their citizens. The activities of such organizations could also place additional stress on the adequacy of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations also have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the guaranty associations described above. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements.\u201d\nIn December of 2017, the NAIC approved revisions to its Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act governing assessments for long-term care insurance. The revisions include a 50/50 split between life and health carriers for future long-term care insolvencies, the inclusion of HMOs in the assessment base, and no change to the premium tax offset. Several states have enacted the provisions of the Model Act into law, and more states are expected to propose legislation in their upcoming legislative sessions.\nIt is possible that additional insurance company insolvencies or failures could render the guaranty funds from assessments previously levied against us inadequate and we may be called upon to contribute additional amounts, which may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in a particular period. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate, but additional liabilities may be necessary. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements.\u201d\nFederal - Insurance regulation\nCurrently, the federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, Dodd-Frank established the FIO within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to, among other things, collect information about the insurance industry, negotiate covered agreements with one or more foreign governments and recommend prudential standards. On December 12, 2013, the FIO issued a report, mandated by Dodd-Frank, which, among other things, urged the states to modernize and promote greater uniformity in insurance regulation. The report raised the possibility of a greater role for the federal government if states do not achieve greater uniformity in their laws and regulations. Following the transition occurring in the federal government and the priorities of the Trump administration, we cannot predict whether any such legislation or\nregulatory changes will be adopted, or what impact they will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Trump administration and the Republican party have expressed goals to dismantle or roll back Dodd-Frank and President Trump has issued an executive order that calls for a comprehensive review of Dodd-Frank in light of certain enumerated core principles of financial system regulation. We are not able to predict whether any such proposal to roll back Dodd-Frank will be implemented and whether it would have a material effect on our business operations and cannot currently identify the risks, if any, that may be posed to our businesses as a result of changes to, or legislative replacements for, Dodd-Frank.\nFederal legislation and administrative policies can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies, including policies regarding financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies.\nDepartment of Labor and ERISA considerations\nWe manufacture annuities for third parties to sell to tax-qualified pension plans, retirement plans and IRAs, as well as individual retirement annuities sold to individuals that are subject to ERISA or the Tax Code. Also, a portion of our in-force life insurance products and annuity products are held by tax-qualified pension and retirement plans. While we currently believe manufacturers do not have as much exposure to ERISA and the Tax Code as distributors, certain activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Tax Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of the ERISA Plan participants and beneficiaries, and those fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Tax Code are subject to enforcement by the DOL, the IRS and the PBGC.\nIn addition, the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Tax Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA qualified plans, plan participants and IRA owners if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen. Similarly, without an exemption, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\nStandard of Conduct Regulation\nAs a result of overlapping efforts by the DOL, the NAIC, individual states, and the SEC to impose fiduciary-like requirements in connection with the sale of annuities and life insurance policies, there have been a number of proposed or adopted changes to the laws and regulations that govern the conduct of our business and the firms that distribute our products. As a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, we do not directly distribute our products to consumers. However, regulations establishing a standard of conduct in connection with the distribution and sale of these products could affect our business by imposing greater compliance, oversight, disclosure and notification requirements on us. Moreover, regulations such as Regulation 187 will increase our obligations to supervise the sales of certain products by our third-party distributors to ensure such products are being sold in compliance with the applicable standard of conduct. Many of these efforts are still in the proposal stage, and their future impact on the way we conduct our business and the products we sell is unclear.\nWe cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what legislation or regulations may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any future legislation or regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty could create confusion among our distribution partners and customers, which could negatively impact product sales. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Standard of Conduct Regulation\u201d for a more detailed discussion of particular regulatory efforts by various regulators.\nA decrease in the RBC ratio (as a result of a reduction in statutory surplus and/or increase in RBC requirements) of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and rating agencies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition\nThe NAIC has established model regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for insurance companies. The RBC formula for life insurance companies establishes capital requirements relating to asset, insurance, interest rate, market and business risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities that contain certain guaranteed minimum death and living benefits. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to RBC standards and/or other minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of domicile. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based Capital.\u201d\nIn any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by the insurance subsidiary (which itself is sensitive to equity\nmarket and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital such insurer must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value and credit ratings of certain fixed-income and equity securities in its investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments that do not receive hedge accounting and changes in interest rates, as well as changes to the RBC formulas and the interpretation of the NAIC\u2019s instructions with respect to RBC calculation methodologies. Our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their own internal models, which differ from the RBC capital model, that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we or our insurance subsidiaries should hold relative to the rating agencies\u2019 expectations. Under stressed or stagnant capital market conditions and with the aging of existing insurance liabilities, without offsets from new business, the amount of additional statutory reserves that an insurance subsidiary is required to hold may materially increase. This increase in reserves would decrease the statutory surplus available for use in calculating the subsidiary\u2019s RBC ratios. To the extent that an insurance subsidiary\u2019s RBC ratio is deemed to be insufficient, we may seek to take actions either to increase the capitalization of the insurer or to reduce the capitalization requirements. If we were unable to accomplish such actions, the rating agencies may view this as a reason for a ratings downgrade.\nThe failure of any of our insurance subsidiaries to meet its applicable RBC requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on its ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A decline in RBC ratios, whether or not it results in a failure to meet applicable RBC requirements, may limit the ability of an insurance subsidiary to make dividends or distributions to us, could result in a loss of customers or new business, and could be a factor in causing ratings agencies to downgrade financial strength ratings, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank provisions compelling the liquidation of certain types of financial institutions could materially and adversely affect us, as such a financial institution and as an investor in or counterparty to other such financial institutions, as well as our respective investors\nUnder provisions of Dodd-Frank, if we or another financial institution were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on our or its respective obligations and it was determined that such default would have serious effects on financial stability in the United States, we or such other financial institution could be compelled to undergo liquidation with the FDIC as receiver. This new regime, however, did not change existing state laws requiring an insurance company such as Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, BHNY or NELICO, that becomes insolvent or is in danger of defaulting on its insurance obligations to be rehabilitated or liquidated with the state\u2019s insurance regulator appointed as receiver. If the FDIC were to be appointed as the receiver for another type of company (including an insurance holding company such as BHF), the liquidation of that company would occur under the provisions of the new liquidation authority, and not under the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations. In an FDIC-managed liquidation, holders of a company\u2019s debt could in certain respects be treated differently than they would be under the Bankruptcy Code and similarly situated creditors could be treated differently. In particular, unsecured creditors and shareholders are intended to bear the losses of the company being liquidated. These provisions could also apply to some financial institutions whose debt securities Brighthouse holds in its investment portfolios and could adversely affect the respective positions of creditors and the value of their respective holdings.\nWe are subject to federal and state securities laws and regulations and rules of self-regulatory organizations which, among other things, require that we distribute certain of our products through a registered broker-dealer; failure to comply with these laws or changes to these laws may have a material adverse effect on our operations and our profitability\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that are also \u201csecurities,\u201d including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, to the separate accounts that issue them, and to certain fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts (\u201cregistered fixed annuity contracts\u201d). Such laws and regulations require these products to be distributed through a broker-dealer that is registered with the SEC and certain state securities regulators and is also a member of FINRA. Accordingly, by offering and selling variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance policies and registered fixed annuity contracts, and in managing certain proprietary mutual funds associated with those products, we are subject to, and bear the costs of compliance with, extensive broker-dealer regulation under federal and state securities laws, as well as FINRA rules. Due to the increased operating and compliance costs, the profitability of issuing these products is uncertain.\nWe utilize Brighthouse Securities to distribute our variable and registered fixed products. Brighthouse Securities is a FINRA member and a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and applicable state regulators.\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets, protect investment advisory and brokerage clients, and ensure the integrity of the financial markets. These laws and regulations generally grant regulatory and self-regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers impacting new and existing products.\nThese powers include the power to adopt new rules to regulate the issuance, sale and distribution of our products and powers to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with securities laws and regulations. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Advisor Regulation.\u201d\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 led to significant changes in economic and financial markets that have, in turn, led to a dynamic competitive landscape for variable and registered fixed annuity contract issuers. Our ability to react to rapidly changing market and economic conditions will depend on the continued efficacy of provisions we have incorporated into our product design allowing frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements and our ability to work collaboratively with federal securities regulators. Changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could adversely impact our ability to react to such changing conditions.\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could reduce our earnings and materially impact our operations by increasing our corporate taxes and making some of our products less attractive to consumers\nChanges in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition and could result in our incurring materially higher statutory taxes. Higher tax rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Conversely, if tax rates decline it could adversely affect the desirability of our products.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law, resulting in sweeping changes to the Tax Code. The Tax Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21%, limited deductibility of interest expense, increased capitalization amounts for deferred acquisition costs, eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax, provided for determining reserve deductions as 92.81% of statutory reserves, and reduced the dividend received deduction. Most of the changes in the Tax Act were effective as of January 1, 2018.\nOur actual results may differ from our current estimate due to, among other things, further guidance that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities or regulatory bodies and/or changes in interpretations and assumptions we have preliminarily made.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations are increasingly common in our businesses and may result in significant financial losses and/or harm to our reputation\nWe face a significant risk of litigation actions and regulatory investigations in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our pending legal actions and regulatory investigations include proceedings specific to us, as well as other proceedings that raise issues that are generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. In addition, the Master Separation Agreement that sets forth our agreements with MetLife relating to the ownership of certain assets and the allocation of certain liabilities in connection with the Separation (the \u201cMaster Separation Agreement\u201d) allocated responsibility among MetLife and Brighthouse with respect to certain claims (including litigation or regulatory actions or investigations where Brighthouse is not a party). As a result, we may face indemnification obligations with respect to such claims.\nIn connection with our insurance operations, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, investments, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may be difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, at trial, or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us and risks to our business presented by these proceedings, if any, are discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant legal costs and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees could be materially and adversely impacted. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may also cause volatility in the price of BHF stock and stocks of companies in our industry.\nCurrent claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and other proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against\nus. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings in any of the jurisdictions where we operate could result in new legal actions and precedents or changes in laws, rules or regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital-Related Risks\nAs a holding company, BHF depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends\nBHF is a holding company for its insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. We depend on the cash at the holding company as well as dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay common stock dividends, if any. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Parent Company - Liquidity and Capital - Statutory Capital and Dividends.\u201d\nIf the cash BHF receives from its subsidiaries is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, BHF may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. Our ability to access funds through such methods is subject to prevailing market conditions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. In addition, the tax separation agreement that we entered into with MetLife in connection with the Separation, which, among other things, governs the allocation between MetLife and us of the responsibility for the taxes of the MetLife group (the \u201cTax Separation Agreement\u201d), contains restrictions that may, for a period of time, restrict or limit our ability to issue additional common stock or sell assets. See \u201c- Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks - Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital.\u201d\nThe payment of dividends and other distributions to BHF by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of dividends or other payments to BHF by its insurance subsidiaries if they determine that the payment could be adverse to the interests of our policyholders or contract holders. In connection with our affiliated reinsurance company restructuring, the Delaware Department of Insurance approved the payment of a dividend from BRCD to its parent, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, which we completed in May 2017. Any additional dividends by BRCD are subject to the approval of the Delaware Department of Insurance. Any requested payment of dividends by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company and NELICO to BHF, or by BHNY to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, in excess of their respective ordinary dividend capacity would be considered an extraordinary dividend subject to prior approval by the Delaware Department of Insurance and the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, and the NYDFS, respectively. The payment of dividends and other distributions by insurance companies is also influenced by business conditions including those described in the Risk Factors above and rating agency considerations. See \u201c- Regulatory and Legal Risks - A decrease in the RBC ratio (as a result of a reduction in statutory surplus and/or increase in RBC requirements) of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and rating agencies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d See also \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Parent Company - Liquidity and Capital - Statutory Capital and Dividends.\u201d\nOperational Risks\nGaps in our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business\nWe have developed risk management policies and procedures to reflect the ongoing review of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not be fully effective, leaving us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks. In addition, we rely on third-party providers to administer and service many of our products, and our risk management policies and procedures may not enable us to identify and assess every risk with respect to those products, especially to the extent we rely on those providers for detailed information regarding the holders of our products and other relevant information.\nMany of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based on the use of observed historical market behavior to model or project potential future exposure. Models used by our business are based on assumptions and projections which may be inaccurate. Business decisions based on incorrect or misused model output and reports could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Model risk may be the result of a model being misspecified for its intended purpose, being misused or producing incorrect or inappropriate results. Models used by our business may not operate properly and could contain errors related to model inputs, data, assumptions, calculations, or output which could give rise to adjustments to models that may adversely impact our results of operations. As a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate.\nOther risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will follow our risk management policies and procedures, nor can there be any assurance that our risk management policies and procedures, or the risk management policies and procedures of third parties that administer or service our products, will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit our exposures based on our assessments. In addition, we may have to implement more extensive and perhaps different risk management policies and procedures under pending regulations. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - Our variable annuity exposure management strategy may not be effective, may result in net income volatility and may negatively affect our statutory capital.\u201d\nThe failure in cyber- or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in Brighthouse\u2019s, our third-party service providers\u2019 or MetLife\u2019s disaster recovery systems and business continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of computer systems. For some of these systems, we rely on third-parties, including our outside vendors and distributors and, for the duration of the Transition Services Agreement and other agreements with MetLife companies. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions, including processing new business, claims, and post-issue transactions, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses, managing our investments and maintaining financial records. Such computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to a variety of forms of cyberattacks with the objective of gaining unauthorized access to Brighthouse systems and data or disrupting Brighthouse operations. These include, but are not limited to, phishing attacks, account takeover attempts, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, and other computer-related penetrations. Administrative and technical controls and other preventive actions taken to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks or other security breaches to such computer systems. In some cases, such physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks or other security breaches may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA disaster such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, cyberattack or war, unanticipated problems with our or our vendors\u2019 disaster recovery systems or, for the duration of the Transition Services Agreement and other agreements with MetLife companies, MetLife\u2019s disaster recovery systems, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial position, particularly if those problems affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our or MetLife\u2019s managers were unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide goods and services and our employees\u2019 ability to perform their job responsibilities.\nA failure of our or relevant third-party computer systems could cause significant interruptions in our operations, result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and legal claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues, and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. There can be no assurance that our information security policies and systems in place can prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including nonpublic personal information. In addition, the availability and cost of insurance for operational and other risks relating to our business and systems may change and any such change may affect our results of operations. See also \u201c- General Risks - Any failure to protect the confidentiality of client and employee information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nOur associates and those of our third-party service providers may take excessive risks which could negatively affect our financial condition and business\nAs an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of accepting certain risks. The associates who conduct our business include executive officers and other members of management, sales intermediaries, investment professionals, product managers, and other associates, as well as associates of our third-party service providers, and certain associates of MetLife who provide services to us in connection with the Transition Services Agreement, the Investment Management Agreement, or other agreements, including agreements to provide certain third-party administration services. Each of these associates makes decisions and choices that may expose us to risk. These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines and standards, product design and pricing, determining what assets to purchase for investment and when to sell them, which business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. Associates may take excessive risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices.\nSimilarly, our controls and procedures designed to monitor associates\u2019 business decisions and prevent them from taking excessive risks, and to prevent employee misconduct, may not be effective. If our associates and those of our third-party service providers take excessive risks, the impact of those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.\nGeneral Risks\nWe may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our distribution channels\nWe distribute our products exclusively through a variety of third-party distribution channels. Our agreements with the third-party distributors may be terminated by either party with or without cause. We may periodically renegotiate the terms of these agreements, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If we are unable to maintain our relationships our sales of individual insurance, annuities and investment products could decline, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our distributors may elect to suspend, alter, reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us for various reasons, including changes in our distribution strategy, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions, or concerns about market-related risks. We are also at risk that key distribution partners may merge, consolidate, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or that new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - Elements of our business strategy may not be effective in accomplishing our objectives.\u201d Also, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key internal associates who conduct our business, including wholesalers and financial advisors, our sales could decline.\nThe Separation prompted some third parties to re-price, modify or terminate their distribution or vendor relationships with us. An interruption or significant change in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we rely on a core number of our distributors to produce the majority of our sales. If any one such distributor were to terminate its relationship with us or reduce the amount of sales which it produces for us our results of operations could be adversely affected. An increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. Consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.\nBecause our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite our training and compliance programs. If our products are distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business.\nIn addition, our distributors may also sell our competitors\u2019 products. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do, these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors\u2019 products instead of ours. In connection with the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group (\u201cMPCG\u201d) to MassMutual, we entered into an agreement in 2016 that permits us to serve as the exclusive manufacturer for certain proprietary products which are offered through MassMutual\u2019s career agent channel. We partnered with MassMutual to develop the initial product distributed under this arrangement, the Index Horizons fixed indexed annuity, and agreed on the terms of the related reinsurance. While the agreement has a term of 10 years, it is possible that MassMutual may terminate our exclusivity or the agreement itself in specified circumstances, such as our inability or failure to provide product designs that reasonably meet MassMutual requirements. Although we expect MassMutual to be an important distribution partner with respect to certain of our products, we believe that the level of sales, if any, produced through this channel will be materially less than the levels produced historically through MPCG.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel to support our business\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We compete with other financial services companies for personnel primarily on the basis of compensation, support services and financial position. Intense competition exists for key personnel with demonstrated ability, and we may be unable to hire or retain such personnel. The loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business due to loss of their skills, knowledge of our business, their years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel in North Carolina or elsewhere who are prepared to relocate. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to fill open positions or replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of client and employee information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nPursuant to federal and state laws, various government agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, most states have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. Many of the associates who conduct our business have access to, and routinely process, personal information through a variety of media, including information technology systems. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of personal information that is accessible to us, or in our possession or the possession of our associates. It is possible that an associate could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential personal information. Our data has been the subject of cyberattacks and could be subject to additional attacks. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our associates fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we analyze customer data to better manage our business. There has been increased scrutiny and proposed additional regulation, including from state regulators, regarding the use of customer data. We may analyze customer data or input such data into third-party analytics. Any inquiry in connection with our analytics business practices, as well as any misuse or alleged misuse of those analytics insights, could cause reputational harm or result in regulatory enforcement actions or litigation, and any related limitations imposed on us could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c- Operational Risks - The failure in cyber- or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in Brighthouse\u2019s, our third-party service providers\u2019 or MetLife\u2019s disaster recovery systems and business continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\u201d\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. This would represent a diversion of resources that may be significant, and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete with other insurance companies and financial institutions. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife - The Separation could adversely affect our business and profitability due to MetLife\u2019s strong brand and reputation.\u201d\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims by third parties for (i) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (ii) breach of patent, trademark or copyright license usage rights, or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. Any such claims or resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages or lead to changes in business operations. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses or could be required to make changes in business operations. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly alternative. Any of these scenarios could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe could face difficulties, unforeseen liabilities, asset impairments or rating actions arising from business acquisitions or dispositions\nWe may engage in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses. Such activity exposes us to a number of risks arising from (i) potential difficulties achieving projected financial results including the costs and benefits of integration or deconsolidation; (ii) unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments; (iii) the scope and duration of rights to indemnification for losses; (iv) the use of capital which could be used for other purposes; (v) rating agency reactions; (vi) regulatory requirements that could impact our operations or capital requirements; (vii) changes in statutory accounting principles or GAAP, practices or policies; and (viii) certain other risks specifically arising from activities relating to a legal entity reorganization.\nOur ability to achieve certain financial benefits we anticipate from any acquisitions of businesses will depend in part upon our ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an efficient and effective manner. There may be liabilities or asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing acquisition-related due diligence investigations. Furthermore, even for obligations and liabilities that we do discover during the due diligence process, neither the valuation adjustment nor the contractual protections we negotiate may be sufficient to fully protect us from losses.\nWe may from time to time dispose of business or blocks of in-force business through outright sales, reinsurance transactions or by alternate means. After a disposition, we may remain liable to the acquirer or to third parties for certain losses or costs arising from the divested business or on other bases. We may also not realize the anticipated profit on a disposition or incur a loss on the disposition. In anticipation of any disposition, we may need to restructure our operations, which could disrupt such operations and affect our ability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow such business pending the completion of such transaction. In addition, the actions of key employees of the business to be divested could adversely affect the success of such disposition as they may be more focused on obtaining employment, or the terms of their employment, than on maximizing the value of the business to be divested. Furthermore, transition services or tax arrangements related to any such separation could further disrupt our operations and may impose restrictions, liabilities, losses or indemnification obligations on us. Depending on its particulars, a separation could increase our exposure to certain risks, such as by decreasing the diversification of our sources of revenue. Moreover, we may be unable to timely dissolve all contractual relationships with the divested business in the course of the proposed transaction, which may materially adversely affect our ability to realize value from the disposition. Such restructuring could also adversely affect our internal controls and procedures and impair our relationships with key customers, distributors and suppliers. An interruption or significant change in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife\nIf the Separation were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax liabilities\nThe Separation was conditioned on the continued validity as of the Separation date of the private letter ruling that MetLife has received from the IRS regarding certain significant issues under the Tax Code, and the receipt and continued validity as of the Separation date of an opinion from MetLife\u2019s tax advisor that the Separation qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss to MetLife and MetLife\u2019s shareholders pursuant to Sections 355 and 361 of the Tax Code, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares, each subject to the accuracy of and compliance with certain representations, assumptions and covenants therein.\nNotwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine that the Separation should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or covenants on which the private letter ruling is based are untrue or have been violated. Furthermore, as part of the IRS\u2019s policy, the IRS did not determine whether the Separation satisfies certain conditions that are necessary to qualify for non-recognition treatment. Rather, the private letter ruling is based on representations by MetLife and us that these conditions have been satisfied.\nThe tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. In addition, the tax advisor relied on certain representations and covenants that have been delivered by MetLife and us.\nIf the IRS ultimately determines that the Separation is taxable, we could incur significant federal income tax liabilities, and we could have an indemnification obligation to MetLife. For a more detailed discussion, see \u201c- Potential indemnification obligations if the Separation does not qualify for non-recognition treatment or if certain other steps that are part of the Separation do not qualify for their intended tax treatment could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\u201d\nPotential indemnification obligations if the Separation does not qualify for non-recognition treatment or if certain other steps that are part of the Separation do not qualify for their intended tax treatment could materially adversely affect our financial condition\nGenerally, taxes resulting from the failure of the Separation to qualify for non-recognition treatment for federal income tax purposes would be imposed on MetLife or MetLife\u2019s shareholders and, under the Tax Separation Agreement, MetLife is generally obligated to indemnify us against such taxes if the failure to qualify for tax-free treatment results from any action or inaction that is within MetLife\u2019s control or if the failure results from any direct or indirect transfer of MetLife\u2019s stock. MetLife may have an adverse interpretation of or object to its indemnification obligations to us under the Tax Separation Agreement, and there can be no assurance that MetLife will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligation to us or that such indemnification will be sufficient to us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance by MetLife. The failure of MetLife to fully indemnify us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, MetLife will generally bear tax-related losses due to the failure of certain steps that were part of the Separation to qualify for their intended tax treatment. However, the IRS could seek to hold us responsible for such liabilities, and under the Tax Separation Agreement, we could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify MetLife and its affiliates against certain tax-related liabilities caused by those failures, to the extent those liabilities result from an action we or our affiliates take\nor from any breach of our or our affiliates\u2019 representations, covenants or obligations under the Tax Separation Agreement. Events triggering an indemnification obligation under the Tax Separation Agreement include ceasing to actively conduct our business and events occurring after the Separation that cause MetLife to recognize a gain under Section 355(e) of the Tax Code. If the Separation does not qualify for non-recognition treatment or if certain other steps that are part of the Separation do not qualify for their intended tax treatment, we could be required to pay material additional taxes or an indemnification obligation to MetLife, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe could be required to pay material additional taxes or suffer other material adverse tax consequences if the tax consequences of the Separation to us are not as expected\nThe Separation is expected to have certain federal income tax consequences to MetLife and to us, as set forth in a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to MetLife and opinions provided by MetLife\u2019s tax advisors. These opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the tax opinions and the private letter ruling do not address all of the tax consequences of the Separation to us. The Separation is a complex transaction subject to numerous tax rules, including rules that could require us to reduce our tax attributes (such as the basis in our assets) in certain circumstances, and the application of these various rules to the Separation is not entirely clear. The ultimate tax consequences to us of the Separation may not be finally determined for many years and may differ from the tax consequences that we and MetLife currently expect and intend to report. As a result, we could be required to pay material additional taxes and to materially reduce the tax assets (or materially increase the tax liabilities) on our consolidated balance sheet. These changes could impact our available capital, ratings or cost of capital. There can be no assurance that the Tax Separation Agreement will protect us from any such consequences, or that any issue that may arise will be subject to indemnification by MetLife under the Tax Separation Agreement. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDisputes or disagreements with MetLife may affect our financial statements and business operations, and our contractual remedies may not be sufficient\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship, including the Transition Services Agreement, the Tax Separation Agreement and a tax receivables agreement that provides MetLife with the right to receive future payments from us as partial consideration for its contribution of assets to us (the \u201cTax Receivables Agreement\u201d). Our agreements with MetLife may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiation between unaffiliated parties. Such provisions may include, among other things, indemnification rights and obligations, the allocation of tax liabilities, and other payment obligations between us and MetLife. Disagreements regarding the obligations of MetLife or us under these agreements or any renegotiation of their terms could create disputes that may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our shareholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that any remedies available under these agreements will be sufficient to us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance by MetLife or that any such remedies will be sufficiently broad to cover any issues that arise under our arrangements with MetLife. The failure of MetLife to perform its obligations under these agreements (or claims by MetLife that we have failed to perform our obligations under the agreements) may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and could consume substantial resources and attention thus creating a material adverse impact on our business performance.\nWe are required to pay MetLife for certain tax benefits, which amounts are expected to be material\nIn partial consideration for the assets contributed by MetLife to us, we have entered into a Tax Receivables Agreement with MetLife that provided for the payment by us to MetLife of 86% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in federal income tax that Brighthouse Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries actually realize as a result of the utilization of net operating losses, capital losses, tax basis and amortization or depreciation deductions in respect of certain tax benefits we may realize as a result of certain transactions involved in the Separation, together with interest accrued from the date the applicable tax return is due (without extension) until the date the applicable payment is due.\nEstimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivables Agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The actual amount and utilization of net operating losses, tax basis and other tax attributes, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 taxable income in the future. The Base Case Scenario has not assumed any benefit from the deferred taxes that are subject to the Tax Receivables Agreement.\nIf we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivables Agreement or undergo a change of control as defined in the Tax Receivables Agreement, the Tax Receivables Agreement will terminate and we will be required to make a lump sum payment equal to the present value of expected future payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement, which payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 future taxable income. Additionally, if we or a direct or indirect subsidiary transfers any asset to a corporation with which we do not file a consolidated income tax return,\nwe will be treated as having sold that asset for its fair market value in a taxable transaction for purposes of determining the cash savings in income tax under the Tax Receivables Agreement. If we sell or otherwise dispose of any of our subsidiaries in a transaction that is not a change of control, we will be required to make a payment equal to the present value of future payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement attributable to the tax benefits of such subsidiary that is sold or disposed of, applying the assumptions described above. Any such payment resulting from a breach of material obligations, change of control, asset transfer or subsidiary disposition could be substantial and could exceed our actual cash tax savings.\nWe have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the transactions, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility\nEven if the Separation otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 of the Tax Code, it may be taxable to MetLife, but not MetLife\u2019s shareholders, under Section 355(e) of the Tax Code if 50% or more (by vote or value) of our common stock or MetLife\u2019s common stock is acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Separation. For this purpose, any acquisitions of MetLife\u2019s or our common stock within two years before or after the Separation are presumed to be part of such a plan, although MetLife or we may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a \u201csafe harbor\u201d described in the tax regulations. We have provided numerous covenants not to engage in certain transactions for two years after the Separation and have agreed to indemnify MetLife if we do not comply with such covenants. These covenants and indemnity obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business, and may discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our shareholders may consider favorable, including limiting our ability to use our equity to raise capital or fund acquisitions. Any payments required under these indemnity obligations could be significant and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Separation could adversely affect our business and profitability due to MetLife\u2019s strong brand and reputation\nPrior to the Separation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, we marketed our products and services using the \u201cMetLife\u201d brand name and logo. We have also benefited from certain trademarks licensed to us by MetLife in connection with the Separation. We believe the association with MetLife helped drive awareness of our brand among our customers, distributors, third-party service providers and other persons due to MetLife\u2019s globally recognized brand, reputation and services, as well as its strong capital base and financial strength.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into an intellectual property license agreement with MetLife, pursuant to which we and MetLife granted each other a non-exclusive, royalty-free, paid-up license for the United States to certain intellectual property rights we each own (the \u201cIntellectual Property License Agreement\u201d). Under the Master Separation Agreement and the Intellectual Property License Agreement, we had a license to use certain trademarks and the \u201cMetLife\u201d name in certain limited circumstances, which expired in early 2019. While we have undertaken operational and legal steps to develop the \u201cBrighthouse Financial\u201d brand, the fact that we are no longer able to use the \u201cMetLife\u201d name could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could result in reduced sales of our products.\nWe have established a portfolio of trademarks in the United States that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including a trademark for our name, \u201cBrighthouse Financial,\u201d and our logo design. We have also filed other trademark applications in the United States, including for product names and potential taglines. However, the registration of some of these trademarks is not complete and they may not all ultimately become registered. Our use of the Brighthouse Financial name for the Company or for our existing or any new products in the United States has been challenged by third parties, and we were involved in legal proceedings to protect or defend our rights with respect to the Brighthouse Financial name and trademarks. Although the parties to these proceedings have resolved this matter and dismissed the action, it is possible that other challenges to our trademarks could arise in the future.\nAs a result of the Separation, some of our existing policyholders, contract owners and other customers have chosen, and some may, in the future, choose to stop doing business with us, which could increase the rate of surrenders and withdrawals in our policies and contracts. In addition, other potential policyholders and contract owners may decide not to purchase our products because we are no longer a part of MetLife.\nOur contractual arrangements with MetLife may not be adequate to meet our operational and business needs. The terms of our arrangements with MetLife may be more favorable than we would be able to obtain from an unaffiliated third party, and we may be unable to replace those services in a timely manner or on comparable terms\nWe have contractual arrangements, such as the Transition Services Agreement, the Investment Management Agreement and the Intellectual Property License Agreement that require MetLife affiliates to provide certain services to us, including certain IT services pursuant to software license agreements that MetLife affiliates have with certain third-party software vendors, and investment management and investment management services with respect to Brighthouse\u2019s general account portfolio and certain\nseparate account assets of our insurance subsidiaries, as well as assets of BHF and our non-insurance subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that the services provided by the MetLife affiliates will be sufficient to meet our operational and business needs, that the MetLife affiliates will continue to be able to perform such functions in a manner satisfactory to us, that MetLife\u2019s practices and procedures will continue to enable it to adequately administer the policies it handles, that we will receive sufficient information from MetLife with respect to the policies it administers for us or that any remedies available under these arrangements will be sufficient to us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - The failure of third parties to provide various services, or any failure of the practices and procedures that these third parties use to provide services to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u201d\nAs agreements between us and MetLife affiliates continue to expire, be terminated, or be replaced by other third parties to provide services, there can be no assurance that these services will be sustained at the same levels as they were when we were receiving such services from MetLife or that we will be able to obtain the same benefits from another provider or our indemnity rights from such third parties will not be limited. We may not be able to replace services and arrangements in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including cost, as favorable as those we have previously received from MetLife. Certain agreements with the MetLife affiliates were entered into in the context of intercompany relationships that arose from enterprise-wide agreements with vendors, and we may have to pay higher prices for similar services from MetLife or unaffiliated third parties in the future.\nThere are incremental costs as a separate, public company\nAs a result of the Separation, we needed to replicate or replace certain functions, systems and infrastructure. We have begun to make infrastructure investments in order to operate without MetLife\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure. These initiatives involve substantial costs, the integration of a large number of new employees, and integration of the new and expanded operations and infrastructure with our existing operations and infrastructure and, in some cases, the operations and infrastructure of our vendors and other third parties. They also require significant time and attention from our senior management and others throughout the Company, in addition to their day-to-day responsibilities running the business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and expand the operations and infrastructure to the extent required, in the time, or at the costs anticipated, and without disrupting our ongoing business operations in a material way, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business benefited from MetLife\u2019s purchasing power when procuring goods and services. As a standalone company, we may be unable to obtain such goods and services at comparable prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained prior to the Separation, which could decrease our overall profitability. See \u201c- Our contractual arrangements with MetLife may not be adequate to meet our operational and business needs. The terms of our arrangements with MetLife may be more favorable than we would be able to obtain from an unaffiliated third party, and we may be unable to replace those services in a timely manner or on comparable terms.\u201d\nIn addition, we have a large number of shareholders, including MetLife shareholders and beneficiaries of the MetLife Policyholder Trust established in connection with the demutualization of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\u201cMLIC\u201d) in April 2000, who received shares of our common stock in connection with the Separation. This large number of shareholders with full voting rights may have a significant impact on matters brought to a shareholder vote and other aspects of our corporate governance. We may also incur significant costs in connection with a such a large shareholder base, including mailing costs and vendor fees related to servicing the needs of our shareholders.\nWe have agreed under the Master Separation Agreement with MetLife to indemnify MetLife, its directors, officers and employees and certain of its agents for liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain events relating to our business\nThe Master Separation Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, we will indemnify, hold harmless and defend MetLife and certain related individuals (generally including MetLife\u2019s directors, officers and employees and certain agents), from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain events relating to our business. We cannot predict whether any event triggering this indemnity will occur or the extent to which we may be obligated to indemnify MetLife or such related individuals. In addition, the Master Separation Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, MetLife will indemnify, hold harmless and defend us and certain related individuals (generally including our directors, officers and employees and certain agents), from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain events relating to its business. There can be no assurance that MetLife will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligation to us or that such indemnification will be sufficient to us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance by MetLife.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a separate, public company and the cost of achieving such benefits may be more than we estimated\nWe believe that, as a separate, public company, we are able to, among other matters, better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, growth profile and strategic priorities, design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus and strategic priorities, streamline our processes and infrastructure to focus on our core manufacturing strengths, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics. However, we may be unable to achieve some or all of these benefits. For example, in order to position ourselves for the Separation, we undertook a series of strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations, including significant cost-cutting initiatives. These actions may not provide the cost benefits we currently expect, may cost more to achieve than we have estimated, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses. As a result, these actions could cause a weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of our key partner and supplier relationships. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a separate company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet any targets given by us or any change in any targets given by us, or changes by us to our target practices;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and the insurance industry;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nour business profile, dividend policy or market capitalization;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders and other large stockholders, including future sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations, including insurance laws and regulations, affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers\u2019 preferences;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting shareholders;\n\u2022\nepidemic disease, \u201cActs of God,\u201d war and terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nfailure to properly administer or pay claims;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe currently have no plans to declare or pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock\nWe currently have no plans to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use our future distributable earnings, if any, to pay debt obligations, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs, to carry out any share or debt repurchases that we may undertake, as well as for general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock in the near term, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which the shares currently trade. Any future declaration and payment of dividends or other distributions or returns of capital will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including capital requirements of our subsidiaries), and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing the debt we incurred, or debt that we may incur in the future, may limit or prohibit the payment of dividends. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends or make other distributions or returns on our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends, distributions or returns of capital.\nAny future sales by us or our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to decline\nAny transfer or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such transfer or sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of February 22, 2019, we had an aggregate of 116,670,471 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Such shares are generally freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for shares owned by one of our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. Shares held by \u201caffiliates\u201d may be sold in the public market if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144.\nWe also have a large shareholder base, including MetLife shareholders and beneficiaries of the MetLife Policyholder Trust established in connection with the demutualization of MLIC, who received shares of our common stock in connection with the Separation, and it is not possible to predict whether or not these and other shareholders will wish to sell their shares of our common stock. The sales of significant amounts of shares of our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our common stock.\nThe Brighthouse Board and its directors and officers may have limited liability to us and you for breach of fiduciary duty\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of our directors and officers will be personally liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). Currently, the DGCL provides that directors shall not be personally liable for a breach in fiduciary duties, except for liability for breach of their duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, dividend payments or stock repurchases that are unlawful under Delaware law or any transaction in which a director has derived an improper personal benefit.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers or stockholders\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our current or former directors, officers or stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former directors, officers or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional\ncosts associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nYour percentage ownership in Brighthouse may be diluted in the future\nYour percentage ownership in Brighthouse may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect to grant to our directors, officers and employees. We have adopted equity incentive plans that permit the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. We also adopted a tax-qualified employee stock purchase plan that permits eligible employees to acquire shares of our common stock at a discount to fair market value. In addition, we may issue common stock as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments we may make in the future or for currently unanticipated future development or unforeseen circumstances, given uncertainties related to our business.\nState insurance laws and Delaware corporate law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock\nState laws may delay, deter, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For example, such laws may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context.\nThe insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which our insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a business combination involving the Company. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states\u2019 statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Holding Company Regulation.\u201d These regulatory restrictions may delay, deter or prevent a potential merger or sale of our company, even if our Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of stockholders for us to merge or be sold. These restrictions also may delay sales by us or acquisitions by third parties of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Investment Company Act may require approval by the contract owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any affiliated investment advisor to a mutual fund underlying our variable contracts, including Brighthouse Advisers (formerly known as MetLife Advisers, LLC). Further, FINRA approval would be necessary for a change of control of any broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of BHF.\nSection 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including, among other things, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares of our capital stock, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons who, together with affiliates, own, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and may encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than attempt a hostile takeover. Such provisions include, among others:\n\u2022the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe division of our Board of Directors into classes of directors until such times as all directors are elected annually commencing at the Company\u2019s 2020 annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022the inability of our stockholders to remove directors other than for cause while the Board of Directors is classified; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock is required to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and to amend our amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Brighthouse and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage\nattempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. For additional tax considerations, see \u201cRisks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife - We have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the transactions, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\u201d", "PERMNO": 16816, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "BHF"}
