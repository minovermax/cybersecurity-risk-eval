{"cik": "1213037", "company": "Trovagene, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our securities could decline, and investors in our company may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a development stage company and may never earn a profit.\nWe are a development stage company and have incurred losses since our formation. As of December 31, 2015, we have an accumulated total deficit of approximately $108.9 million. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we had a net loss and comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $27.5 million. To date, we have experienced negative cash flow from development of our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. We have not generated any revenue from operations except for licensing, milestone and royalty income, and we expect to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future as we seek to further develop and commercialize our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. We cannot predict the extent of these future net losses, or when we may attain profitability, if at all. If we are unable to generate significant revenue from our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology or attain profitability, we will not be able to sustain operations.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology and any future tests, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will attain profitability, if ever. We may never become profitable and you may never receive a return on an investment in our common stock. An investor in our common stock must carefully consider the substantial challenges, risks and uncertainties inherent in the attempted development and commercialization of tests in the medical diagnostic industry. We may never successfully commercialize our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology or any future tests we may develop, and our business may not be successful.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital to commercialize our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or collaboration efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our cash balance was approximately $67.5 million and our working capital was approximately $60.2 million. Due to our recurring losses from operations and the expectation that we will continue to incur losses in the future, we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates. We have historically relied upon private and public sales of our equity, as well as debt financings to fund our operations. At December 31, 2015 we had $16.5 million outstanding under debt agreements. In order to raise additional capital, we may seek to sell additional equity and/or debt securities or obtain a credit facility or other loan, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor sentiment. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, restrict our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unfavorable terms.\nOur Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, and Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and our Loan and Security Agreement with SVB for equipment, each contain certain covenants that could adversely affect our operations. Additionally, if an event of default were to occur, we could be forced to repay the outstanding indebtedness sooner than expected and possibly at a time when we do not have sufficient capital to meet these obligations, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nWe have entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2014, with Oxford and SVB, or the Lenders, as amended, or the Loan and Security Agreement, for a term loan of $15.0 million. The term loan is secured by all of our assets, other than our intellectual property. In addition, we have entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2015, with SVB that provides for cash borrowings for equipment of up to $2.0 million, secured by the equipment financed, or the Equipment Line of Credit. The Loan and Security Agreement and the Equipment Line of Credit each contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into other entities;\n\u2022\nsell or assign any part of our business or property;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\npay dividends.\nAdditionally, we may be deemed to be in default under the Loan and Security Agreement and the Equipment Line of Credit upon the occurrence of certain events, including, among other things, payment defaults; breaches of representations, warranties or covenants; certain insolvency events; and the occurrence of certain material adverse changes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and following any cure period (if applicable), a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% per annum may be applied to the outstanding loan balance, and the Lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take certain other actions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement and the Equipment Line of Credit.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement and the Equipment Line of Credit could prevent us from taking certain actions without the consent of the Lenders and, if an event of default should occur, we could be required to immediately repay the outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to repay this debt, the Lenders may elect to foreclose on the secured collateral, including our cash accounts, and take other remedies permitted under the Loan and Security Agreement and the Equipment Line of Credit, as applicable. Even if we are able to repay the indebtedness upon the occurrence of an event of default, the repayment of these sums may significantly reduce our working capital and impair our ability to operate as planned. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance of these product candidates among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community and on our ability to successfully market our product candidates.\nThe use of our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology has never been commercialized for any indication. Even if approved for sale by the appropriate regulatory authorities, physicians may not order diagnostic tests based upon our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, in which event we may be unable to generate significant revenue or become profitable. Acceptance of our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nsuccessful integration into clinical practice;\n\u2022\nadequate reimbursement by third parties;\n\u2022\ncost effectiveness;\n\u2022\npotential advantages over alternative treatments; and\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration.\nWe will need to make leading physicians aware of the benefits of tests using our technology through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and favorable results from our clinical studies. In addition, we will need to gain support from thought leaders who believe that testing a urine specimen for molecular markers will provide superior performance. Ideally, we will need these individuals to publish support papers and articles which will be necessary to gain acceptance of our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain this support. Our failure to be successful in these efforts would make it difficult for us to convince medical practitioners to order cell-free molecular diagnostic tests for their patients and, consequently, would limit our revenue and profitability.\nWe currently have limited experience in marketing our products. If we are unable to expand our marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe have limited experience in marketing our products. We intend to expand our in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other molecular diagnostic companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nIf we are unable or later decide not to expand our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements for the sales and marketing of our product candidates or future products; however, we may not be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements or, if we are able to do so, we cannot guarantee that any sales force we use through such arrangements will be effective. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates internally. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing of our product candidates, which may negatively impact our ability to enter into favorable collaborative arrangements for the sale and marketing of our product candidates.\nIf our potential medical diagnostic tests are unable to compete effectively with current and future medical diagnostic tests targeting similar markets as our product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe medical diagnostic industry is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress. In each of our potential product areas, we face significant competition from large biotechnology, medical diagnostic and other companies.\nThe technologies associated with the molecular diagnostics industry are evolving rapidly and there is intense competition within the industry. Certain molecular diagnostics companies have established technologies that may be competitive to our product candidates and any future tests that we develop. Some of these tests may use different approaches or means to obtain diagnostic results, which could be more effective or less expensive than our tests for similar indications. Moreover, these and other future competitors have or may have considerably greater resources than we do in terms of technology, sales, marketing, commercialization and capital. These competitors also may have substantial advantages over us in terms of research and development expertise, experience in clinical studies, experience in regulatory issues, brand name exposure and expertise in sales and marketing as well as in operating central laboratory services. Many of these organizations have greater financial, marketing and human resources than we do; therefore, there can be no assurance that we can successfully compete with current or potential competitors, and any such competition could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nSince our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology is under development, we cannot predict the relative competitive position of any product based upon our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. However, we expect that the following factors, among others, will determine our ability to compete effectively: safety and efficacy; product price; turnaround time; ease of administration; performance; reimbursement; and marketing and sales capabilities.\nWe believe that many of our competitors spend significantly more on research and development-related activities than we do. Our competitors may discover new diagnostic tools or develop existing technologies to compete with our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if these competing products are more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than our product candidates\nOur failure to obtain human urine samples from medical institutions for our clinical studies will adversely impact the development of our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology.\nWe will need to establish relationships with medical institutions in order to obtain urine specimens from patients that test positive for a relevant infectious disease or from patients who have been diagnosed with solid tumors. We must obtain a sufficient number of samples in order to statistically prove the equivalency of the performance of our assays versus existing assays that are already on the market.\nCell-free nucleic acids in urine are stable at room temperature for extended periods of time with the addition of a simple preservative. Successful implementation of our cell-free nucleic acid technology in molecular testing is closely linked to the availability of techniques and procedures for cell-free nucleic acid preservation, purification and analysis. In the event urine specimens are not adequately preserved or are improperly stored or contaminated, we may be delayed in pursuing our clinical studies, and we may incur additional costs associated with procuring new human urine samples.\nIf the validity of an informed consent from a subject was to be challenged, we could be forced to stop using some of our resources, which would hinder our product development efforts.\nWe have measures in place to ensure that all clinical data and other samples that we receive from our clinical collaborators have been collected from subjects who have provided appropriate informed consent for the data and samples provided to be used for purposes that include commercial diagnostic product and test development activities. We have measures in place to ensure that data and samples that have been collected by our clinical collaborators are provided to us on a subject de-identified manner. We also have measures in place to ensure that the subjects from whom our data and samples are collected do not retain or have conferred on them any proprietary or commercial rights to the data or any discoveries derived from them. We rely on our clinical collaborators for appropriate compliance with the informed consent provided by each subject and with applicable regulations. A subject\u2019s informed consent could be challenged in the future, and any informed consent could prove invalid, unlawful or otherwise inadequate for our purposes. Any findings against us, or our clinical collaborators, could deny us access to or force us to stop using some of our clinical samples, which would hinder our diagnostic product and test development efforts. We could become involved in legal challenges relating to the validity of one or more informed consents from subjects, which could require substantial dedication of time and financial resources.\nIf our clinical studies do not prove that our technologies are superior and demonstrate the clinical utility of our technology, we may never commercialize our product candidates and services.\nThe results of our clinical studies may not show that tests using our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology are superior to existing testing methods and may not demonstrate clinical utility. In that event, we will have to devote significant financial and other resources to further research and development, and commercialization of tests using our technologies will be delayed or may never occur. Our earlier clinical studies were small and included samples from high-risk patients. The results\nfrom these earlier studies may not be representative of the results we may obtain from any future studies, including our next two clinical studies, which will include substantially more samples and a larger percentage of normal-risk patients.\nWe have limited experience in establishing strong business relationships with leading clinical reference laboratories to perform cell-free molecular diagnostic tests using our technologies, which could limit our revenue growth.\nA key step in our strategy is to sell diagnostic products that use our proprietary technologies to leading clinical reference laboratories that will perform cell-free molecular diagnostic tests. We have limited experience in establishing these business relationships. If we are unable to establish and maintain these business relationships, we may not be able to generate revenue beyond the revenue we can generate from our limited in-house test processing capabilities.\nWe depend upon our officers and other key employees, and if we are not able to retain them or recruit additional qualified personnel, the commercialization of our product candidates and any future tests that we develop could be delayed or negatively impacted.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the continued contributions of our officers, especially Dr. Antonius Schuh, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key employees. Our success also depends in part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, commercial and administrative personnel. The specialized nature of our industry results in an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field and, in order to pursue our test development and commercialization strategies, we will need to attract, hire and retain, or engage as consultants, additional personnel with specialized experience in a number of disciplines, including assay development, bioinformatics and statistics, laboratory and clinical operations, clinical affairs and studies, government regulation, sales and marketing, billing and reimbursement and information systems. Additionally, there is intense competition for personnel in the fields in which we operate. If we are unable to attract new employees and retain existing employees, the development and commercialization of our product candidates and any tests we may develop in the future could be delayed or negatively impacted.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe are a small company with 67 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015. Future growth of our company will impose significant additional responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, attract, retain, motivate and integrate highly skilled personnel. We may increase the number of employees in the future depending on the progress of our development of cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize cell-free molecular diagnostic tests and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u2022\nmanage our clinical studies effectively;\n\u2022\nintegrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and regulatory personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u2022\nhire and train additional qualified personnel.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nAll of our diagnostic technology and services are performed at a single laboratory, and in the event this facility is affected by a termination of the lease or a man-made or natural disaster, our operations could be severely impaired.\nWe are performing all of our diagnostic services in our laboratory located in San Diego, California. Despite precautions taken by us, any future natural or man-made disaster at this laboratory, such as a fire, flood, earthquake or terrorist act, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment and urine samples or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nIn addition, we are leasing the facilities where our laboratory operates. We are currently in compliance with all of our lease obligations, but should the lease terminate for any reason, or if the laboratory is moved due to conditions outside of our control, it could cause substantial delay in our diagnostics operations, damage or destroy our equipment and biological samples or cause us to incur additional expenses. In the event of an extended shutdown of our laboratory, we may be unable to perform\nour services in a timely manner or at all and therefore would be unable to operate in a commercially competitive manner. This could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFurther, if we have to use a substitute laboratory while our facility is closed, we could only use another facility with established state licensure and accreditation under CLIA. We may not be able to find another CLIA-certified facility and comply with applicable procedures, or find any such laboratory that would be willing to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, any new laboratory opened by us would be subject to certification under CLIA and licensure by various states, which would take a significant amount of time and expense and result in delays in our ability to continue our personalized medicine services operations.\nSecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and/or our physical buildings could expose us to liability and damage our reputation and business.\nIt is essential to our business strategy that our technology and network infrastructure and our physical buildings remain secure and are perceived by our customers and corporate partners to be secure. Despite security measures, however, any network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers and other security threats. We may face cyber-attacks that attempt to penetrate our network security, sabotage or otherwise disable our research, products and services, misappropriate our or our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 proprietary information, which may include personally identifiable information, or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services. Despite security measures, we also cannot guarantee security of our physical buildings. Physical building penetration or any cyber-attacks could negatively affect our reputation, damage our network infrastructure and our ability to deploy our products and services, harm our relationship with customers and partners that are affected, and expose us to financial liability.\nAdditionally, there are a number of state, federal and international laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, imposes limitations on the use and disclosure of an individual\u2019s healthcare information by healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health insurance plans, or, collectively, covered entities, and also grants individuals rights with respect to their health information. HIPAA also imposes compliance obligations and corresponding penalties for non-compliance on individuals and entities that provide services to healthcare providers and other covered entities. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA were amended. ARRA also made significant increases in the penalties for improper use or disclosure of an individual\u2019s health information under HIPAA and extended enforcement authority to state attorneys general. As amended by ARRA and subsequently by the final omnibus rule adopted in 2013, HIPAA also imposes notification requirements on covered entities in the event that certain health information has been inappropriately accessed or disclosed: notification requirements to individuals, federal regulators, and in some cases, notification to local and national media. Notification is not required under HIPAA if the health information that is improperly used or disclosed is deemed secured in accordance with encryption or other standards developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Most states have laws requiring notification of affected individuals and/or state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by HIPAA. Many state laws impose significant data security requirements, such as encryption or mandatory contractual terms, to ensure ongoing protection of personal information. Activities outside of the U.S. implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws, to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nGeneral economic or business conditions may have a negative impact on our business.\nContinuing concerns over U.S. health care reform legislation and energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and government stimulus programs in the U.S. and other countries have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy. If the economic climate does not improve, or if it deteriorates, our business, including our access to patient samples and the addressable market for tests that we may successfully develop, as well as the financial condition of our suppliers and our third-party payors, could be negatively impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management expects to continue to devote substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. For example, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There is significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact (in ways we cannot currently anticipate) the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations and, as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will continue to cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe may become subject to federal and state tax assessments, penalties and interest with respect to past compensation paid to certain of our executives.\nDuring our internal review process, contingencies were identified regarding various federal and state tax exposures with respect to past compensation paid to certain of our executives. We have not recorded any accrued liabilities related to the potential federal and state tax exposure. If we become subject to any material tax assessment, penalties and interest by federal and state tax authorities in the future, our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our technology will depend largely upon the extent to which third-party payors reimburse our current and future tests.\nPhysicians and patients may decide not to order our products unless third-party payors, such as managed care organizations, as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay a substantial portion of the test price.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that our product candidates are:\n\u2022\nnot experimental or investigational;\n\u2022\neffective;\n\u2022\nmedically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective;\n\u2022\nsupported by peer-reviewed publications; and\n\u2022\nincluded in clinical practice guidelines.\nMarket acceptance, sales of products based upon our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, and our profitability may depend on reimbursement policies and healthcare reform measures. Several entities conduct technology assessments of medical tests and devices and provide the results of their assessments for informational purposes to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payors and healthcare providers as grounds to deny coverage for a test or procedure. The levels at which government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, may reimburse the price patients pay for such products could affect whether we are able to commercialize our product candidates. Our product candidates may receive negative assessments that may impact our ability to receive reimbursement for our current and future tests. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to reimburse a test, seeking these approvals may be a time-consuming and costly process. We cannot be sure that reimbursement\nin the U.S. or elsewhere will be available for any of our product candidates in the future. If reimbursement is not available or is limited, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, if we are unable to obtain reimbursement approval from private payors and Medicare and Medicaid programs for our product candidates, or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate, our ability to generate revenues could be limited. Even if we are able to obtain reimbursement for our tests, insurers may withdraw their coverage policies or cancel their contracts with us at any time, stop paying for our tests or reduce the payment rate for our tests, each of which would reduce our revenue. Moreover, we may depend upon a limited number of third-party payors for a significant portion of our test revenues and if these or other third-party payors stop providing reimbursement or decrease the amount of reimbursement for our tests, our revenues could decline.\nIf we do not receive regulatory approvals, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology.\nWe may need approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to market products based on our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology for diagnostic uses in the U.S. and approvals from foreign regulatory authorities to market products based on our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology outside the U.S. We have not yet filed an application with the FDA to obtain approval to market any of our proposed products. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of products based on our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, we will be unable to sell such product candidates and will not be able to sustain operations.\nWe believe the estimated molecular diagnostics market for many diseases in Europe is approximately as large as that of the U.S. If we seek to market products or services such as a urine-based Human Papillomavirus, or HPV, high-risk, or HR, Detection test in Europe, we will need to receive a CE Mark. If we do not obtain a CE Mark for our urine-based HPV HR Detection test, we will be unable to sell this product candidate in Europe and countries that recognize the CE Mark.\nThe regulatory review and approval process, which may include evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical studies of product candidates based on our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, as well as the evaluation of manufacturing processes and contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Securing regulatory approval for products based on our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology may require the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities to establish such product candidates\u2019 safety and effectiveness for each indication. We have limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals.\nRegulatory authorities generally have substantial discretion in the approval process and may either refuse to accept one or more of our applications or may decide after review of an application that the data submitted is insufficient to allow for approval of any product based upon our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. If regulatory authorities do not accept or approve our applications, they may require that we conduct additional preclinical, clinical or manufacturing studies and submit that data before regulatory authorities will reconsider such application. We may need to expend substantial resources to conduct further studies to obtain data that regulatory authorities believe is sufficient. Depending on the extent of these studies, approval of applications may be delayed by several years or may require us to expend substantially more resources than we had budgeted for such applications. It is also possible that additional studies may not suffice in helping us obtain approval of our applications. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our applications for approval, which may force us to cease or curtail operations.\nIf we do not comply with governmental regulations applicable to our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified laboratory, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThe establishment and operation of our laboratory is subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the U.S. Our laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of compliance and is licensed by every state (other than the State of New York) and the District of Columbia, as required, which enables us to provide testing services to residents of almost every state. Failure to comply with state regulations or changes in state regulatory requirements could result in a substantial curtailment or even prohibition of the operations of our laboratory and could materially adversely affect our business. CLIA is a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. To renew CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make unannounced inspections of these laboratories. If we were to lose our CLIA certification or our state licenses, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation of our license, we would no longer be able to continue our testing operations, which would materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition. Potential sanctions for violations of these statutes and regulations also\ninclude significant fines, the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, or product suspension or recalls.\nIf we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials and chemicals. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition. Moreover, in the event of an accident or if we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could lose our permits or approvals or be held liable for damages or penalized with fines.\nChanges in healthcare policy could subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may delay the commercialization of our tests and increase our costs.\nThe U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of our diagnostic products and tests in the U.S. or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce healthcare costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products and services that we believe are fair, which may impact our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.\nNew laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and judicial decisions, that relate to healthcare availability, methods of delivery or payment for products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenue or force us to revise our research and development programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging due to several reasons, including policies advanced by the current executive administration in the U.S., new healthcare legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nFor example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both government health plans and private insurers. The PPACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations in ways that may negatively affect our revenues in the future. While it is too early to predict all the specific effects the PPACA or any future healthcare reform legislation will have on our business, such provisions could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gives the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical studies of products, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical studies and regulatory review, increased costs to assure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of approved products, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nIf the FDA were to begin regulating laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, or if we decide to market our product candidates as a medical device rather than a LDT, we could be forced to delay commercialization of our current product candidates, experience significant delays in commercializing any future tests, incur substantial costs and time delays associated with meeting requirements for pre-market clearance or approval and/or experience decreased demand for or reimbursement of our test.\nWe intend to develop products that are considered to be medical devices and are subject to federal regulations, including, but not limited to, those covering the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and Medical Device Reporting, or MDR.\nThe QSR includes requirements related to the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for designing, purchasing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing and servicing of medical devices. Manufacturing facilities undergo FDA inspections to assure compliance with the QSR. The quality systems for FDA-regulated products are known as current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, as described in the Code of Federal Regulations, part 820 (21 CFR part 820). Among the cGMP requirements are those requiring manufacturers to have sufficient appropriate personnel to implement required design controls and other portions of the QSR guidelines.\nDesign controls include procedures that describe the product design requirements (design goals) and compare actual output to these requirements, including documented Design Reviews. Required Design History Files, or DHFs, for each device will document the records necessary to demonstrate that the design was developed in accordance with the approved design plan and the requirements of the QSR.\nThe QSR also includes stipulation for control of all documents used in design and production, including history of any changes made. Production and process controls include stipulations to ensure products are in fact produced as specified by controlled documents resulting from the controlled design phase, using products and services purchased under controlled purchasing procedures.\nIncidents in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury must be reported to the FDA under the MDR program. In addition, certain malfunctions must also be reported. The MDR regulation is a mechanism for the FDA and manufacturers to identify and monitor significant adverse events involving medical devices. The goals of the MDR regulation are to detect and correct problems in a timely manner.\nWe are subject to MDR through two routes. As a manufacturer of products for sale within the U.S., we are required to report to the FDA any deaths, serious injuries, malfunctions or events requiring remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health. Our CLIA laboratory, which offers services for sale, is already currently required to report suspected medical device related deaths to both the FDA and the relevant manufacturers of products we purchase and use.\nClinical laboratory tests like our current product offerings are regulated in the U.S. under CLIA as well as by applicable state laws. Diagnostic kits that are sold and distributed through interstate commerce are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. Clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use are called LDTs. Most LDTs currently are not subject to FDA regulation, although reagents or software provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation. We expect that, upon the commencement of commercialization, our product candidates will be an LDT and not a diagnostic kit. As a result, we believe that our product candidates should not be subject to regulation under current FDA policies; however, there is no assurance that our product candidates will not be subject to such regulation in the future. If we decide to market our product candidates as a diagnostic kit rather than as a LDT, our products would be subject to FDA regulation as a medical device. Further, the container we expect to provide for collection and transport of tumor samples from a pathology laboratory to our clinical reference laboratory may be a medical device subject to FDA regulation, and while we expect that it will be exempt from pre-market review by the FDA, there is no certainty in that respect.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review, will not be required in the future for our LDT product candidates, either through new policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. It is possible that legislation that results in increased regulatory burdens for us to offer or continue to offer our product as a clinical laboratory service will be signed into law, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nIf pre-market review is required, our business could be negatively impacted until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained, and the FDA could require that we stop selling our product. If pre-market review of our LDTs is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our product offerings will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations, such as the QSR and MDR, would increase the cost of conducting our business and subject us to inspection by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA pre-market review of our product offerings if we determine that doing so would be appropriate. Some competitors may develop competing tests cleared for marketing by the FDA. There may be a marketing differentiation or perception that an FDA-cleared test is more desirable than our product offerings, and that could discourage adoption and reimbursement of our test.\nWe may be required to conduct clinical studies and we may find it difficult to enroll patients in such clinical studies, which could delay or prevent clinical studies of our product candidates.\nIf the FDA decides to regulate our LDTs, it may require that we conduct extensive pre-market clinical studies prior to submitting a regulatory application for commercial sales. If we are required to conduct pre-market clinical studies, whether using retrospectively collected and banked samples or prospectively collected samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical studies could significantly increase our test development costs and delay commercialization. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by factors such as unforeseen safety issues, lack of effectiveness during clinical trials, inability to monitor patients adequately during or after testing and slower than expected rates of patient recruitment.\nInsufficient patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. We may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical studies, which may increase the cost of the studies. We will also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform the studies properly. If these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or FDA requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical studies may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors could be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our test. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our test or to become profitable.\nIn addition, in the event we are required to conduct clinical trials, it may be very expensive and difficult to design and implement clinical trials due to the rigorous regulatory requirements to which clinical trials are subject. Clinical trials are also time consuming and there is no certainty as to when we may be able to complete the clinical trial process.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic devices entails an inherent risk of product liability and personal injury claims.\nTo date, we have experienced no product liability or personal injury claims, but any such claims arising in the future could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition. Potential product liability or personal injury claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy or limited by other claims under our umbrella insurance policy. Additionally, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that presently in effect, if at all. In the event that we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, such claim could negatively impact our cash flow and materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nSome of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting \u201ckickbacks\u201d and false or fraudulent claims.\nIn addition to FDA marketing restrictions, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the healthcare product and service industry and to regulate billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers. These laws include the Federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices and providers of laboratory services by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers or prescribers of medical devices and laboratory services. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. Interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing and billing practices is constantly evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and therefore could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition. Our failure to comply with applicable laws could result in various adverse consequences which could harm our business, including the exclusion of our products and services from government programs and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests.\nIf our technology were commercially available today, reimbursement would be available under the current procedural terminology, or CPT, codes, for molecular-based testing. The American Medical Association CPT\u00ae Editorial Panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing. The adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payors to better determine tests being performed. This could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials for our product candidates or products we may develop in the future, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies, which would impair our competitive advantage.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, and other contractual restrictions, to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We may not be successful in defending challenges made in connection with our patents and patent applications. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies and they will be able to compete more effectively against us.\nIn addition to our patents, we rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. We require our employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements and our employees are also required to sign agreements assigning to us all intellectual property arising from their work for us. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nOur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents and any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the invention claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications in the U.S., or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions claimed in our foreign issued patents or pending patent applications. In addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the PTO, which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2011, the U.S. enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that would transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In addition, we may become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine our entitlement to patents, and these proceedings may conclude that other patents or patent applications have priority over our patents or patent applications. It is also possible that a competitor may successfully challenge our patents through various proceedings and those challenges may result in the elimination or narrowing of our patents, and therefore reduce our patent protection. Accordingly, rights under any of our issued patents, patent applications or future patents may not provide us with commercially meaningful protection for our products or afford us a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes.\nThe patents issued to us may not be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection, one or more of our competitors may develop more effective technologies, designs or methods without infringing our intellectual property rights and one or more of our competitors may design around our proprietary technologies.\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets and know-how, our competitors may use our inventions to develop competing products. We own certain patents relating to our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. However, these patents may not protect us against our competitors, and patent litigation is very expensive. We may not have sufficient cash available to pursue any patent litigation to its conclusion because we currently do not generate revenues other than licensing, milestone and royalty income.\nWe cannot rely solely on our current patents to be successful. The standards that the PTO and foreign patent offices use to grant patents, and the standards that U.S. and foreign courts use to interpret patents, are not the same, are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. As such, the degree of patent protection obtained in the U.S. may differ substantially from that obtained in various foreign countries. In some instances, patents have been issued in the U.S. while substantially less or no protection has been obtained in Europe or other countries.\nWe cannot be certain of the level of protection, if any, that will be provided by our patents if they are challenged in court, where our competitors may raise defenses such as invalidity, unenforceability or possession of a valid license. In addition, the type and extent of any patent claims that may be issued to us in the future are uncertain. Any patents that are issued may not contain claims that will permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology.\nThird parties may challenge the validity of our patents and other intellectual property rights, resulting in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive proceedings, which could deprive us of valuable rights. If we become involved in any intellectual property litigation, interference or other judicial or administrative proceedings, we will incur substantial expenses and the attention of our technical and management personnel will be diverted. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages, which can be tripled if the infringement is deemed willful, or be required to discontinue or significantly delay development, marketing, selling and licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights. In our European patent that covers using microRNAs to detect in vivo cell death, an anonymous third party has recently filed an opposition against the claims in the patent. Oppositions against the patentability of claims in a European patent are considered by a panel of examiners at the European Patent Office, and we are considering the full range of options available for defending against the opposition.\nOur competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. There may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with our potential products or processes. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies that we are ordered to pay, if any, would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We may also be subject to injunctions against the further development and use of our technology, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could materially adversely affect our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related to disclosure controls and procedures, or if we discover additional material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, which was remedied in the year ended December 31, 2013. We cannot be certain that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives our board of directors the right to create one or more new series of preferred stock. As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and equity interests of the holders of our\ncommon stock. Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock. Without the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not adversely alter or change the rights of the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or increase the number of authorized shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, create a class of stock that is senior to or on parity with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, amend our certificate of incorporation in breach of these provisions or agree to any of the foregoing.\nOur common stock price may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in price, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations over short periods of time. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the closing price of our common stock ranged from a low of $4.21 to a high of $13.58. These fluctuations may be due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations or new products and services introduced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nclinical trial results relating to our tests or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements or press releases relating to the industry or to our own business or prospects;\n\u2022\ncoverage and reimbursement decisions by third party payors, such as Medicare and other managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nregulation and oversight of our product candidates and services, including by the FDA, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and comparable foreign agencies;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of partnerships with clinical reference laboratories;\n\u2022\nhealthcare legislation;\n\u2022\nintellectual property disputes;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate operations, technology, products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u2022\noperating results below expectations;\n\u2022\nloss of any strategic relationship;\n\u2022\nindustry developments;\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, could materially adversely affect the market price of our securities. Because we are a development stage company with no revenue from operations to date, other than licensing, milestone and royalty income, you should consider any one of these factors to be material. Our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the foregoing.\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 33.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and growth. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Payment of dividends would depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors that our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. In addition, under the terms of our Loan and Security Agreement and the Equipment Line of Credit, we are precluded from paying cash dividends without the prior written consent of the Lenders, and the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock prohibit us from paying dividends to the holders of our common stock so long as any dividends due on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock remain unpaid. Investors in our common stock should not rely on an investment in our company if they require dividend income.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nDelaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences and rights of each series without stockholder approval. The ability to issue preferred stock could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our company, or otherwise could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. This provision may prohibit or restrict large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us, which could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in our market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market and could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of investors interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. Finance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly issued shares that become readily tradable, or\nother events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders may sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe may be subject to stockholder litigation, thereby diverting our resources, which could materially adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility, and we expect that our share price will continue to be at least as volatile for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price for its securities. In addition, stockholders may bring actions against companies relating to past transactions or other matters. Any such actions could give rise to substantial damages and thereby materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Even if an action is not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with stockholder actions could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition. Litigation can be costly, time-consuming and disruptive to business operations. The defense of lawsuits could also result in diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 13411, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CRDF"}
