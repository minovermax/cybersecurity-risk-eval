{"cik": "1372299", "company": "HISTOGENICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as all the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. In that event the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives\nOur exploration and pursuit of strategic alternatives may not be successful.\nBased on the results of our Phase 3 clinical study of NeoCart and feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) regarding a potential Biologics License Application (BLA) submission, we determined to cease all further development of NeoCart and implemented operating cost reductions and organizational restructurings, including recent reductions in our workforce, to preserve our cash resources and better align our organization with our current operating plan. Our strategic focus has shifted to the identification and evaluation of a range of potential strategic alternatives designed to maximize stockholder value. We have retained Canaccord Genuity LLC to advise and assist us in this review, along with legal advisors. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this process include the potential for an acquisition, merger, business combination, licensing and/or other strategic transaction involving Histogenics. Despite devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions, the process may not result in any definitive offer to consummate a strategic transaction, or, if we receive such a definitive offer, the terms may not be as favorable as anticipated or may not result in the execution or approval of a definitive agreement. Even if we enter into a definitive agreement, we may not be successful in completing a transaction or, if we complete such a transaction, it may not enhance stockholder value or deliver expected benefits.\nIf we do not successfully consummate a strategic transaction, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a liquidation and dissolution of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the process to identify a strategic transaction will result in a successfully consummated transaction. If a transaction is not completed, our Board of Directors (the Board) may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company, which may be done under the protection of the bankruptcy laws or under Delaware state dissolution laws. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our operations while we evaluate our strategic alternatives. In addition, if our Board were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provisions for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include: (i) regulatory and clinical obligations remaining under our Phase 3 clinical trial for NeoCart; (ii) payment of our lease obligations in the normal course of business or negotiated one-time termination fees in the event we determine that a wind-up of operations is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders; (iii) obligations under our employment and related agreements with certain employees that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of our Company; (iv) payments made related to potential investigations or litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business; and (v) payment of liabilities generated from our business operations. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a liquidation and dissolution of our Company. If a liquidation and dissolution were pursued, our Board, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to\nreserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock and other securities could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company.\nIf we are successful in completing a strategic transaction, we may be exposed to other operational and financial risks.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that a strategic transaction will result from the process we have undertaken to identify and evaluate strategic alternatives, the negotiation and consummation of any such transaction will require significant time on the part of our management, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention may disrupt our business. The negotiation and consummation of any such transaction may also require more time or greater cash resources than we anticipate and expose us to other operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased near-term and long-term expenditures;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected transaction or integration costs;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund future operations;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or incurrence of non-recurring, impairment or other charges;\n\u2022\nadditional severance costs and retention payments;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership; or\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of our company or any acquired business.\nAny of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nFollowing our recent reductions in force, we may not have resources or the required expertise to enable a potential strategic partner to develop NeoCart, which may impair its value.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business and the unique properties of NeoCart, our ability to preserve the option to resume NeoCart development is highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel, consultants and advisors. Some of the potential strategic partners with whom we are evaluating a transaction place a high value on the NeoCart development program overall and the ability to resume NeoCart development activities. However, our ongoing restructuring efforts resulted in the elimination of all of our research and development, clinical operations and manufacturing staff. The loss of their services will significantly delay or prevent any resumption of the research and development of NeoCart should a strategic partner choose to resume those activities in the future.\nShould a partner need to recruit additional personnel in order to resume research and development activities, such partner would need to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, government regulation, manufacturing, marketing and sales, which may place a strain on its managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. Historically, we have also relied on consultants and advisors to assist in formulating our research and development strategy and adhering to complex regulatory requirements and a potential strategic partner may need to re-engage some of those consultants and advisors should such partner want to resume the development of NeoCart. There is significant competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. There can be no assurance that a strategic partner will be able to attract and retain such individuals in the future, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, consultants and advisors could delay or prevent a partner\u2019s ability to commercialize NeoCart, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to consummate a transaction with such partner.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced corporate restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities may adversely affect our ability to consummate a strategic transaction that enhances stockholder value.\nIn order to better align our resources with our operational needs going forward and based on the results of our Phase 3 clinical study of NeoCart and feedback from the FDA regarding a potential BLA submission, we reduced our workforce in January 2019 and again in March 2019 leaving one remaining employee as of the end of March 2019. As part of this corporate restructuring and our focus on the identification and evaluation of strategic alternatives, we also discontinued our research activities and focused on the completion and close-out of any ongoing clinical trial activities. While we intend to engage our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Operating Officer and up to four additional employees as consultants to assist with our continuing evaluation of strategic alternatives, these reductions in force resulted in the loss of numerous long-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, and the reallocation of certain job responsibilities, all of which could negatively affect operational efficiencies and increase our operating expenses such that we may not fully realize anticipated savings from the restructuring, and could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nWe are substantially dependent on our remaining employee and consultants to facilitate the consummation of a strategic transaction.\nIn connection with our restructuring in January 2019 and a further restructuring in March of 2019, we terminated all but one employee. Our ability to successfully complete a strategic transaction depends in large part on our ability to retain the consulting services of certain of our former personnel, particularly Adam Gridley, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Lieber, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, and Stephen Kennedy, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Despite our efforts to retain these individuals as consultants following their separation of service from the Company, one or more may terminate their engagement with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could potentially harm our ability to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, as well as fulfill our reporting obligations as a public company.\nWe may not realize any additional value in a strategic transaction for our intellectual property.\nThe market capitalization of our company is or may be below the value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Although our most advanced product candidate, NeoCart, failed to meet its primary endpoint, we believe that data from preclinical and clinical studies of NeoCart support potential further investigation and development of NeoCart and our underlying proprietary intellectual property relating to scaffolds and CT3. However, potential counterparties in a strategic transaction involving our Company may place minimal or no value on these assets, given the limited data regarding their potential application. Further, the development and any potential commercialization of NeoCart will require substantial additional funding associated with conducting the necessary clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval. Consequently, any potential counterparty in a strategic transaction involving our company may choose not to spend additional resources and continue development of NeoCart and may attribute little or no value, in such a transaction, to NeoCart or our other intellectual property.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm the company\u2019s business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, or the announcement of negative events, such as negative results from clinical trials. These events may also result in investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may be exposed to such litigation or investigation even if no wrongdoing occurred. Litigation and investigations are usually expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and cash resources and our ability to consummate a potential strategic transaction or the ultimate value our stockholders receive in any such transaction.\nAlthough we have ceased all further development of NeoCart and our other potential product candidates, if we were to resume research and development activities, we would require substantial additional funding. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or to a product candidate.\nWe currently do not have any external source of funds and do not expect to generate any revenue. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements under our current operating plan, which is to seek a strategic alternative to maximize stockholder value, and into the middle of 2019. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect if our operating plans change. If our current operating plans change and we determine to pursue further research and development activities, we will require substantial additional funding to operate, and would expect to finance these cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding and licensing or collaboration arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any equity or convertible debt we agree to issue may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Convertible debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, and declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to further curtail or cease our operations or we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, any future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nRisks Related to Our Historical Business\nThe FDA has indicated an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for NeoCart would be required before the FDA would consider accepting a BLA submission for NeoCart.\nOn December 20, 2018, we had a telephonic meeting with senior members of the FDA. Based on the feedback received from the FDA, while the NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial resulted in certain compelling data, the FDA indicated that an additional Phase 3 clinical trial would need to be completed before it would accept a submission of a BLA for NeoCart. The FDA indicated receptivity to novel clinical trial methodologies and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designations in order to support additional data for a future potential submission. However, considering the time and funding required to conduct such a trial, we discontinued the development of NeoCart and do not plan to submit a BLA.\nWe have historically been a clinical-stage cell therapy company with a limited operating history of developing late-stage product candidates. There is a limited amount of information about us upon which to evaluate our product candidates and business prospects, making an investment in our common stock unsuitable for many investors.\nWe have historically been a clinical-stage company focused on the development of restorative cell therapies (RCTs). We use the term RCT to refer to a new class of products we are developing that are designed to offer patients rapid-onset pain relief and restored function through the repair of damaged or worn tissue. We were formed in 2000 and have a limited operating history. Since inception we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of our cell therapy technology platform, the clinical and preclinical advancement of our product candidates, the creation, licensing and protection of related intellectual property rights and the provision of general and administrative support for these operations. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any product candidates in any jurisdiction or generated any significant revenues from product sales. We have discontinued our development of NeoCart and we are currently evaluating strategic alternatives, as described elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses for the next several years.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $8.6 million in 2018 and $26.4 million in 2017. As of December 31, 2018 we had an accumulated deficit of $216.8 million. We anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations into the the middle of 2019. Accordingly, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the amount and timing of our expenses. These net losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $67 million and $67 million, respectively, which may be utilized against future federal and state income taxes. In general, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders, generally stockholders beneficially owning five percent or more of our common stock, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules, increases by more than 50% over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, generally three years. Purchases of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels, which will be beyond our control, could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. In addition, the closing of a strategic transaction may result in the limitation of our NOLs, which may affect the value we receive in such a strategic transaction. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause us to pay U.S. federal and state income taxes earlier than we would otherwise be required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire beginning in 2037. In addition, at the state level there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which would accelerate or may permanently increase state taxes owed. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under existing agreements pursuant to which we license rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business and as a result possibly material to a potential strategic partner.\nWe are a party to several technology licenses that are important to our business including material licenses from Purpose Co., Ltd., Angiotech Pharmaceuticals (US), Inc. and Angiodevice International GmbH. The rights licensed under these agreements, including rights relating to our tissue processor and bioadhesives are material to our cell therapy technology platform and the continued development of NeoCart and any future product candidates a strategic partner may choose to develop. These licenses impose various commercial, contingent payment, royalty, insurance, indemnification and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would lose valuable rights under our license agreements and the ability to develop or commercialize product candidates. Any termination or reversion of our rights to under the foregoing agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations and could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nWe may face product liability claims and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use of our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nThe use of NeoCart in clinical trials exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by participants in clinical trials, consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product candidates and any products for which we obtain marketing approval. There is a risk that NeoCart could result in future adverse events in patients who were previously treated, and that such adverse events may not be detected for a long period of time. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, and if we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nincreased costs due to related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\n\u2022\npotential impairment of our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction.\nWe carry product liability insurance that we believe is sufficient in light of our historical clinical programs; however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on cell or tissue therapies or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. In addition, under some of our agreements with clinical trial sites, we were required to indemnify the sites and their personnel against product liability and other claims. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us or any third parties whom we are required to indemnify could cause our stock price to decline further and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter and we may not be able to receive or maintain insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nChanges in government funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, properly administer drug innovation, or prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized by our life science tenants, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels, government closures or shutdowns, the ability to hire and retain key personnel, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Budgetary pressures and or the closure of the federal government may result in a reduced ability by the FDA to perform its role. Specifically, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could delay the ability of a prospective strategic partner to discuss any potential regulatory path forward for NeoCart and as a result delay a potential strategic transaction.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States and abroad may make it more difficult and costly for a future partner to obtain regulatory approval of NeoCart and to produce, market and distribute NeoCart if an approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect NeoCart or any other products that a strategic partner may choose to develop. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of NeoCart or any future product candidates. Recent presidential and congressional elections in the U.S. could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care industry. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u2022\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022\nadditional studies, including clinical studies;\n\u2022\nrecall, replacement, or discontinuance of NeoCart;\n\u2022\nthe payment of additional taxes; or\n\u2022\nadditional record keeping.\nEach of these requirements would likely entail substantial time and cost and could adversely harm the future prospects for our business and our financial results which could impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements.\nOur management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls relating to the accounting for transactions that are either highly complex and/or unusual in nature. In such instances, we seek to augment our internal accounting capabilities by obtaining assistance from third-parties who have greater expertise in such areas. Examples of situations such as these include (but are not limited to) the determination of the initial and periodic fair value of warrants that are liability classified and the accounting treatment for the termination of the Company\u2019s collaboration agreement with Intrexon Corporation (\u201cIntrexon\u201d). For example, during the third quarter of 2018, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls relating to the valuation of the warrant liability. Because the valuation of the warrants is exceedingly complex and requires highly specialized skills to perform and review, we use the assistance of a third-party service provider to perform such valuation. In the third quarter of 2018, the third-party service provider made an error in the valuation that was not detected by management in its review process but was identified by our independent registered public accounting firm. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to the accounting treatment for the contingent liability associated with the termination agreement entered into with Intrexon which terminated the Company\u2019s collaboration agreement with Intrexon. In this instance, we concluded after numerous discussions with our independent registered public accounting firm that we had incorrectly accounted for the contingent liability. In both cases these items were discovered prior to the issuance of the financial statements. The identified material weakness did not result in a misstatement to our consolidated financial statements or disclosures; however, it could result in misstatements of certain account balances (such as warrant liability, change in fair value of warrant liability and accrued expenses due to Intrexon) or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We have implemented additional review procedures, including engaging a second third-party service provider to assist in our review of the work of the third-party service provider preparing the warrant valuation analysis and will seek to implement a similar procedure for other unusual or complex transactions going forward.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not have additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify any other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements. These could result in a material decline in our stock price and could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our development partners, third-party clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our development partners, third-party clinical research organizations, data management organizations and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of any NeoCart clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development NeoCart or any future product candidates could be delayed.\nWe rely on email and other messaging services in connection with our operations. We may be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoofing and phishing emails to misappropriate passwords, payment information or other personal information or to introduce viruses through Trojan horse programs or otherwise through our networks, computers, smartphones, tablets or other devices. Despite our efforts to mitigate the effectiveness of such malicious email campaigns through a variety of control and non-electronic checks, spoofing and phishing may damage our business and increase our costs. We do not currently maintain a cyber insurance policy. Any of these events or circumstances could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nWe use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly. We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations.\nOur research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our research, development and production efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced.\nOur employees or consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee and consultant fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees or consultants could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA or foreign regulators, failure to provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, failure to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, failure to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, failure to report financial information or data accurately, and failure to comply with our own internal company policies. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee or consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIn addition, during the course of our operations our directors, executives, employees and consultants may have access to material, nonpublic information regarding our business, our results of operations or potential transactions we are considering. We may not be able to prevent a director, executive, employee or consultant from trading in our common stock on the basis of, or while having access to, material, nonpublic information. If a director, executive, employee or consultant was to be investigated or an action was to be brought against a director, executive, employee or consultant for insider trading, it could have a negative impact on our reputation and our stock price. Such a claim, with or without merit, could also result in substantial expenditures of time and money and divert attention of our management team from other tasks important to the success of our business.\nCosts associated with being a public reporting company are significant, and public reporting requirements divert significant company resources and management attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the other rules and regulations of the SEC. Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public reporting companies requires considerable time, attention of management and financial resources and we will need to maintain such compliance in order to complete certain of the strategic alternatives currently under evaluation by our Board.\nFurther, the listing requirements of Nasdaq require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism. If any of our manufacturing, processing or storage facilities are damaged or destroyed, our business and prospects would be adversely affected.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, or a significant power outage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of our manufacturing, processing or storage facilities, or any of the equipment in such facilities were to be damaged or destroyed, it may result a lack of any definitive offer to consummate a strategic transaction, or, if we receive such a definitive offer, the terms may not be as favorable as anticipated or may not result in the consummation of a transaction.\nWe have historically produced materials for our clinical trials at our manufacturing facilities located in Waltham, Massachusetts, and produced our critical raw materials for use in NeoCart production in our facilities located in Lexington, Massachusetts. If these facilities or the equipment in them are significantly damaged or destroyed, a strategic partner may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace such manufacturing capacity. In addition, natural disasters could affect our third-party service providers\u2019 and manufacturers ability to perform services and provide materials for us or a strategic partner on a timely basis. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to complete a strategic transaction may be impeded. For example, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our third-party service providers, partners, customers or the economy as a whole which could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. Our computer systems may be vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Security breaches pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, clinical data, trade secrets or personal information may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our key business partners face similar risks, and a security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. While we continue to invest data protection and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information or the illegal transfer of funds to unknown persons, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm. Any of these issues could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violation by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these\nlaws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to execute a strategic transaction may depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur ability to execute a strategic transaction may depend in part on our ability to maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that our patent applications or those of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around, or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to these product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and ability to consummate a transaction.\nComposition-of-matter patents are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for a use that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\n\u2022\nPatent applications may not result in any patents being issued.\n\u2022\nPatents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage.\n\u2022\nOur competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our potential product candidates.\n\u2022\nThere may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns.\n\u2022\nCountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop, and market competing product candidates.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nIf we or any of our future development or collaborative partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability and the ability of our current or future development or collaborative partners to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates, some of which may contain claims that overlap with the subject matter of our intellectual property or are directed at our product candidates, technologies or methods of manufacture. When we become aware of patents held by third parties that may implicate the manufacture, development or commercialization of our product candidates, we evaluate our need to license rights to such patents. If we need to license rights from third parties to manufacture, develop or commercialize our product candidates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all could impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents upon which our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we are not aware.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biologics industry generally. If a third-party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or development partners infringe upon a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n\u2022\nseek to obtain licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nabandon an infringing product candidate or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages including, in an exceptional case, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or proprietary technology at issue infringes upon or violates the third-party\u2019s rights;\n\u2022\npay substantial royalties or fees or grant cross-licenses to our technology; or\n\u2022\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nThird parties may infringe upon our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties\nassociated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nIn addition, any future patent litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us, or any of our future development partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all could impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nOur issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court which could have a material adverse effect on our business could impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction.\nIf we or any of our future development partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates or one of our future product candidates, technologies or methods of manufacture, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non- enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business and could impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers to us, which could subject us to costly litigation.\nAs is common in the biotechnology industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at, or may have previously or may be currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team and could impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, which could materially impair our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, Congress recently passed patent reform legislation. The Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world which could materially, negatively affect our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license and may adversely affect our business and could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe received deficiency letters in October 2018 and December 2018 from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). If we were to fail to regain compliance, our shares could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on our market price. A delisting could limit our strategic alternatives and ability to consummate a potential transaction.\nOn October 17, 2018, we received a deficiency letter from the Staff notifying us that, for the 30 consecutive business days prior to October 17, 2018, the closing bid price for our common stock had closed below a minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (Rule 5550(a)(2)). The Nasdaq deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cHSGX\u201d at this time.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been given 180 calendar days, or until April 15, 2019 to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2). If we choose to implement a reverse stock split, we must complete the split no later than ten business days prior to April 15, 2019 to regain compliance. If at any time before April 15, 2019, the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive\nbusiness days (an Automatic Compliance Event), the Staff will provide written confirmation that we have achieved compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2).\nIf we do not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) by April 15, 2019, we may be afforded a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, except for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, we would be required to notify Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, which may include, if necessary, implementing a reverse stock split.\nIf we do not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) by April 15, 2019, and we are not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the Staff will provide notice to us that our securities will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the Staff\u2019s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (Panel). We would remain listed pending the Panel\u2019s decision.\nFurther, on December 19, 2018, we received a deficiency letter from the Staff notifying us that for the last 30 consecutive business days prior to December 18, 2018, the market value of our listed securities were less than $35 million, which does not meet the requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (Rule 5550(b)(2)). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), Nasdaq has provided us with 180 calendar days, or until June 17, 2019, to regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(2). If we regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(2), Nasdaq will provide written confirmation to us and close the matter. If we do not regain compliance with this requirement by June 17, 2019, we will receive written notification from the Staff that our securities are subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearing Panel.\nThe December 2018 deficiency letter did not result in the delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. To regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(2), the market value of our listed securities must meet or exceed $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180-day grace period ending on or before June 17, 2019 (Nasdaq has the discretion to monitor compliance for as long as 20 consecutive business days before deeming us in compliance). We could also regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s alternative continued listing requirements by having stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million or more, or net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year.\nA delisting would also likely make it more difficult for us to obtain financing through the sale of our equity. Any such sale of equity would likely be more dilutive to our current stockholders than would be the case if our shares were listed.\nWe may not satisfy The Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s other requirements for continued listing. If we cannot satisfy these requirements, Nasdaq could delist our common stock and could limit our strategic alternatives and ability to consummate a potential transaction.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cHSGX\u201d. To continue to be listed on Nasdaq, we are required to satisfy a number of conditions. Other than the deficiency letter discussed in the immediately prior risk factor, we previously received two letters from Nasdaq, with the first letter in November 2016 notifying us of our failure to maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of $50,000,000 for the 30 consecutive business days. We subsequently regained compliance with this listing standard in March 2017. The second letter in May 2017 notified us of our failure to maintain a minimum of $10,000,000 in stockholders\u2019 equity as required for companies trading on The Nasdaq Global Market. In response to the second letter, we transferred our securities to The Nasdaq Capital Market in June 2017 to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the Nasdaq listing requirements in the future. If we are delisted from Nasdaq, trading in our shares of common stock may be conducted, if available, on the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board Service\u201d or, if available, via another market. In the event of such delisting, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of the shares of our common stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of the shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could be severely limited. A determination could also then be made that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading. This could have a long-term impact on our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, and you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. The realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors or other unforeseen risks could have a dramatic and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and others such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate a strategic transaction, the value of such transaction including whether it is deemed to enhance stockholder value or deliver expected benefits;\n\u2022\nannouncements about us or about our competitors including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, or new product candidate introductions and the revenue and growth potential of such new products;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our current or future development partners, licensors or product candidate manufacturers;\n\u2022\nlitigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries, regulations or concerns related to cell and gene therapies, and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation and legislation;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of members of our Board, management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u2022\nany changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections, or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nany change in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of market standoff or contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or resulting from inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares.\nIn recent months and years, the stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations. In addition, Brexit or actions taken by the current presidential administration and Congress could adversely affect United States, European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability and volatility in global financial markets. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe expect our quarterly operating results to be subject to fluctuations. Our net income or loss and other operating results may be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to execute on a strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nderivative instruments recorded at fair value, including but not limited to the change in fair value of warrants issued in connection with a private placement we completed in 2016 and warrants issued in our 2018 public offering;\n\u2022\nasset impairments, severance costs, lease termination costs, transaction and other costs triggered by a wind down of our operations; and\n\u2022\nany lawsuits in which we may become involved.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe expect our stock price to continue to be volatile, and securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility of their stock price or after the announcement of a change in control transaction. Any such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. This litigation, if instituted against us could also impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research, publish unfavorable research about our business or cease coverage of our company, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities and industry analysts publish about us or our business. In the event one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes unfavorable research about our business, or if our clinical trials or operating results fail to meet the analysts\u2019 expectations, our stock price would likely decline. Recently, several securities analysts ceased coverage of our company, and if one or more of the remaining analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. Any future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future or at all. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which you have purchased it.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company and the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards and reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We plan to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation on our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s\nreport providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). If we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies.\nInvestors could find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions, which may make it more difficult for investors to compare our business with other companies in our industry. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it.
