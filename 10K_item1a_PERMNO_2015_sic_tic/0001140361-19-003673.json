In addition to the other discussions in this report, particularly those under the headings \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d below and \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above, the following factors should be considered:\n\u00b7\nOur recent restructurings may not be as effective as we anticipated and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings.\nFrom 2014-2017, the Company executed a restructuring plan aimed at eliminating underperforming operations, consolidating manufacturing facilities, and improving efficiencies within the Company. These activities required the devotion of significant resources and management attention and may pose significant risks. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to effectively reduce overhead, rationalize manufacturing capacity, and effectively produce products at the consolidated facilities. Furthermore, our restructurings may not be as effective as we anticipated, and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expected from these restructurings.\nIndex\n\u00b7\nThe impact of currency exchange rate fluctuation may negatively affect our results.\nWe report the results of our foreign operations in the applicable local currency and then translate those results into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. The applicable exchange rates between and among foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future. These fluctuations have impacted our results of operations in recent periods as discussed below in more detail under the headings \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\u201d Such currency exchange rate volatility may also adversely impact our financial condition or liquidity. While we may use forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk, such risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7\nChanges to LIBOR may negatively impact us.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We have used LIBOR as a reference rate in our revolving loans, term loans, asset securitization program, and uncommitted credit facilities such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to these loans is calculated using LIBOR.\nLIBOR, in its current form, is currently scheduled to disappear in 2021. Before LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with a new standard, which has yet to be established. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which is approximately 40-45% of our total debt. While our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements, we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating results.\n\u00b7\nIn some product lines, most of our sales are made to a relatively small number of customers; if we lose any of those customers, sales and operating results could decline.\nIn some of our product lines, our sales are concentrated to a small number of customers. While we do not currently have any single customer that we consider to be significant to us as a whole, the loss of a significant customer for a particular product line could substantially affect the sales and profitability of that line or the business unit that sells that product line, which may cause us to re-evaluate that line. Those developments could affect our results. In addition, the financial condition of our customers may adversely affect their ability to buy from us, or to pay for products that they have already purchased.\n\u00b7\nMany of our products are used in items for human consumption and contact. We may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our profitability and corporate image.\nWe sell flavors, fragrances, and colors that are used in foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and other items for human consumption or contact. These products involve risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, product defects, and other adulteration. We may be subject to liability if the consumption or use of our products cause product damage, injury, illness, or death. In addition, we or our customers may need to recall products in the event of contamination or product defects.\nA significant product defect, product recall, or product liability judgment may negatively impact our profitability for a period of time depending on publicity, product availability, scope, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness, injury, or death could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate image.\n\u00b7\nConsolidation has resulted in customers with increased buying power, which can affect our profitability.\nMany of our customers have consolidated in recent years and we expect the combination trend to continue in many business lines. These consolidations have often produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases. If the larger size or greater buying power of those customers results in additional negotiating strength, the prices we are able to charge could be negatively affected and our profitability could decline.\nIndex\n\u00b7\nIntense competition may result in reduced sales and profitability.\nThe industries and markets in which we operate are highly competitive. That competition can reduce both our sales and the prices at which we are able to sell our products, which can negatively affect our profitability.\n\u00b7\nOur sales and profitability are affected by changing consumer preferences, changing technologies, and our customers\u2019 ability to make and sell to consumers in highly competitive markets.\nAlthough we do not generally make or sell proprietary consumer products, many of our products are sold to companies that develop and market consumer products. Sales of flavors, fragrances, colors, inks, cosmetic ingredients, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical excipients and ingredients, and many of our other products depend in part upon our customers\u2019 ability to create and sell products to consumers in highly competitive markets, all of which are beyond our control. Our sales could also be affected by changing technologies that could impact consumer demand for products that contain our products. Therefore, we depend upon our customers\u2019 ability to create markets for the consumer products that incorporate the products that we manufacture. In addition, if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to the needs of our customers as they evolve in response to changing consumer preferences and new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7\nIf we do not maintain an efficient cost structure, our profitability could decrease.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain an efficient cost structure. We regularly initiate cost-reduction measures that could impact our manufacturing, sales, operations, and information systems functions. If we do not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, or we do not successfully implement related strategies, our competitiveness and our profits could decrease.\n\u00b7\nCommodity, energy, and transportation price volatility and increases or material shortages may reduce our profits.\nWe use many different commodities as raw ingredients. We also use raw materials whose production is energy intensive. In addition, various energy sources are used in our production and distribution processes. Commodity and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuation, production and transportation disruption, world events, and changes in governmental regulations. Commodity and energy price increases will raise both our raw material costs and operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. Increasing our prices also may reduce sales volume and related profitability.\nIn addition, we obtain some raw materials from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Problems with those suppliers could affect the availability of those materials. Even if there are multiple suppliers of a particular raw material, there are occasionally shortages. An unavailability or shortage of a raw material could negatively affect our operations using that raw material and thus adversely affect our results.\n\u00b7\nThere are an enormous number of laws and regulations applicable to us, our suppliers, and our customers across all of our business lines. Compliance with these legal requirements is costly to us and can affect our operations as well as those of our suppliers and customers. Failure to comply could also be costly and disruptive.\nOur facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations relating to the environment, health, safety, and the content, processing, packaging, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food, drugs, cosmetics, other consumer products, specialty inks, and industrial colors. These laws and regulations are administered in the United States by the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor, and other federal and state governmental agencies. We, our suppliers, and our customers are subject to similar governmental regulation and oversight abroad. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be complex and costly and affect our, our suppliers\u2019 and our customers\u2019 operations. Also, if we, our suppliers, or our customers, fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil and criminal remedies, fines, and recalls of products. Regulatory action against a supplier or customer can create risk for us and negatively affect our operations.\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental compliance may be costly to us.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and stringent laws and regulations which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment, handling of materials, and disposition of wastes and air emissions. These rules operate or will operate at both the federal and state levels in the United States, and there are analogous laws at most of our overseas locations. Environmental regulations, and the potential failure to comply with them, can have serious consequences, including the costs of compliance and defense; interference with our operations or the ability to obtain required permits; civil, criminal, and administrative penalties; and negative publicity.\nIndex\n\u00b7\nOperating in foreign countries and emerging markets exposes us to increased risks, including economic, political, and international operation risks.\nWe operate, manufacture, and sell our products and obtain raw materials in many foreign countries and emerging markets. This subjects us to risks that could materially impact our operating results, including: difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel in diverse cultures; transportation delays or interruptions; sometimes unpredictable regulatory changes; and the effects of international political developments and political and economic instability. In addition, changes in policies by the United States or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs, trade regulations, taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers. For example, changes in the trade relationship between the U.S. and China as well as potential regulatory actions by the Chinese government may affect the cost of our raw materials and products originating in China, the demand for as well as the supply of our products manufactured in China or containing raw materials from China, and the demand from Chinese customers for our products.\n\u00b7\nBrexit may adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenue and profits in the short term and long term.\nIn 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The British government and the European Union are negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the European Union. The final terms of the relationship and its impacts on the Company remain unclear. The U.K.\u2019s pending exit from the European Union, currently scheduled for March 29, 2019, has resulted in currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. Because the Company has production facilities, customers, and suppliers in the U.K., the final terms of the agreement on the U.K.\u2019s break with the European Union, or the absence of such an agreement, could have a significant impact on the Company.\nThe Company has revenue related to sales of products between the U.K. and the European Union or its trade agreement partners, and costs related to raw materials purchases between the U.K. and the European Union or its trade agreement partners.\nAny agreement, or the absence of an agreement related to Brexit, could result in an increase in tariffs on all raw materials and finished goods moving between the U.K. and the European Union. Similarly, any agreement, or the absence of an agreement, could result in the U.K. losing the benefit of existing trade agreements between the European Union and other non-European Union countries, thereby increasing tariffs on all raw materials and finished goods moving between the U.K. and those non-European Union countries. An increase in tariffs could increase the cost to produce and sell the Company\u2019s products, reduce the supply of and demand for the Company\u2019s products, and reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and profit. In both the short and long term, increased costs could make the Company less competitive with companies not impacted by post-Brexit tariffs and, given the nature of our industry, could result in the short term and long term loss of customers that choose to introduce new products or reformulate existing products with our lower-cost competitors.\nA new border between the U.K. and the European Union could also impose increased cost, complexity, and delays (perhaps lengthy, particularly in the second and third quarters of 2019) related to the shipping and transportation of raw materials and finished products into and out of the U.K. These delays will complicate the Company\u2019s production and distribution planning and, like increased tariffs, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profit, supply and demand for the Company\u2019s products, and customer retention and acquisition in both the long term and short term.\nAdditionally, post-Brexit, new chemical regulations could be imposed within the U.K. to replace existing European Union regulations such as REACH. Similarly, because the U.K. will no longer be part of the European Union, the Company may be subject to new REACH registration requirements for products produced in the U.K. The costs related to compliance with these regulatory changes could affect the Company\u2019s costs, revenue, profit, supply of and demand for the Company\u2019s products, and the acquisition and retention of customers.\nNext, there could be new restrictions on travel and immigration that result from Brexit that could impose additional costs on the Company. In each of the Company\u2019s three U.K. production facilities, a significant portion of the work forces are not U.K. nationals. Complying with new immigration regimes could result in increased costs to the Company.\nFinally, while the Company will take steps to mitigate the effects of Brexit, these efforts may not be as successful as intended and the Company may not be able to avoid the costs and complications described above.\nIndex\n\u00b7\nWe depend on certain key personnel, and the loss of these persons may harm our business.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued service and availability of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract and retain qualified new personnel. The competition for these individuals can be significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business. In addition, we need to provide for smooth transitions when replacing key management and technical personnel positions. Our operations and results may be negatively affected if we are not able to do so.\n\u00b7\nWe may not successfully complete and integrate past and future acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have acquired many companies and operations in the past and may continue growth by acquisition in the future. Our future growth through acquisitions could involve significant risks that may have a material adverse effect on us. We may also be at risk for factors associated with acquisitions that the Company has made in the past. Acquired companies may also have significant latent liabilities that may not be discovered before an acquisition or fully reflected in the price we pay.\nWe may also need to finance future acquisitions, and the terms of any financing, and the need to ultimately repay or refinance any indebtedness, may have negative effects on us. Acquisitions also could have a dilutive effect on our financial results. Acquisitions also generally result in goodwill, which would need to be written off against earnings in the future if it becomes impaired.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to successfully maintain and upgrade our information technology systems, and to effectively respond to failures, disruptions, compromises, or breaches of our information technology systems, may affect our competitiveness and our profits could decrease.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain a current information technology platform for our businesses to operate effectively, reliably, and securely. We routinely review and upgrade our information technology and cybersecurity systems in order to better manage, report, and protect the information related to our formulas, research and development, manufacturing processes, trade secrets, sales, products, customers, personnel, and other operations. If we do not continue to maintain our information technology and cybersecurity platforms and successfully implement upgrades to systems to protect our vital information, our competitiveness and profits could decrease. Because of the nature of our business, and the importance of our proprietary information, we face threats not only from hackers\u2019 intent on theft and disruption, but also from malicious insiders that may attempt to steal Company information. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be susceptible to failures, disruptions, breaches, theft, and other similar cybersecurity events. The impact of any such event and the effectiveness of our response thereto may adversely affect our operations and subject us to increased operating costs, regulatory consequences, and reputational harm. While we take substantial steps to protect our information and systems through cyber security systems, monitoring, auditing, and training, these efforts may not always be successful.\n\u00b7\nWorld events and natural disasters are beyond our control and could affect our results.\nWorld events can adversely affect national, international, and local economies. Economies can also be affected by conflicts, natural disasters, epidemics, or other catastrophic events. Such events and conditions, as well as uncertainty in or impairment of financial markets, have adversely affected and could continue to affect our revenues and profitability, particularly if they occur in locations in which we or our customers have significant operations. In addition, while we have manufacturing facilities throughout the world, certain of our facilities are the sole manufacturer of a specific product and a disruption in manufacturing could lead to increased costs of relocating or replacing the production of a product, or reformulating a product, which could have an adverse effect on our results.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to efficiently manage inventory may not be as effective as we anticipate and may adversely impact our performance.\nEfficient inventory management is essential to our performance. We must maintain appropriate inventory levels and product mix to meet customer demand, without incurring costs related to storing and holding excess inventory. If our inventory management decisions do not accurately predict demand or otherwise result in excess inventory, our financial results may be adversely impacted by markdowns, impairment charges, or other costs related to disposal of excess or obsolete inventory.\n\u00b7\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other countries where we operate. While the Company maintains robust policies to prevent violations of these laws and to monitor third party risks, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws is expensive and could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. Under these laws companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by their directors, officers, employees, agents, or other representatives. We could be subject to substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties if we or any of our representatives fail to comply with these laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIndex\n\u00b7\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights is key to our performance.\nWe protect our intellectual property rights as trade secrets, through patents, under confidentiality agreements, and through internal and external cyber security systems. We could incur significant costs in asserting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves from third party intellectual property claims. The laws of some of the countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse impact on our business.", "PERMNO": 59619, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "SXT"}
