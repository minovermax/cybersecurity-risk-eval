Risk Factors\nThe ownership of the Company's common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in the Company's securities. The Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of the Company's common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Merger\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees, suppliers, customers and other parties may have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties could impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to defer entering into contracts, or making other decisions, concerning doing business with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on our management and resources. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the Merger. The diversion of management's attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without the consent of Parent. These uncertainties and restrictions could disrupt or adversely affect our business and prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nStockholders may file lawsuits challenging the Merger, which may name us and/or our board of directors as defendants. We cannot assure you as to the outcome of such lawsuits, including the amount of costs associated with defending any such claim or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of any such claim. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is the absence of any order, injunction or other legal restraint by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that prevents the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, if any plaintiff in any lawsuit is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, such an injunction may delay the consummation of the Merger in the expected time-frame, or may prevent the Merger from being consummated altogether. Whether or not any plaintiff\u00eds claim is successful, this type of litigation may result in significant costs and diverts management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business.\nThere may be unexpected delays in the completion of the Merger, or the Merger may not be completed at all.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Certain events may delay the completion of the Merger or result in a termination of the Merger Agreement. Some of these events are outside the control of either party. We may incur significant additional costs in connection with any delay in completing the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, in addition to significant transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory, accounting and other costs we have already incurred.\nWe can neither assure you that the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that any adverse change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement will not occur, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether or when the Merger will be completed.\nFailure to complete the Merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively affect our stock price and future business and financial results.\nDelays in completing the Merger or the failure to complete the Merger at all could negatively affect our future business and financial results, and, in that event, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we will be subject to several risks, including the diversion of management\u00eds attention and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while working to implement the Merger, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our stock price. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction. In addition, if we do not complete the Merger, we may be required to pay a termination fee of approximately $4.7 million under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transition costs in connection with the Merger. We will be required to pay such costs relating to the transaction whether or not the Merger is consummated.\nWe will incur significant transaction and Merger-related transition costs.\nWe have incurred significant costs in connection with negotiating the Merger and expect that we will continue to incur significant costs in connection with completing the Merger and integrating the operations of the two companies. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the transaction is completed. If the Merger is not completed, we will not receive any benefit from these expenditures.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe demand for our products is influenced by general economic conditions and may be adversely affected by general economic downturns or declines in construction and/ or home remodeling activity.\nOur products are sold in the home improvement and new home construction markets. These markets are subject to significant fluctuations in activity and periodic downturns caused by general economic conditions. Slowdowns in the economy, construction, and/or home remodeling activity may result in a reduction of the demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability. A worsening of the current economic climate, including deterioration of the credit markets and/or consumer confidence, will negatively impact the Company's sales and profitability.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers could cause a substantial reduction in our revenues and profits.\nWe could be materially adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of our large existing customers. Our principal customer for our decking material is Lowe's, which accounted for approximately 45% of our sales in 2016. A loss of any one of our large customers would adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe may be unable to secure an adequate quantity of quality raw materials at economical prices.\nOur products are constructed primarily from scrap wood fiber and scrap polyethylene. The markets for such scrap materials are dynamic. The global demand for these materials has increased significantly and we expect demand to continue to increase. The largest component of our raw material costs is scrap polyethylene. Our future profitability is contingent on us being able to manage raw material costs under these circumstances.\nWeather\nSales of decking and accessories are subject to weather and seasonality trends associated with outdoor construction and accordingly adverse weather could have a negative impact on sales.", "PERMNO": 76023, "SIC": 2430, "TIC": "AERT"}
