{"cik": "795266", "company": "KB HOME", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-01-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS\nAlthough we have operated through a number of varying economic cycles, there are several risks that could affect our ability to conduct our business, which we discuss below. If any of these risks materialize, they could, among other things, (a) materially and adversely impact our results of operations and consolidated financial statements; and (b) cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking and other statements we make in our SEC filings; in our news releases and other public reports and communications, including those we post on or make available through our websites or other electronic channels; or orally through our personnel and representatives. These risks, and other factors outside of our control, could also create or increase volatility in our common stock\u2019s market price.\nConsumer Demand Risks. The following could negatively affect consumer demand for our products, thereby unfavorably impacting our net orders, homes delivered, average selling prices, revenues and/or profitability:\n\u2022Soft or negative economic or housing market conditions. Adverse conditions in our served markets or nationally could be caused or worsened by factors outside of our control, including, for example, due to the imposition and/or continuation of federal, state and/or local orders (e.g., quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d and similar mandates) for individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for businesses to significantly curtail or cease normal operations to address COVID-19 or other disease outbreaks or civil unrest, or a federal government shutdown or failure to approve additional COVID-19-related relief or stimulus measures, and financial markets\u2019 and businesses\u2019 reactions thereto. Among other impacts, a severe economic contraction may also trigger a rise in home purchase cancellations, as we experienced in our 2020 second quarter when we undertook proactive efforts to assure a backlog of qualified homebuyers amid the COVID-19 pandemic-induced economic downturn.\n\u2022Reduced employment levels and job and wage growth. While employment levels have improved since the 2020 second quarter, these trends may weaken or reverse in 2021, particularly if there are sustained COVID-19 outbreaks. If they do, our core first-time and first move-up homebuyer segments could be particularly affected, impacting us more severely than homebuilders that target a different buyer demographic.\n\u2022Lower population growth, household formations or other unfavorable demographic changes. These may be driven by, among other things, birth rate changes, economic factors or U.S. immigration policies.\n\u2022Diminished consumer confidence, whether generally or as to purchasing a home. Consumers may be reluctant to purchase a home compared to housing alternatives (such as renting apartments or homes, or remaining in their existing home) due to location or lifestyle preferences, affordability perceptions (particularly in markets experiencing rapid home price appreciation), employment instability or otherwise. Consumers may also decide not to search for a new home when there are significant public health risks in doing so in their area, which we saw across our served markets in the 2020 second quarter with the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\u2022Rising home selling prices. Steady demand for housing since 2013 combined with declining home inventories, in part reflecting a low supply of new homes compared to historical levels, has helped drive above-average home price appreciation across most markets for the past several years. If home selling prices, including our homes\u2019 selling prices, increase at a faster rate than consumer incomes, consumers, including and perhaps particularly those in our core first-time and first move-up homebuyer segments, may not be able to afford to purchase a home, including our homes.\n\u2022Tightened availability or affordability of mortgage loans and homeowner insurance coverage. Most of our buyers need a mortgage loan to purchase their home. Their ability to obtain a mortgage loan is largely subject to prevailing interest rates, lenders\u2019 credit standards and appraisals, and the availability of government-supported programs, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association (also known as Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (also known as Freddie Mac). If mortgage interest rates increase, credit standards are tightened, appraisals for our homes are lowered, or mortgage loan programs are curtailed, potential buyers of our homes may not be able to obtain necessary mortgage financing.\nInsurance companies are increasingly drawing back from issuing, or are measurably raising premiums for, homeowner insurance policies in areas that have experienced, or are thought to be at risk of experiencing, significant wildfires, hurricanes, flooding or other natural disasters. If potential homebuyers are unable to obtain affordable homeowner insurance coverage, they may decide not to pursue purchasing a home or may cancel a home purchase contract with us.\n\u2022Poor lender performance. We depend on third-party lenders, including our KBHS partner Stearns, to provide mortgage loans to our homebuyers, unlike homebuilders with a wholly-owned mortgage lender. These lenders may be unable or unwilling to complete, timely or at all, the loan originations they start for our homebuyers. Poorly performing lenders can significantly delay home closings, disrupting our production schedules and delivery forecasts, or cause home purchase contract cancellations. If KBHS performs poorly and our customers use another lender, the income from and value of our KBHS equity interest would decline.\nOn January 5, 2021, Guaranteed Rate, Inc. (\u201cGuaranteed Rate\u201d) announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Stearns\u2019 parent company and expected to close the transaction in the first calendar quarter of 2021. While the announcement indicated that Guaranteed Rate plans to use the acquisition to further scale its joint venture platform, we can offer no assurance that KBHS\u2019 operations will continue in their current form, or at all, after Guaranteed Rate closes its acquisition of Stearns. Even if KBHS\u2019 operations are maintained, its performance may be negatively affected by acquisition or post-acquisition integration activities and/or related management or other personnel changes, which, in turn, could result in one or more of the impacts described in the foregoing paragraph.\n\u2022Adverse tax law changes. If federal or state laws are changed to eliminate or reduce the income tax benefits associated with homeownership, such as personal tax deductions for mortgage loan interest costs and real estate taxes, the after-tax cost of homeownership could measurably increase and diminish consumer interest in buying a home, as could increases in personal income tax rates, which the incoming presidential administration may consider.\n\u2022Competition. We face significant competition for customers from other homebuilders, sellers of resale homes and other housing industry participants, including rental-housing operators. This competitive environment may, among other things, cause us to lower our home selling prices or offer incentives to attract or retain buyers.\n\u2022Seasonality. As discussed under Item 1 - Business in this report, we historically have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results with measurably more homes delivered and revenues generated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. However, as was the case in 2020, this pattern may not continue in the future at all or to the same degree as in the past.\nSupply Risks. The following could negatively affect our ability to increase our owned and controlled lot inventory, community count, operational scale and market share, and to grow our business, if at all:\n\u2022Lack of available land. Securing sufficient developable land that meets our investment return standards is critical for us to meet our strategic goals and profitably expand our business\u2019 scale. Land availability depends on several factors, including geographical/topographical/governmental constraints, sellers\u2019 business relationships and reputation within the residential real estate community, and competition from other parties, some of which can bid more for land. We expect to continue to face fierce competition for desirable land in our served markets in 2021, pressuring its availability and increasing its cost.\n\u2022Insufficient financial resources. Our business needs considerable cash to, among other things, acquire and develop land, build homes and provide customer service. We expect to meet our needs with existing cash, future operational cash flow, our unsecured revolving credit facility with various banks (\u201cCredit Facility\u201d) and unsecured letter of credit\nfacility with certain financial institutions (\u201cLOC Facility\u201d), or outside sources, including loans that are specifically obtained for, or secured by, particular communities or other inventory assets, which we refer to as project financing. However, outside financing may be unavailable, costly and/or considerably dilute stockholders. For instance:\n\u25e6Tight capital or financial market conditions may hinder our ability to obtain external financing, or use or expand our Credit Facility and LOC Facility, on favorable terms or at all. Also, if a rating agency downgrades our credit rating or outlook, external financing may be difficult and costly for us to obtain.\n\u25e6Noncompliance with our Credit Facility and senior notes\u2019 covenants may restrict our ability to borrow; accelerate repayment of our debt, which may not be feasible for us; or cause our lenders to impose significant fees or cease lending to us.\n\u25e6As described in Note 15 - Notes Payable in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, if a change of control or fundamental change occurs before our senior notes mature, we may need to offer to purchase certain of them. This may require us to refinance or restructure our debt, which we may be unable to do at all or on favorable terms.\n\u25e6Our debt and debt-to-capital levels could require us to dedicate substantial cash flow to debt service; inhibit our ability to respond to business changes or adjust our debt maturity schedule; curb execution on our current strategies; and/or make us more vulnerable in a downturn than our less-leveraged competitors. Our next senior note maturity is our $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior notes due December 15, 2021 (\u201c7.00% Senior Notes due 2021\u201d).\n\u2022Decreased land inventory value. Our land inventory\u2019s value depends on market conditions, including our estimates of applicable future demand and revenue generation. If conditions deteriorate during the typically significant amount of time between our acquiring ownership/control of land and delivering homes on that land; if we cannot sell land held for sale at its estimated fair value; or if we make strategic changes, we may need to record inventory-related charges. We may also record charges if we decide to sell land at a loss or activate or sell land held for future development.\nIn addition, our business could be negatively affected if our net orders, homes delivered or backlog-to-homes delivered conversion rate fall; if often-volatile building materials prices or subcontractor rates increase, which has been the trend over the past few years and was particularly the case with lumber in 2020; or if our community openings are delayed due to, among other things, prolonged development, our strategic adjustments, or protracted government approvals or utility service activations from staff or resource cuts or reallocations for public safety priorities (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, flooding, hurricanes or other natural disasters).\n\u2022Trade disputes and defective materials. The federal government has imposed new or increased import tariffs, and other countries have implemented retaliatory measures, raising the cost and reducing the supply of several home construction items. In addition, shortages or rising prices of building materials may ensue from manufacturing defects, resulting in recalls of materials. If such disputes continue or recalls occur, our costs and supply chain disruptions could increase further.\n\u2022Poor subcontractor availability and performance. Independent subcontractors perform essentially all of our land development and home construction work. Though we schedule and oversee such activities at our community sites, we have no control over our subcontractors\u2019 availability or work methods. If qualified subcontractors are not available (due to general shortages in a tight labor market, competition from other builders or otherwise), or do not timely perform, we may incur production delays and other inefficiencies, or higher costs for substitute services. Also, if our subcontractors\u2019 work or materials quality does not meet our standards, we could face more home warranty and construction defect claims, and they or their insurers may not be able to cover the associated repair costs.\n\u2022Responsibility for duties owed to subcontractors\u2019 employees. Governmental agencies have at times sought to hold contractors like us responsible for subcontractors\u2019 employment-related obligations to their workforces. For instance, under California law, regulators or others could assert that we are responsible for wages and benefits that our subcontractors fail to pay to their employees, or, in certain circumstances, it could be alleged that employees of our subcontractors should be deemed to be our employees. Further efforts to impose such external labor-related obligations on us could create substantial exposure for us in situations beyond our control.\nStrategy Risks. Our strategies, and any related initiatives or actions, and any changes thereto, may not be successful in achieving our goals or generate any growth, earnings or returns, particularly in a highly volatile business environment precipitated by a health or economic crisis, akin to our experience in the 2020 second quarter with the outbreak of COVID-19, or by social instability or distress, such as the civil unrest that arose at the end of May 2020 related to efforts to institute law\nenforcement and other social and political reforms. We may not achieve positive operational or financial results, or results equal to or better than we did in any prior period or in comparison to other homebuilders. We may also incur higher costs to build our homes than other homebuilders due to our commitment to sustainability, as discussed above under \u201cSustainability.\u201d Among other strategic risks, our business is presently concentrated in California, Florida, Nevada and Texas. Poor conditions in any of those markets could have a measurable negative impact on our results, and the impact could be larger for us than for other less-concentrated homebuilders. In addition, we may not be successful in generating positive results from our recent expansion into the Seattle, Washington market, our re-entry into the Charlotte, North Carolina market, or if we choose to enter into any other new markets, based on our relative inexperience with the local homebuilding and economic environment and the need to make a significant investment to achieve effective scale and profitable returns, which we may not be able to accomplish.\nAdverse conditions in California would have particular significance to our business. We generate the highest proportion of our revenues from and make significant inventory investments in our California operations. However, we may be constrained or delayed in entitling land and selling and delivering homes in California, and incur higher development or construction costs, from water conservation or wildfire protection measures (including precautionary and event-induced electricity blackouts, temporary or extended local or regional evacuations, development moratoriums in high-risk areas, and community resiliency design requirements) that are intended to address severe drought and climatic conditions that have arisen in recent years. In addition, as large-scale wildfires and flooding due to such conditions in California, as well as hurricanes, heavy rains and other climate change-driven natural disasters in other of our served markets, become more frequent and intense, we may experience greater disruption to our land development and homebuilding activities, delaying orders and home deliveries, among other impacts.\nAlso, California\u2019s highly regulated and litigious business environment has made the state an increasingly challenging and uncertain place for us to operate. This includes implementing regulations under the state\u2019s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB32) intended to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, we have and will continue to incur higher construction costs because of a state law requirement that effectively requires that all new homes permitted to build in 2020 and beyond have solar power systems, and we may be unable to offset (through customer leases) or cover such costs through selling price increases due to competition and consumer affordability concerns. In addition, California and certain of its local governments are considering or have implemented restrictions on or disincentives with respect to the creation or size of new suburban and exurban residential communities generally in favor of higher-density, urban developments that can be attractive to some buyers, but in many cases are on smaller parcels with higher building costs and more complicated entitlement requirements and may be subject to affordable housing mandates, prevailing wage requirements, greater local opposition and/or additional site remediation work. State and local municipalities have also considered banning natural gas use in new homes, among other possible steps, as part of their approaches to reduce greenhouse gases. Depending on their scope, these efforts could significantly increase our land acquisition and development costs and, along with increasing competition from other homebuilders and investors for available developable land, limit our California operations\u2019 growth, while making new homes less affordable to potential buyers in the state. Partially offsetting these trends, California\u2019s governor and certain legislators have taken positions to promote new housing construction, including the adoption of the Housing Crisis Act of 2019 (SB 330) intended to expedite the approval process for housing development in order to address the housing shortage in California.\nWarranty Risks. Our homebuilding business is subject to warranty and construction defect claims. Though we have insurance coverage to partially reduce our exposure, it is limited and costly, in part due to a shrinking provider market, and we have high self-insured retentions that are expected to increase. We self-insure some of our risk through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary.\nDue to our dependence on independent subcontractors to perform our homebuilding activities and inherent uncertainties, including obtaining recoveries from responsible subcontractors and/or their or our insurers, our recorded warranty and other liabilities may be inadequate to address future claims, which, among other things, could require us to record charges to increase such liabilities. We may also record charges to reflect our then-current claims experience, including the actual costs incurred. Home warranty and other construction defect issues may also generate negative publicity, including on social media and the Internet, that detracts from our reputation and efforts to sell homes.\nDeferred Tax Asset Recovery and Tax Position Risks. Our realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient future taxable income, which may not occur. Also, our deferred tax assets\u2019 value can increase or decrease with: (a) changes in the federal corporate income tax rate; (b) our undergoing a \u201cchange of ownership\u201d under federal tax rules, which would significantly reduce and possibly eliminate their value; and (c) adjustments in statutory or taxing authority treatment of such assets. We have filed our tax returns based on certain positions we believe are appropriate, and we may owe additional taxes if taxing authorities disagree with those positions.\nHuman Capital Risks. Our directors, officers and employees are important resources. If we cannot attract, retain and develop talent at reasonable pay and benefits levels or, alternatively, if we need to implement personnel or compensation reductions, our performance, profitability and ability to achieve our strategic goals could be significantly impaired. In addition, in many of our served markets, we need to have personnel with certain professional licenses, including building contractor and real estate brokerage licenses. Our home selling and construction activities may be severely disrupted or delayed if we do not have sufficient licensed individuals in our workforce.\nInformation Technology and Information Security Risks. We use information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) resources to carry out important operational activities and maintain our business records. Third parties maintain many of our IT resources, including disaster recovery and business continuity services, under agreements with evolving security and service level standards.\nOur systems have faced a variety of phishing, denial-of-service and other attacks. We have administrative, physical and technical controls and processes in place to address and mitigate cybersecurity risks and help protect our IT resources, including employee education and training, as well as third-party assessments. We also rely on our service providers, Stearns and other mortgage lenders with whom we share some personal identifying and confidential information to secure our information and the homebuyer information they collect from us. Our IT security costs, including cybersecurity insurance, are significant and will likely rise in tandem with the sophistication and frequency of system attacks.\nHowever, our, Stearns\u2019 and our service providers\u2019 measures may be inadequate and possibly have operational or security vulnerabilities that could go undetected for some period of time. If our IT resources are compromised by an intentional attack, natural or man-made disaster, electricity blackout, IT failure or systems misconfiguration, service provider error, mis-managed user access protocols, personnel action, or otherwise, we may be severely limited in conducting our business and achieving our strategic goals for an extended period, experience internal control failures or lose access to operational assets or funds. A substantial disruption, or security breach suffered by Stearns/KBHS or a service provider, could damage our reputation and result in the loss of customers or revenues, in sensitive personal information being publicly disclosed or misused and/or legal proceedings against us. We may incur significant expenses to resolve such issues.\nFor example, in December 2020, we were notified by SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC, which provides us with network management software, that a recent update to one of its products contained data collection malware that had also been distributed to thousands of its other clients, including federal, state and local government agencies, educational institutions and several private companies and governments around the world. We promptly removed and replaced the affected software product and have not identified any instance of internal data being communicated outside of our organization through the malware, or any other compromise of our IT systems. We are continuing to work with our cybersecurity vendors to monitor any impact or activity related to the malware and are tracking governmental notifications and directives as they are issued. While we believe we were not negatively affected by the malware, we have invested additional management time and resources in response to this outside vendor incident.\nWe have invested significant resources over the past few years to develop and implement a new custom enterprise resource planning system designed to improve the efficiency of our internal operational and administrative activities. There are inherent risks in undertaking this type of broad-based IT project and we have experienced complications and delays during the implementation process. We expect these will continue as we progress and expand the scope of the system in 2021 and that we will incur appreciable additional costs in doing so. In addition, the testing and use of the new system during this rollout could increase our exposure to the security risks and consequences discussed in the foregoing paragraph.\nLegal and Compliance Risks. As discussed under Item 1 - Business, our operations are subject to myriad legal and regulatory requirements, which can delay our operational activities, raise our costs and/or prohibit or restrict homebuilding in some areas. For example, certain of our Texas operations are subject to rules mandating enhanced flood management practices stemming from recent large hurricanes and rainstorms. These requirements often provide broad discretion to government authorities, and they could be interpreted or revised in ways unfavorable to us. The costs to comply, or associated with any noncompliance, are, or can be, significant and variable from period to period. With respect to environmental laws, in addition to the risks and potential operational costs discussed above, we have been, and we may in the future be, involved in federal, state and local air and water quality agency investigations or proceedings for potential noncompliance with their rules, including rules governing discharges of materials into the air and waterways; stormwater discharges from community sites; and wetlands and listed species habitat protection. We could incur penalties and/or be restricted from developing or building at certain community locations during or as a result of such agencies\u2019 investigations or findings.\nAdditionally, we are involved in legal, arbitral or regulatory proceedings or investigations incidental to our business, the outcome or settlement of which could result in material claims, losses, monetary damage awards, penalties, or other direct or indirect payments recorded against our earnings, or injunctions, consent decrees or other voluntary or involuntary restrictions or adjustments to our business operations or practices. Any adverse results could be beyond our expectations, insurance coverages\nand/or accruals at particular points in time. Unfavorable outcomes, as well as unfavorable investor, analyst or news reports related to our industry, company, personnel or operations, may also generate negative publicity, including on social media and the Internet, damaging our reputation and resulting in the loss of customers or revenues.\nTo reduce the risks and expected significant costs of defending intra-corporate proceedings in multiple venues and to help ensure that such matters are considered within a well-established body of law, our By-laws provide that, subject to certain exceptions, Delaware state courts are the exclusive forum for specified internal corporate affairs actions. This may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in their favored forum. At the same time, if a court were to allow for an alternative forum, or we waive the provision\u2019s application, for a particular matter, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving an otherwise relevant action in another jurisdiction(s).\nThe European Union and state governments, notably California and Nevada, have enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations, and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections. These regulations impose certain obligations for securing, and potentially removing, specified personal information in our systems, and for apprising individuals of the information we have collected about them. We have incurred costs in an effort to comply with these data privacy risks and requirements, and our costs may increase significantly as risks become increasingly complex or if new or changing requirements are enacted, and based on how individuals exercise their rights. For example, in November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24 (Consumer Personal Information Law and Agency Initiative), which will increase data privacy requirements for our business when its provisions take effect in 2023. Despite our efforts, any noncompliance could result in our incurring substantial penalties and reputational damage.\nKBHS\u2019 operations are heavily regulated. If Stearns, which oversees KBHS\u2019 operations, or KBHS is found to have violated regulations, or mortgage investors demand KBHS repurchase mortgage loans it has sold to them, or cover their losses, for claimed contract breaches, KBHS could face significant liabilities, which, if they exceed its reserves, could result in our recognizing losses on our KBHS equity interest.\nOur financial results may be materially affected by the adoption of new or amended financial accounting standards, including those relating to revenue recognition and lease accounting, and regulatory or outside auditor guidance or interpretations.\nPandemic Risks. An epidemic, pandemic or similar serious public health issue, and the measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address it, could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period, and thereby, and/or along with any associated economic and/or social instability or distress, have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. We experienced significant impacts to our business during 2020, beginning in mid-March, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 control responses by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities, including quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders and similar mandates.\nIn response to the initial COVID-19 control responses in our served markets, we temporarily closed our sales centers, model homes and design studios to the general public, shifted to an appointment-only personalized home sales process and prioritized our warranty service activities to respond to emergency repair requests, and otherwise on a by-exception basis, in each case as and where permitted and following recommended distancing and other health and safety protocols when meeting in person with a customer. We also leveraged our virtual sales tools to give customers the ability to shop for a new KB home from their mobile device or personal computer. In addition, we shifted our corporate and division office functions to work remotely. We limited our construction operations largely to authorized activities with increased safety measures and experienced a reduction in the availability, capacity and efficiency of municipal and private services necessary to the progress of developing land, building homes, completing mortgage loans and delivering homes to varying degrees depending on the scope of the restrictions local authorities established.\nAlthough we gradually resumed nearly all of our operations with the relaxing of the early COVID-19 control responses beginning late in our 2020 second quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year, the magnitude and duration of the business and economic impacts from the unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19 have produced ongoing uncertainty about the overall operating environment going forward and made it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and to develop strategies to generate growth. Moreover, we can provide no assurance as to whether the COVID-19 public health effort will be intensified to such an extent, particularly in response to any resurgence in infections, whether due to the spread of any variants of the virus or otherwise, combined with the seasonal flu, that we will not be able to conduct any business operations in certain of our served markets or at all for an indefinite period. Certain of our served markets have recently seen a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases, and more stringent COVID-19 control responses have been re-instituted. Therefore, we could again experience in 2021 material disruptions in our operating environment, impairing our ability to sell and build homes in a typical manner, as occurred in our 2020 second\nquarter, or at all, due to, among other things, increased costs or decreased supply of building materials; reduced availability of subcontractors, employees and other talent, including as a result of infections or medically necessary or recommended self-quarantining, which we have experienced in a few locations; or governmental mandates to direct production activities to support public health efforts. This could result in our recognizing charges in future periods, which may be material, for inventory impairments or land option contract abandonments, or both, related to our inventory assets.\nShould the adverse impacts described above (or others that are currently unknown) occur, whether individually or collectively, we would expect to experience, among other things, decreases in our net orders, homes delivered, average selling prices, revenues and profitability, as we did during our 2020 second quarter, and such impacts could be material to our consolidated financial statements in 2021 and beyond. In addition, should the COVID-19 public health effort intensify to such an extent that we cannot operate in most or all of our served markets, we could generate few or no orders and deliver few, if any homes during the applicable period, which could be prolonged. Along with an increase in cancellations of home purchase contracts, if there are prolonged government restrictions on our business and our customers, and/or an extended economic recession, we could be unable to produce revenues and cash flows sufficient to conduct our business; meet the terms of our covenants and other requirements under the Credit Facility, our senior notes and the related indenture, and/or mortgages and land contracts due to land sellers and other loans; service our outstanding debt; or pay any dividends to our stockholders. Such a circumstance could, among other things, exhaust our available liquidity (and ability to access liquidity sources) and/or trigger an acceleration to pay a significant portion or all of our then-outstanding debt obligations, which we may be unable to do.\nOther Risks. The risk factors described above are not our only salient risks. Political events, war, terrorism, weather or other natural/environmental disasters, and other risks that are currently unknown or seen as immaterial, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, consolidated financial statements and/or common stock\u2019s market price.", "PERMNO": 70092, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "KBH"}
