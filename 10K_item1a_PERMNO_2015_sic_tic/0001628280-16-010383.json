RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report on Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by words such as: \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cwill\u201d and similar references to future periods.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nOur business faces numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control. The impact of these risks, as well as other unforeseen risks, could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The trading price of our common stock or our senior notes could decline as a result. You should consider these risks before deciding to invest in, or maintain your investment in, our common stock or senior notes.\nBankruptcy-Specific Risk Factors\nQuiksilver, Inc. and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code filed with the Bankruptcy Court on September 9, 2015. For the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Bankruptcy Cases from time to time;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, execute, confirm and consummate the Proposed Plan or any other plan of reorganization with respect to the Bankruptcy Cases;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a U.S. trustee or to convert the Bankruptcy Cases to chapter 7 cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain normal payment and other terms with credit card companies, customers, vendors and service providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain management and other key employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key vendors or secure alternative supply sources;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate financing.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Bankruptcy Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nThese risks and uncertainties could significantly affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative publicity or events associated with the Bankruptcy Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and employees, as well as with customers, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we need Bankruptcy Court approval for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond to certain events in a timely manner or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Bankruptcy Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that\nevents occurring during the Chapter 11 proceedings and its outcome will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the Bankruptcy Cases, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may sell or otherwise dispose of a portion or all of our assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nOur businesses could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. Failure to obtain this approval in a timely manner could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows, as our ability to obtain financing to fund our operations may be adversely affected by a protracted bankruptcy proceeding. If a protracted reorganization or liquidation is to occur, there is a significant risk that our enterprise value would be substantially eroded to the detriment of all stakeholders.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to the plan of reorganization. Even if a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders to do business with a company that may have recently emerged from bankruptcy.\nOperating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, transactions outside the ordinary course of business will be subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond to certain events in a timely manner or take advantage of certain opportunities. We must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with our vendors;\n\u2022\nbuy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nborrow for our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of our Proposed Plan, sufficient debtor-in-possession financing may not be available, and our emergence from the Bankruptcy Cases is not assured.\nThere can be no assurance that the Proposed Plan (or any other plan of reorganization) will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court, you should exercise extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in our securities.\nThere can be no assurances that we will receive the requisite votes to confirm the Proposed Plan. We might also receive official objections to confirmation of the Proposed Plan from the various bankruptcy committees and stakeholders in the Bankruptcy Cases. As such, we cannot predict the impact that any objection might have on the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision whether to confirm or not the Proposed Plan. Any objection may cause us to devote significant resources in response which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the DIP Facilities may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements or may be restricted or ultimately terminated by the lenders under the DIP Facilities for our breach thereof.\nIf the Proposed Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, or cash flows and borrowings under the DIP Facilities are not sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, it is uncertain whether we would be able to reorganize our business. It is also not certain whether any distributions holders of claims against us, including holders of our secured and unsecured debt and equity, would ultimately receive any sum of money with respect to their claims. Our debtors would likely incur significant costs in connection with developing and seeking approval of an alternative plan of reorganization, or additional financing, which might not be supported by any of the current debt holders, various bankruptcy committees or other stakeholders. If an alternative plan of reorganization could not be agreed upon, or additional financing could not be secured, it is possible that we would have to liquidate a portion or all of our assets, in which case it is likely that holders of claims would receive substantially less favorable distribution than they would receive if we were to emerge as a viable, reorganized entity. There can also be no assurance as to\nwhether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the Bankruptcy Cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the Bankruptcy Cases.\nThe PSA may terminate.\nThe PSA may terminate if, among other things, the deadlines set forth therein are not met or if the conditions precedent to the Plan Sponsors\u2019 obligation to support the Proposed Plan or to confirm the Proposed Plan are not satisfied in accordance with the terms of the PSA. If the PSA terminates, we may not be able to obtain the support necessary to confirm the Proposed Plan.\nThe Backstop Commitment Letter may terminate.\nThe occurrence of the effective date of the Proposed Plan is predicated on, among other things, the receipt of the Backstop Commitment (as defined in the Backstop Commitment Letter) pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Letter. The Backstop Commitment Letter may terminate if, among other things, any Plan Sponsor Termination Event, as described in \u00a7 5.01 of the PSA, occurs. If we do not receive the Backstop Commitment, we will not be able to effectuate the transactions scheduled for consummation on the Effective Date.\nThe Debtors may not be able to consummate the Rights Offering.\nThe occurrence of the Effective Date is predicated on, among other things, the consummation of the Rights Offerings. We may not be able to consummate the Rights Offerings if, among other things, we do not receive the Backstop Commitment from the Backstop Parties. Failure to consummate the Exit Rights Offering will result our inability to effectuate the transactions scheduled for consummation on the Effective Date.\nThe Debtors may not be able to obtain favorable pricing with respect to the Exit Facility or may not be able to secure commitments for exit financing.\nThe occurrence of the Effective Date is predicated on, among other things, the receipt of financing under the Exit Facility. We do not have committed financing for this credit facility. Although we intend to negotiate with the DIP Lenders and others with respect to the Exit Facility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate definitive documents and receive any or all of the necessary financing, or that we will receive the Exit Financing on favorable terms. If we do not receive the necessary financing under the Exit Facility, we will not be able to effectuate the transactions scheduled for consummation on the Effective Date.\nWe depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel to execute our business plans. Our deteriorating financial performance, along with the Bankruptcy Cases, puts us at risk of losing talent critical to the successful reorganization and ongoing operation of our business. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we lose any of these persons during or subsequent to the Bankruptcy Cases, including as a result of any planned overhead reductions required by our business plan. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain qualified replacements as needed in the future. Following the Effective Date, we plan to implement a Management Incentive Plan, which may mitigate some of the foregoing risks.\nOur senior management team and other key personnel may not be able to execute the business plans as currently developed, given the substantial distraction to such individuals caused by these Bankruptcy Cases.\nAs discussed above, the execution of our business plans depends on the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel to execute our business plans. Such individuals may be required to devote significant efforts to the Bankruptcy Cases, thereby potentially impairing their abilities to execute the business plans. Accordingly, our business plan may not be implemented as anticipated, which may cause its financial results to materially deviate from the current projections.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Bankruptcy Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation and specified debts arising afterwards. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to September 9, 2015 and before confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any material claims not ultimately discharged by the Bankruptcy Court could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nWhile in bankruptcy, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments and dispositions, restructuring activities, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filings. In addition, if we emerge from bankruptcy, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. Moreover, if we emerge from bankruptcy, we may be required to adopt fresh start accounting. If fresh start accounting is applicable, our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date. The fair value of our assets and liabilities may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. If fresh start accounting is required, our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting may be materially different from historical trends.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to maintain our operations during the Bankruptcy Cases or fund our emergence from the bankruptcy.\nBecause of our weakened financial condition, we will have heightened exposure to, and less ability to withstand, the operating risks that are customary in our industry, such as fluctuations in raw material prices and currency exchange rates. Any of these factors could result in the need for substantial additional funding. A number of other factors, including our Chapter 11 filings, our financial results in recent years, our substantial indebtedness and the competitive environment we face, adversely affect the availability and terms of funding that might be available to us during, and upon emergence from, the bankruptcy. As such, we may not be able to source capital at rates acceptable to us, or at all, to fund our current operations or our exit from bankruptcy. The inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations, both currently and upon emergence from bankruptcy.\nAdditional Risk Factors\nFinancial and competitive difficulties of our wholesale customers (independent retailers) may negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur wholesale business has been negatively impacted in some areas due to financial and competitive difficulties experienced by some of our independent wholesale customers. Our business may continue to be adversely impacted in the future as a result of such difficulties. Any continuation of financial and competitive difficulties for, or deterioration in the financial health of, our current or prospective wholesale customers could result in decreased sales, uncollectible receivables, increased product returns, decreased margins, or an inability to introduce new products or generate new business. Also, any consolidation of retail accounts, or concentration of market share in a specific area, could significantly increase our credit risk. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as consumers become more confident shopping online, our wholesale channel customers face increased competition from online competitors, including, but not limited to, Amazon in the Americas, Zalando in EMEA, and Taobao in China. These online competitors may have lower cost structures, higher sales volumes, wider product assortments, and faster marketing response times than some of our traditional wholesale channel customers. In addition, our smaller independent wholesale accounts may face competitive challenges from large multi-location accounts that benefit from better pricing and terms due to higher purchasing volume, larger marketing investments, higher levels of support from suppliers, and superior financial condition. Also, we have made, and plan to make, changes to our wholesale sales force structure whereby wholesale accounts generating less than a minimum annual order volume will not be serviced by a salesperson, but will instead be provided a self-service website from which they may order our products. Lastly, our plans to reduce the size of our product assortment available to wholesale customers could have the effect of reducing wholesale revenues. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, difficulties in expanding or maintaining our wholesale channel revenues due to these and other factors. Such difficulties in our wholesale channel could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition and the Bankruptcy Cases.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial performance has been, and may continue to be, negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions. Continued or further recessionary economic conditions, or other macro economic factors, may have an adverse impact on our sales volumes, pricing levels and profitability. As domestic and international economic conditions change, trends in discretionary consumer spending become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future. When consumers reduce discretionary spending, purchases of specialty apparel and footwear, like our products, tend to decline which may result in reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, and/or unanticipated discounts. A continuation of the general reduction in consumer discretionary spending in the domestic and international economies, as well as the impact\nof tight credit markets on us, our suppliers, other vendors or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe apparel, footwear and accessories industries are each highly competitive, and if we fail to compete effectively, we could lose our market position and/or market share.\nThe apparel, footwear and accessories industries are each highly competitive. We compete against a number of domestic and international brands, manufacturers, retailers and distributors of apparel, footwear and accessories. In order to compete effectively, we must: (1) maintain the image of our brands and our reputation for authenticity in our core markets; (2) be flexible and innovative in responding to rapidly changing market demands; and (3) offer consumers a wide variety of high quality products at competitive prices.\nThe purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as brand image, marketing programs and product design. Several of our global competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including greater financial resources for competitive activities, such as sales, marketing, strategic acquisitions and athlete endorsements. The number of our direct competitors and the intensity of competition may increase as we expand into other product lines or as other companies expand into our product categories. Our competitors may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions or prevent us from taking advantage of such combinations or alliances. Our competitors also may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, standards or consumer preferences. Our competitors may offers sales terms and conditions that we are unwilling or unable to match. If we fail to retain our competitive position, our sales could decline significantly which would have a material adverse effect on our market share or results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to develop innovative and stylish products in response to rapid changes in consumer demands and fashion trends, we may suffer a decline in our revenues and market share.\nThe apparel, footwear and accessories industries are subject to rapidly changing consumer demands based on fashion trends and performance features. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences in a timely manner while preserving the authenticity and image of our brands and the quality of our products.\nAs is typical with new products, market acceptance of new designs and products we may introduce is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured. If trends shift away from our products, or if we misjudge the market for our product lines, we may be faced with significant amounts of unsold inventory or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure of new product designs or new product lines to gain market acceptance could also adversely affect our business and the image of our brands. Achieving market acceptance for new products may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to expand consumer demand. These requirements could strain our management, financial and operational resources. If we do not continue to develop stylish and innovative products that provide better design and performance attributes than the products of our competitors, or if our future product lines misjudge consumer demands, we may lose consumer loyalty, which could result in a decline in our revenues and market share.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels.\nWe maintain an inventory of selected products that we anticipate will be in demand. We may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or the sale of excess inventory at discounted or closeout prices. These events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues, any of which could harm our business.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to execute our internal plans to transition our supply chain and certain other business processes to global scope.\nWe are in the process of transitioning our footwear and apparel supply chains, as well as certain other business processes, to global scope. If our globalization efforts fail to produce planned efficiencies, or the transition is not managed effectively, we may experience excess inventories, inventory shortage, late deliveries, lost revenues, or increased costs. Any business disruption arising from our globalization efforts, or our failure to effectively execute our internal plans for globalization, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. In addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to satisfy customer demand, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could cause a decline in revenue and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe demand for our products is seasonal and is dependent upon several unpredictable factors.\nConsumer demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Consumer demand is dependent on many factors, including customer acceptance of our product designs, fashion trends, economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, weather patterns during peak selling periods, and numerous other factors beyond our control. The seasonality of our business and/or misjudgment in anticipating consumer demands could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is subject to pricing pressures that may adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe source many of our products offshore because manufacturing costs, particularly labor costs, are generally less than in the U.S. Many of our competitors also source their products offshore, possibly at lower costs than ours, and they may use these cost savings to reduce prices. To remain competitive, we may be forced to adjust our prices from time to time in response to these pricing pressures. As a result, our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices while we are unable to reduce production costs or our production costs increase and we are unable to proportionately increase our prices. Any inability on our part to effectively respond to changing prices and sourcing costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, labor, and transportation could cause manufacturing delays and increase our costs.\nThe prices of the fabrics used to manufacture our products depend largely on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields and weather patterns. In addition, the cost of labor at many of our third party manufacturers has been increasing significantly. The cost of logistics and transportation fluctuates in large part due to the price of oil. Any fluctuations in the cost and availability of any of our raw materials or other sourcing costs could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and our ability to meet consumer demands.\nFactors affecting international commerce and our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition.\nWe generate the majority of our revenues from outside of the United States, and we anticipate that revenue from our international operations could account for an increasingly larger portion of our revenue in the future. Our international operations are directly related to, and dependent on, the volume of international trade and foreign market conditions. International commerce and our international operations are subject to many risks, including:\n\u2022\nrecessions in foreign economies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe adoption and expansion of trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights under the laws of other countries;\n\u2022\nlonger receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nsocial, political and economic instability, terrorism or other hostilities;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign tax rates;\n\u2022\ntariffs, sanctions and other trade barriers; and\n\u2022\nU.S. government licensing requirements for exports.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these risks may restrict our ability to operate in the affected regions and decrease the profitability of our international operations, which may harm our financial condition.\nWe have established, and may continue to establish, joint ventures in various foreign territories with independent third party business partners to distribute and sell Quiksilver, Roxy, DC and other branded products in such territories. In addition, we may decide to acquire the remaining portion of existing joint ventures that we do not own. These joint ventures are subject to substantial risks and liabilities associated with their operations, as well as the risk that our relationships with our joint venture partners do not succeed in the manner that we anticipate. If our joint venture operations, or our relationships with our joint venture partners, are not successful, we could face litigation or legal costs in connection with exiting the relationship or delays in making planned changes to our operations in the applicable territories. These costs, delays, and/or investments could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe have operations in certain emerging markets and developing countries where the risk of asset misappropriation, civil unrest or social instability, theft, other crimes, or frivolous claims is higher than in more developed countries. Likewise, there is less protection for intellectual property rights of foreign companies in these jurisdictions. These risks can significantly increase the cost of operations in such markets.\nIn addition, as we continue to expand our overseas operations, we are subject to certain anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. We must use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure our employees and agents comply with these laws. If any of our overseas operations, or our employees or agents, violates such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or significant penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nUncertainty of changing international trade regulations and quotas on imports of textiles and apparel may adversely affect our business.\nQuotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently import raw materials and/or finished garments into the majority of countries in which we sell our products. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties.\nIn addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or into which they are imported may, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, new workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports, or otherwise adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these costs and restrictions could harm our business.\nWe rely on third party manufacturers and problems with, or loss of, our suppliers or raw materials could harm our business and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our products are produced by independent manufacturers. We face the risk that these third party manufacturers with whom we contract to produce our products may not produce and deliver our products on a timely basis, or at all. We also may be subject to credit reductions and other changes in our business relationships with our suppliers, vendors and customers if they perceive that we would be unable to pay our debts to them in a timely manner. We cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications and regulatory and customer requirements, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in materials and manufacturing costs or other business interruptions or failures due to deteriorating economies. The failure or unwillingness of any manufacturer to perform to our expectations could result in supply shortages or delays for certain products and harm our business. Our business may also be harmed by material increases to our cost of goods as a result of increasing labor costs, which manufacturers have recently faced.\nIf our independent manufacturers fail to comply with appropriate laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights, quality standards, environmental standards, production practices, or other obligations and norms, our reputation and brand image could be negatively impacted and we could be exposed to litigation and additional costs which would adversely affect our operational efficiency and results of operations.\nThe capacity of our manufacturers to manufacture our products also is dependent, in part, upon the availability of raw materials. Our manufacturers may experience shortages of raw materials, which could result in delays in deliveries of our products by our manufacturers or increased costs to us. Any shortage of raw materials or inability of a manufacturer to\nmanufacture or ship our products in a timely manner, or at all, could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a cost-efficient, timely manner and could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our customers. As a result, we could experience cancellations of orders, refusals to accept deliveries, or reductions in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing and logistics providers may be unable or unwilling to do business with us, and manufacture or delivery of our goods and merchandise may be delayed.\nWe order goods for each \u201cselling season\u201d several months in advance of the start of such season, and the goods must be placed \u201con board\u201d vessels for shipment as early as three months prior to the start of the season. As the first batches of products arrive in the United States, they are distributed through retail and wholesale channels to fill orders for the start of the selling season. If the first scheduled shipments are missed, there will simply not be time for another vendor to produce replacement goods. This would jeopardize our ability to service our customers, and would likely result in reduced customer goodwill and loss of market share. Not only would we be unable to supply its retail stores, our relationships with our wholesalers may be jeopardized, as the wholesalers may choose to work with other suppliers for the remainder of the season. If our manufacturers or logistics providers are unable, due to a natural disaster or otherwise, or unwilling, on account of the pendency of the Bankruptcy Cases or otherwise, to continue to produce, ship, and release goods to or for us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe agreements governing our debt obligations contain, and the Exit Facility Credit Agreement will contain, various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nThe DIP Facilities contain covenants that limit or restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to engage in other transactions or business activities that may be important to our growth strategy or otherwise important to us. The DIP Facilities, limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ntransfer and sell assets;\n\u2022\neffect a consolidation or merger; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets to secure debt.\nOur ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Any breach of the covenants in the DIP Facilities could cause a default under the DIP Facilities and other debt, which would restrict the ability to borrow under the DIP Facilities, thereby significantly impacting our liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. If there were an event of default under the DIP Facilities that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under the DIP Facilities if accelerated upon an event of default. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, the DIP Facilities, the lenders under those facilities could seek to institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets securing borrowings under the DIP Facilities.\nThe credit agreement for and all documents executed in connection with the Exit Facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the \u201cExit Financing Credit Agreement\u201d) contemplated by the Plan may contain covenants, restrictions, events of default, and other provisions similar to the DIP Facilities. Any breach of such covenants in the Exit Financing Credit Agreement could cause a default under the Exit Financing and other debt, which would restrict the ability to borrow under the Exit Financing, thereby significantly impacting our liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. If there were an event of default under the Exit Financing Credit Agreement that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could exercise all rights and remedies under such credit agreement. Such rights and remedies may include causing all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and cash flows may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under the Exit Financing Credit Agreement if accelerated upon an event of default. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness\nunder, or amend the covenants contained in the Exit Financing Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Exit Facility could seek to institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets securing borrowings under the Exit Financing Credit Agreement.\nOur Euro Notes Indenture similarly contains covenants, restrictions, events of default, and other provisions that will remain applicable following the Effective Date, and any amendment of the Euro Notes Indenture in connection with the Exchange Offer may contain similar covenants, restrictions, events of default, and other provisions. Any breach of such covenants could cause a default under the Euro Notes Indenture. If there were an event of default, the holders of the Euro Notes could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the Euro Notes to be due and payable immediately, and the same may occur with respect to any amended Euro Notes Indenture. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under the Euro Notes if accelerated upon an event of default.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to protect our worldwide intellectual property rights, and our inability to enforce these rights could harm our business.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, service marks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property. We rely on the intellectual property, patent, trademark and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. From time to time, we resort to litigation to protect these rights, and these proceedings can be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail.\nWe have obtained some U.S. and foreign trademarks, patents and service mark registrations, and have applied for additional ones, but cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. The loss of trademarks, patents and service marks, or the loss of the exclusive use of our trademarks, patents and service marks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks, patents and service marks on a worldwide basis and continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks, patents and service marks, as appropriate. There can be no assurance that our actions taken to establish and protect our trademarks, patents and service marks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of their trademark, patent or other proprietary rights.\nWe may be subject to claims that our products have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.\nWe cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Moreover, we may need to redesign, discontinue or rename some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products.\nWe may be adversely affected by legal proceedings to which we are, or may become, a party.\nWe, and our subsidiaries are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur ability to effectively manage and maintain our supply chain, ship products to customers, and invoice customers on a timely basis depends significantly on several key information systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of any of these systems, could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach.\nIn addition, hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. Despite security measures that we and our third party vendors have in place, any breach of our or our third party service providers\u2019 networks\nmay result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. Any inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could expose us to risks of litigation and liability, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates may affect the fair market value of our assets.\nChanges in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may affect the fair market value of our assets. Specifically, decreases in interest rates will positively impact the value of our assets and the strengthening of the dollar will negatively impact the value of our net foreign assets.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our reported revenues and costs.\nWe are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales, royalty income, and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. We are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from U.S. transactions that are not denominated in U.S. dollars. If we are unsuccessful in hedging these potential losses, our operating results could be negatively impacted and ours cash flows could be significantly reduced. In some cases, as part of its risk management strategies, we may choose not to hedge such risks. If we misjudge these risks, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We may use foreign currency exchange contracts, or other derivatives, to hedge certain currency exchange risks. Such derivatives may expose us to counterparty risks, and there can be no guarantee that such derivatives will be effective as hedges.\nFurthermore, we may be exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the statements of operations and balance sheets of its international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. We may (but generally do not) use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the profit and loss effects of this translation effect because such exposures are generally non-cash in nature and because accounting rules would require us to mark these contracts to fair value in the statement of operations at the end of each financial reporting period. We translate our revenues and expenses at average exchange rates during the period. As a result, the reported revenues and expenses of our international subsidiaries would decrease if the U.S. dollar increased in value in relation to other currencies, including but not limited to the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, or Russian ruble.\nChanges with respect to our licensing program could adversely impact our business.\nHistorically, we have licensed certain product categories to third party licensees which have the right to design, source, and sell certain products bearing our trademarks. By the first half of fiscal year 2017, we anticipate completing a transition to in-source substantially all licensee product categories. Unforeseen issues from this transition could result in (i) temporary sales pressure as the market adjusts to our in-house product offering and/or (ii) temporary inefficiencies in product design and sourcing.\nWork stoppages or other labor issues could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe have no unionized employees, but certain French employees are represented by workers\u2019 counsels. As we have little control over union activities, we could face difficulties in the future should our workforce become unionized. There can be no assurance that we will not experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future with our non-unionized employees or employees represented by workers\u2019 counsels.\nThe effects of war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or other unforeseen wide-scale events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe continued threat of terrorism, and associated heightened security measures and military actions in response to acts of terrorism, have disrupted commerce and have intensified uncertainties in the U.S. and international economies. Any further acts of terrorism, escalated hostilities, a future war, or a widespread natural or other disaster may disrupt commerce, undermine consumer confidence and lead to a further downturn in the U.S. or international economies, which could negatively impact our revenues. Furthermore, an act of terrorism, war or the implementation of trade sanctions, or the threat thereof, or any natural or other disaster that results in unforeseen interruptions of commerce could negatively impact our business by interfering with our ability to obtain products from our manufacturers.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. It is probable our common stock will be canceled and that holders of such common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nIt is too early to definitively determine if our Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will allow for distributions with respect to our common stock. It is probable that these equity interests will be canceled and extinguished upon the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of any such plan and the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of these equity interests, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding equity securities will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding common stock would have no value. Trading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of such securities in the Bankruptcy Cases. Accordingly, we encourage that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nOur common stock is delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and will not be listed on any other national securities exchange.\nWe received notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) that trading of our common stock was suspended at the opening of business on September 9, 2015 and the NYSE filed with the SEC to remove our common stock from listing and registration on the NYSE.\nAs a result, our common stock now trades in the over-the-counter (\"OTC\") market. The trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than the NYSE may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, securities which trade in the OTC market are not eligible for margin loans and make our common stock subject to the provisions of Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the \u201cpenny stock rule.\u201d\nOur common stock may become subject to the associated risks of trading in an OTC market.\nSecurities traded in the OTC market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange, due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. Because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the market\u2019s perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Bankruptcy Cases. If our securities begin trading in the OTC market, in some cases, we may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in the issuance of our securities. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future.", "PERMNO": 75527, "SIC": 2320, "TIC": "ZQKSQ"}
