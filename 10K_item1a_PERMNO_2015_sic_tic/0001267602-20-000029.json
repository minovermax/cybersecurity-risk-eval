You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as all the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this report, before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR DEPENDENCE ON ILUVIEN\nWe rely on a single manufacturer for ILUVIEN, a single manufacturer for the ILUVIEN applicator and a single manufacturer for ILUVIEN\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredient. Our business would be seriously harmed if any of these third parties are unable to satisfy our demand and alternative sources are not available.\nWe do not have, nor do we currently intend to establish, in-house manufacturing capability. We depend entirely on, and have agreements with, a single third-party manufacturer for each of:\n\u2022\nthe manufacture of the ILUVIEN implant, final assembly of the injector with the implant and release testing for the U.S. (Alliance Medical Products, Inc., a Siegfried Company (Alliance)),\n\u2022\nthe manufacture of the ILUVIEN applicator (FlexMedical or an affiliate of Flextronics International, Ltd. (Flextronics)),\n\u2022\nthe manufacture of ILUVIEN\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredient (FARMABIOS SpA./Byron Chemical Company Inc. (FARMABIOS)), and\n\u2022\nthe quality release testing of ILUVIEN in the European Economic Area (EEA) including the U.K., post Brexit (AndersonBrecon Limited trading as Packaging Coordinators, Inc. (PCI)).\nIf any of the third-party manufacturers (a) breach their agreements, (b) are unable to meet their contractual or quality requirements or (c) become unwilling to perform for any reason, we may be unable, or may be unable in a timely manner, to locate alternative acceptable manufacturers, enter into favorable agreements with them and ensure that they are approved by the applicable regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Further, all of our manufacturers rely on additional third parties for the manufacture of component parts. Any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of ILUVIEN implants, the ILUVIEN applicator or the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a timely manner from these third parties could delay commercial production of ILUVIEN and adversely affect our ability to fulfill demand for ILUVIEN, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue, operations and cash flow.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we were unable to obtain a sufficient number of ILUVIEN units to meet end user demand in the ordinary course of business (a stock-out) due to greater than anticipated demand in the fourth quarter of 2019 and an equipment issue within our third-party manufacturing facility. Although we have now rectified the equipment issue and believe that this unavailability of product during this period will not materially affect our overall revenues for 2020, any recurrence, for whatever reason, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, reputation and relationships with our distributors and end users.\nWe must replace our key third-party manufacturer of certain component parts of the ILUVIEN injector before our manufacturing contract with the manufacturer expires on September 30, 2020, and we may be unable to replace that third party on favorable terms in a timely manner, or at all.\nOn March 28, 2019 we received notice (dated April 1, 2019) from Flextronics Medical Sales and Marketing, Ltd. (Flextronics) that it intends to terminate the Manufacturing Services Agreement dated March 2, 2012 between us and Flextronics for the manufacture of certain component parts of the ILUVIEN injector (the Flextronics Agreement). Based on Flextronics\u2019 notice, the Flextronics Agreement will terminate on September 30, 2020. In the notice, Flextronics stated that it is available to work with us and will continue to supply product during the notice period.\nWe have identified an alternative manufacturer and are currently negotiating a final agreement to allow the transfer of equipment from Flextronics to the alternative manufacturer and the qualification of the transferred process by the FDA. However, unless and until we transition to a replacement manufacturer, there can be no assurances that manufacturing of the affected parts will be performed timely and effectively or that we will be able to transition to a new manufacturer in a timely and effective manner. Significant disruption in this transition, or unanticipated costs related to the transition, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to transition manufacturing to a new vendor in a timely fashion or without disruption to our operations,\nwe could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows, and results of operations.\nMaterials necessary to manufacture ILUVIEN may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase materials from third-party suppliers necessary to produce ILUVIEN. Suppliers may not sell these materials to our manufacturers when needed or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of our manufacturers\u2019 acquisition of these materials. If our manufacturers are unable to obtain these materials in sufficient amounts, our sales of ILUVIEN would be hampered or there would be a shortage in supply, which would materially affect our ability to generate the revenues from the sale of ILUVIEN that we expect. Moreover, although we have agreements with our suppliers for the commercial production of the ILUVIEN implant, the commercial production of the ILUVIEN applicator and the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ILUVIEN, the suppliers may be unable to meet their contractual or quality requirements or choose not to supply us in a timely manner or in the minimum guaranteed quantities. (See the previous risk factor.) If our manufacturers are unable to obtain these essential supplies, their ability to manufacture ILUVIEN and thus our supply of ILUVIEN for sale would be delayed, which could significantly reduce our sales of ILUVIEN and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on the commercial success of our only product, ILUVIEN, which in the near term will depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully commercialize ILUVIEN on our own in the countries where we sell direct, and on our distributors\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize ILUVIEN in other countries.\nWe are a pharmaceutical company with only one product available for commercial sale in a limited number of markets. Because we do not currently have any products or product candidates available for sale or in clinical development other than ILUVIEN, our future success depends on our and our distributors\u2019 successful commercialization of ILUVIEN.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses:\n\u2022\nto continue to support our sales efforts in the U.S., Germany, Ireland, Portugal and the U.K.,\n\u2022\nto pursue the regulatory and reimbursement approval for ILUVIEN in other countries for both DME and NIU-PS and\n\u2022\nto grow our operational capabilities.\nThese investments represent a significant investment in the commercial and regulatory success of ILUVIEN, which is uncertain.\nIf we or our distributors do not successfully maintain our sales in countries where we are approved to sell ILUVIEN or our distributors do not successfully commence and grow our sales of ILUVIEN in other countries where we are seeking to begin selling ILUVIEN or have recently done so, our business may be seriously harmed. In addition, we may experience delays and unforeseen difficulties in the commercialization of ILUVIEN, including unfavorable pricing or reimbursement levels in certain countries that could negatively affect our ability to increase revenues.\nOur existing cash may be inadequate to fund our operations and support our growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Whether this amount will be sufficient to fund our operations and support our growth will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, and we may need capital to fund our operations and support our growth sooner than we might anticipate. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe level of continued success of the commercialization of ILUVIEN in the U.S., and in our international markets,\n\u2022\nexpenses relating to the commercialization of ILUVIEN;\n\u2022\nour research, development and general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nthe timing of approvals, if any, of ILUVIEN for additional indications or in additional jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we enter into, maintain and derive revenues from licensing agreements, including agreements to license ILUVIEN in additional countries or regions; research and other collaborations; joint ventures; and other business arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire, and our success in integrating, technologies or companies;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes and technological developments in our markets; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we can manage the use of cash in our business operations.\nIf we need additional capital to fund our operations and support our growth and we are unable to obtain that capital as noted below, our business may suffer.\nThe terms of our Loan and Security Agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. (Solar Capital) require us to meet certain operating covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur Loan and Security Agreement with Solar Capital (the Solar Loan Agreement), which we entered into on December 31, 2019, contains certain operating covenants and restricts our operating and financial flexibility. The Solar Loan Agreement is secured by a lien covering all of our U.S. assets (and certain ownership interests in one of our foreign subsidiaries), other than our intellectual property. The Solar Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Affirmative covenants include covenants requiring us to comply with applicable laws, maintain our legal existence, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. Negative covenants restrict our ability to transfer any part of our business or property, to change our business or key management, to incur additional indebtedness, to engage in mergers or acquisitions, to pay dividends or make other distributions, to make investments, to create other liens on our assets and to allow revenues from the sale of ILUVIEN to fall below certain minimums, in each case subject to customary exceptions.\nIf an event of default under our Solar Loan Agreement occurs, Solar Capital may accelerate all of our repayment obligations and take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to raise additional financing, renegotiate the Solar Loan Agreement on terms less favorable to us or immediately cease operations. Any declaration by Solar Capital of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly after we publicly disclose that event in an SEC filing. Further, if we are liquidated, Solar Capital\u2019s right to repayment would be senior to the rights of our stockholders.\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAn outbreak of a new respiratory illness caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has resulted in tens of thousands of infections in China and continues to spread, including to the United States and Europe, the major markets in which we operate. The outbreak of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Its effects could include disruptions from temporary hospital and clinic closures, disruptions in our ability to market and distribute ILUVIEN, deferral of ILUVIEN procedures as COVID-19 treatment and containment is prioritized, illness and quarantine of our personnel and restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to travel. For example, in Italy, sales representatives, medical science liaisons and others are currently restricted from entering hospitals to make sales calls. COVID-19 could also result in social, economic and labor instability in the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate.\nILUVIEN is manufactured and assembled in Mexico and the U.S. and we do not currently source components of ILUVIEN directly from China. We have four third-party manufacturers in our supply chain, each of which performs an essential task in the manufacture and testing of ILUVIEN. We do not currently have alternate providers for any of these tasks. If workers at one or more of these facilities become ill or are quarantined and in either or both events are therefore unable to work, our manufacturing operations could be subject to disruption. Further, if our manufacturers become unable to obtain necessary raw materials or components, we may incur higher supply costs or our manufacturers may be required to reduce production levels, either of which may negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the effects of COVID-19 cause our revenue to be reduced below the minimum we are required to maintain under a covenant in our Solar Loan Agreement, we could suffer a default under that agreement, which could have the effects described above under the heading \u201cThe terms of our Loan and Security Agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. (Solar Capital) require us to meet certain operating covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\u201d\nThe extent to which COVID-19 affects our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its effect, among others.\nRegulatory agencies may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which ILUVIEN may be marketed, which would be adverse to our business.\nRegulatory agencies generally approve products for particular indications, or the conditions that make a particular treatment or procedure advisable. If a regulatory agency approves ILUVIEN for a limited indication, the size of our potential market for ILUVIEN will be reduced. ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization in numerous countries in the EEA and elsewhere in the world for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. In the U.S., Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, the indication\nfor ILUVIEN is different, as ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure. Either of these indications or future indications may limit the use of ILUVIEN to a narrower segment of the DME population than we believe is warranted. As a result, our potential revenues are now and may be in the future less that they would be with broader indications for ILUVIEN.\nThe manufacture and packaging of pharmaceutical products such as ILUVIEN are subject to the requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory entities. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy these requirements, our product development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.\nThe FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies regulate the manufacture and packaging of pharmaceutical products such as ILUVIEN, which must be conducted in accordance with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and comparable requirements of foreign regulatory agencies. Only a limited number of manufacturers that operate under these cGMP regulations are both capable of manufacturing ILUVIEN and willing to do so. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, requirements or guidelines, the regulatory agencies could refuse to grant marketing approval of ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates and could impose sanctions on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. Failure of our manufacturers to maintain compliance could interrupt the production of ILUVIEN, resulting in delays and additional costs that could significantly and adversely affect our business. Any significant delays in the manufacture of ILUVIEN or issues with the quality of the product could materially harm our business and prospects.\nChanges in certain aspects of the manufacturing process or procedures require prior FDA review or approval of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations. There are comparable foreign requirements as well. This review may be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a product. If we elect to manufacture products at another facility or are required to do so (as is the case with Flextronics as noted above), we will transfer the manufacturing to a registered medical device manufacturing company to seek to ensure that the new facility and the manufacturing process comply with cGMP and comparable foreign regulations. Any such new facility would also be subject to inspection. In addition, we would be required to demonstrate by physical and chemical methods, which are costly and time consuming, that the product made at any new facility is equivalent to the product made at the former facility. The FDA or a foreign regulatory agency may require clinical testing to prove equivalency of the product manufactured at any new facility compared to the old facility, which would result in additional costs and delay.\nFurther, we are required to complete testing on both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and on the finished product in the packaging that we propose for commercial sales. This includes testing of stability, identification of impurities and testing of other product specifications by validated test methods. In addition, our manufacturers are required to consistently produce our product in commercial quantities and of specified quality in a reproducible manner and document their ability to do so. This requirement is referred to as process validation. The FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards and requirements, for the manufacture, packaging, or testing of products at any time.\nILUVIEN and any future products or product candidates may not remain commercially viable in the U.S. if we fail to obtain or maintain an adequate level of reimbursement for these products from any of the following: private insurers, the Medicare and Medicaid programs or other third-party payers.\nOur revenue from sales of ILUVIEN in the U.S. depends on our ability to maintain pricing and reimbursement guidelines at our desired levels. Those guidelines, however, may fall well below our current expectations. The same could also occur for any future products or product candidates we may develop that receive approval, if any.\nOur list pricing in the U.S. for ILUVIEN is based upon the burden of diabetic macular edema (DME), the current pricing of approved therapies for DME, our perception of the overall cost to benefit ratio of ILUVIEN and the current pricing of other therapies. Due to numerous factors beyond our control, including efforts to provide for containment of health care costs, the U.S. may not support our current level of governmental pricing and reimbursement for ILUVIEN, which would reduce our anticipated revenue from ILUVIEN.\nIn the U.S., the Medicare and Medicaid programs currently provide reimbursement for ILUVIEN, but the reimbursement amount for ILUVIEN could be modified in the future, and the types of patients for whom ILUVIEN is reimbursed could be reduced to a smaller subset of patients. In addition, in some states, Medicare reimburses physicians for less than the cost of ILUVIEN. In recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. Comprehensive reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were recently enacted, including changes to the methods for, and amounts of, Medicare reimbursement. The current presidential\nadministration and Congress have indicated they may further reform the Medicare program and the U.S. healthcare system, but they have not made any definitive proposals that allow us to gauge the impact of such potential reforms, if any, on our business and operations. Some of these changes and proposed changes and reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for ILUVIEN and our future product candidates, which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. Our business could also be adversely affected if retinal specialists are not reimbursed for the cost of the procedure in which they administer ILUVIEN at a level that is satisfactory to them. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare carrier level or by fiscal intermediaries. Our business could be materially adversely affected if the Medicare program, local Medicare carriers or fiscal intermediaries were to make such a determination and deny or limit the reimbursement of ILUVIEN. If the local contractors that administer the Medicare program are slow to reimburse retinal specialists for ILUVIEN, that delay could ultimately affect the timing of payments to us, which would in turn adversely affect our working capital.\nIn the U.S., almost all private insurers, including managed care organizations, have agreed to reimburse for ILUVIEN, but the reimbursement amount could be modified in the future, and the types of patients for whom ILUVIEN is reimbursed could be reduced to a smaller subset of patients. We expect that private insurers will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of ILUVIEN in determining whether to maintain approval for reimbursement for ILUVIEN in the U.S. and at what level. Maintaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not maintain approval for reimbursement of ILUVIEN from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis or such approvals are changed to reduce the level of reimbursements.\nWe may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of ILUVIEN due to the potential healthcare reforms discussed above, as well as the trend toward programs aimed at reducing health care costs, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative proposals and the economic health of the U.S. economy. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable, limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nILUVIEN and any future products or product candidates may not be commercially viable in the European Economic Area if we fail to obtain or maintain an adequate level of reimbursement for these products from any of the following: governments, private insurers or other third-party payers.\nIn the EEA, each country has a different reviewing body that evaluates reimbursement dossiers submitted by marketing authorization holders of new drugs and then makes recommendations as to whether or not the drug should be reimbursed. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval. For example, in February 2017 we announced that the Italian government had published a change in the reimbursement status of ILUVIEN, allowing ILUVIEN to be hospital-administered and that ILUVIEN should be fully reimbursed for pseudophakic patients. The negotiation for this reimbursement change took more than 15 months. In some countries, to obtain reimbursement approval or pricing approval at a level that we believe is appropriate, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of ILUVIEN to other available therapies. Limitations on reimbursement could be imposed at the national, regional or local level or by fiscal intermediaries in each country, either through the initial authorization process or at some point in the future.\nIn addition, due to price referencing within the EEA and certain other countries, existing pricing in our current markets could be negatively affected by a change in pricing in a country where we currently have reimbursement approval or by a new price in a country where we obtain reimbursement approval in the future. For example, in 2019 we gained pricing approval in France that is lower than our current established price in Portugal. Consequently, the Portuguese government reduced the published price for ILUVIEN. Such cross-border price referencing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could also be adversely affected if governments, private insurers or other reimbursing bodies or payers (a) limit the indications for reimbursement approval to a smaller subset than we believe ILUVIEN is effective in treating or (b) establish a limit on the frequency with which ILUVIEN may be administered that is less often than we believe would be effective. (An \u201cindication\u201d is a condition that makes a particular treatment or procedure advisable.) Those actions could limit our revenues and harm our business.\nFailure to comply with government regulations regarding the sale and marketing of our products could harm our business.\nOur and our distribution partners\u2019 activities, including the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, including regulation under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes, along with requirements in Europe, such as the Medicines Act of 1968 in the U.K. In the U.S., we are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to purchase or arrange for or recommend the purchase\nof healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws may apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of drugs by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of drugs. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial, including the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).\nPharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Federal False Claim Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other violations in connection with off-label promotion of products and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement and claims under state laws, including state anti-kickback and fraud laws. In Europe, each country has different regulations that govern the promotional claims and activities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The violation and enforcement of these regulations by each country may result in heavy fines, further legal action, public reprimand, injunction and may include the loss of market authorization.\nWhile we have implemented a compliance program to assist with monitoring and complying with these activities and we strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing practices are ever evolving. If any such actions are instituted against us or our partners and we or they are not successful in defending those actions or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant and material adverse effect on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to successfully manage our international operations, our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nOur international operations require significant management attention and financial resources. In addition, there are many risks inherent in international business activities, including:\n\u2022\nextended collection timelines for accounts receivable and greater working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nmultiple legal systems and unexpected changes in legal requirements;\n\u2022\ntariffs, export restrictions, trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\ntrade laws and business practices favoring local competition;\n\u2022\npotential tax issues, including restrictions on repatriating earnings, resulting from multiple, conflicting and complex tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nweaker intellectual property protection in some countries;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, including war and terrorism or the threat of war and terrorism; and\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions, including the stability and solvency of business financial markets, financial institutions and sovereign nations.\nIn addition, compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions, and our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, partners and other persons with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or these laws. Any violations of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially and adversely harm our business and financial condition.\nMaintaining our commercial infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial and managerial resources, and we may not be successful in our efforts or we may experience difficulties with these efforts. We\nmay also encounter unexpected or unforeseen challenges, which may negatively affect our commercial efforts for ILUVIEN.\nWe anticipate that in the near term our ability to generate revenues will depend almost entirely on our ability to continue the successful commercialization of ILUVIEN. We launched ILUVIEN in Germany and the U.K. in 2013, and in the U.S. and Portugal in 2015. We launched ILUVIEN in Ireland and Austria in 2017. A commercial launch of this size is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial and managerial resources. We anticipate that our distributors in Italy, the Middle East, Spain and France will continue to generate revenues for us in 2020, if they are able to continue to successfully commercialize ILUVIEN in those territories.\nAs of January 31, 2020, we had 120 employees. As our commercialization plans and strategies evolve, we will need to further expand the size of our organization by recruiting additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel.\nWe may not be able to maintain and expand our commercial operation in a cost-effective manner or realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of ophthalmologists to prescribe our products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products or additional labeled indications for ILUVIEN to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating a commercial organization.\nIf we are not successful in recruiting and retaining sales and marketing personnel or in maintaining our sales and marketing infrastructure or if we do not successfully enter into additional collaboration arrangements with third parties, we will have difficulty commercializing ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In the first six months of 2019, our revenues in the U.S. market were negatively affected by a competitor\u2019s hiring some of our key sales personnel.\nAdditionally, we may encounter unexpected or unforeseen delays in expanding our commercial operations that delay the commercial launch in one or more countries in which ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization. These delays may increase the cost of and the resources required for successful commercialization of ILUVIEN. Further, a delay in the commercial launch of ILUVIEN could result in the withdrawal of our marketing or regulatory authorization for ILUVIEN in certain jurisdictions, including certain EU member states where ILUVIEN has already received marketing authorization.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license development or commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are material to our business.\nOur licenses are material to our business, and we may enter into additional licenses in the future. We hold a license from EyePoint to intellectual property relating to ILUVIEN. Our ability to pursue the development and commercialization of ILUVIEN depends upon the continuation of our license from EyePoint. This license imposes various commercialization, milestone payment, royalty payments, insurance and other obligations on us, including the right by EyePoint to audit. If we fail to comply with these obligations, EyePoint may have the right to terminate the license. Our license rights to EyePoint\u2019s proprietary insert technology could revert to EyePoint if we:\n(a)\nfail twice to cure our breach of an obligation to make certain payments to EyePoint following receipt of written notice of the breach;\n(b)\nfail to cure other breaches of material terms of our agreement with EyePoint within 30 days after notice of such breaches or such longer period (up to 90 days) as may be reasonably necessary if the breach cannot be cured within such 30-day period;\n(c)\nfile for protection under the bankruptcy laws, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, appoint or suffer appointment of a receiver or trustee over our property, file a petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency act or have any such petition filed against us and such proceeding remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than 60 days; or\n(d)\nnotify EyePoint in writing of our decision to abandon our license with respect to a certain product using EyePoint\u2019s proprietary delivery device.\nIf our license with EyePoint, or any other current or future material license agreement, were terminated, we would be unable to market the applicable products, such as ILUVIEN, that may be covered by such license, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and future prospects.\nRegulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the regulatory authorities to those specific indications for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities in Europe. In addition to approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires regulatory approval. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our opportunity for future growth could be limited.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by regulatory authority. These \u201coff-label\u201d uses by physicians are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in some circumstances. Regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do restrict, however, communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow regulatory authority rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the regulatory authority to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market in the applicable country, require a recall or payment of fines, or impose sanctions that could include disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive, and the commercial success of ILUVIEN or any of our future products or product candidates will depend on several factors, including our ability to differentiate ILUVIEN or any of our future products or product candidates from our competitors\u2019 current or future products. We will face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to ILUVIEN and to any future products or product candidates that we may develop or commercialize in the future.\nOur commercial opportunities for ILUVIEN will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products that:\n\u2022\nare more effective;\n\u2022\nreceive better reimbursement terms;\n\u2022\nhave higher rates of acceptance by physicians;\n\u2022\nhave fewer or less severe adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nare better tolerated;\n\u2022\nare more adaptable to various modes of dosing;\n\u2022\nhave better distribution channels;\n\u2022\nare easier to administer; or\n\u2022\nare less expensive, including a generic version of ILUVIEN.\nMany pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products, some of which may target the same indications as ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates. Our competitors include larger, more established, fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that have substantially greater capital resources, existing competitive products, larger research and development staffs and facilities, greater experience in drug development and in\nobtaining regulatory approvals and greater marketing capabilities than we do. Each of Genentech, Novartis, Regeneron, Allergan, and Abbvie provides a short-term therapy that competes with ILUVIEN.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to expand our portfolio of ophthalmic products.\nIn the future, we may choose to commercialize a portfolio of new ophthalmic drugs in addition to ILUVIEN. We may seek to do so through our internal research programs and through licensing or otherwise acquiring the rights to potential new products and future product candidates for the treatment of ophthalmic disease.\nA significant portion of the research that we may choose to conduct may involve new and unproven technologies. Research programs to identify new disease targets and product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not we ultimately identify any candidates. Any future research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential products or product candidates, yet fail to yield products or product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential products or product candidates; or\n\u2022\nwe may learn after further study that potential products or product candidates have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to be effective drugs.\nWe may be unable to license or acquire suitable products or product candidates or products from third parties for a number of reasons. In particular, the licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. Several more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products in the ophthalmic field. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater development and commercialization capabilities. Other factors that may prevent us from licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable products or product candidates include the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to license or acquire the relevant technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return from the product;\n\u2022\nwe may need to obtain our lender\u2019s consent to any significant payment or potential payment in conjunction with a license of acquisition of technology;\n\u2022\ncompanies that perceive us to be their competitors may be unwilling to assign or license their product rights to us; or\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify suitable products or product candidates within our areas of expertise.\nAdditionally, it may take greater human and financial resources to develop suitable potential products or product candidates through internal research programs or by obtaining rights than we will possess, thereby limiting our ability to develop a diverse product portfolio.\nIf we are unable to develop suitable potential product candidates through internal research programs or by obtaining rights to novel therapeutics from third parties, opportunity for future growth could be limited.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of those acquisitions or alliances.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, including adding new products in the ophthalmic field. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or ophthalmic products, we may be unable to realize the benefit of acquiring those businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing and marketing the ophthalmic products of a newly acquired company that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize value from expected synergies. We cannot assure that, following an acquisition, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies the acquisition.\nIf we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, it will impair our ability to identify, develop and commercialize ILUVIEN and any future products or product candidates.\nWe depend on the principal members of our management team, including Richard S. Eiswirth, Jr., our President and Chief Executive Officer, Philip Ashman, Ph.D., our Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President Commercial Operations Europe, J. Philip Jones, our Chief Financial Officer, David Holland, our Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President Corporate Communications and Managed Markets, and Dr. Samer Kaba, Chief Medical Officer. These executives have significant ophthalmic, regulatory industry, sales and marketing, operational and/or corporate finance experience. The loss of any such executives or any other principal member of our management team may impair our ability to identify, develop and market ILUVIEN and any future ophthalmic products or product candidates.\nIn addition, our growth will require us to hire a significant number of qualified technical, commercial and administrative personnel. We face intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for the qualified personnel we need in our business. If we cannot continue to attract and retain, on acceptable terms, the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain or grow our operations.\nWe have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception and may continue to incur losses.\nTo date we have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations, and we have accumulated a deficit of $387,570,000 from our inception through December 31, 2019. Our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow depends on our ability to maintain revenue and contain our expenses. However, ILUVIEN is our only product currently approved for commercial sale, and as a result, we are uncertain if we will achieve profitability and, if so, whether we will be able to sustain it. Our ability to maintain revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability to continue to successfully market and sell ILUVIEN in the geographic areas where we or our distributors sell ILUVIEN. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully commercialize ILUVIEN or future products or product candidates. Failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nOur recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In that regard, the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm for the audit of our 2019 financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThere is no assurance that sufficient financing will be available to us when needed to allow us to continue as a going concern. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations.\nOur quarterly operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results and cash flows to continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. The revenues we generate and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe ongoing commercial success of ILUVIEN (or lack thereof);\n\u2022\ninconsistent timing and ordering patterns from our U.S. distributors;\n\u2022\nseasonality caused by insurance renewals for patients in the U.S. and by doctor and or patient absences due to holidays and vacations;\n\u2022\nsales, marketing and medical affairs expenses;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of royalties, milestone payments or product purchases by our distributors;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approval of ILUVIEN in additional jurisdictions or for additional indications;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting ILUVIEN, our future product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of products or treatments that compete with ILUVIEN;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our products or future development programs;\n\u2022\nthe status of our clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nour execution of collaborative, licensing or other arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nany lawsuit or intellectual property infringement in which we are or may become involved; and\n\u2022\nthe timing and recognition of stock-based compensation expense.\nIf our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any fluctuations in our operating results or cash flows may, in turn, cause significant volatility in the price of our stock. We believe that comparisons of our quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nExchange rate fluctuations of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could materially and adversely affect our business.\nA substantial majority of our international revenues and expenses are denominated in British Pounds and Euros, and as such are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. We also have balances, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accruals that are denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign currency transactions and balances are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates of the British Pound and Euro in relation to the U.S. Dollar could materially reduce our future revenues as compared to prior periods. We do not seek to mitigate this exchange rate effect by using derivative financial instruments. To the extent we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in that currency could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards of approximately $125.8 million and $173.0 million, respectively, which expire at various dates beginning in 2020 through 2039, subject to further limitation based upon the final results of our Internal Revenue Code sections 382 and 383 analyses. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code limit the annual use of NOL carry-forwards and tax credit carry-forwards, respectively, following an ownership change. NOL carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitations under Section 382 (or comparable provisions of state law) if certain changes in ownership of our company were to occur. In general, an ownership change occurs for purposes of Section 382 if there is a more than 50% change in ownership of a company over a 3-year testing period. We have determined that a Section 382 change in ownership occurred in December of 2015. As a result of this change in ownership, we estimated that approximately $18.6 million of our federal NOLs and approximately $382,000 of federal tax credits generated prior to the change in ownership will not be utilized in the future. We are currently in the process of refining and finalizing these calculations, and upon finalization, will determine if a write-off is necessary. The reduction to our NOL deferred tax asset due to the annual Section 382 limitation and the NOL carryforward period would result in an offsetting reduction in valuation allowance recorded against the NOL deferred tax asset. Therefore, the limitation does not affect the statements of operations for the periods presented. Any future changes in our ownership or sale of our stock could further limit the use of our NOLs in the future. If we need to obtain alternative or additional financing to meet our liquidity requirements under our 2019 Solar Loan Agreement and we raise those funds by selling additional equity, this could further limit the use of our NOLs in the future.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to comply with various securities laws and regulations and Nasdaq listing requirements.\nAs a public company, we incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, has imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel are required to devote a substantial amount of time to legal compliance.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404), we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 requires us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group. Moreover, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or if we identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nIf the interpretations, estimates or judgments we use to prepare our financial statements prove to be incorrect, we may be required to restate our financial results, which could have a number of material adverse effects on us.\nWe are also subject to complex tax laws, regulations, accounting principles and interpretations thereof. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to interpret accounting principles and guidance and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. We base our interpretations, estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the preparation of our financial statements. Generally accepted accounting principles presentation is subject to interpretation by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. If one of these bodies disagrees with our accounting recognition, measurement or disclosure or any of our accounting interpretations, estimates or assumptions, it may have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. Any restatement of our financial results could, among other potential adverse effects:\n\u2022\nresult in us incurring substantial costs,\n\u2022\naffect our ability to timely file our periodic reports until the restatement is completed,\n\u2022\ndivert the attention of our management and employees from managing our business,\n\u2022\nresult in material changes to our historical and future financial results,\n\u2022\nresult in investors losing confidence in our operating results,\n\u2022\nsubject us to securities class action litigation, and\n\u2022\ncause our stock price to decline.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, reduce the commercial potential of our products and result in substantial liabilities, which insurance may not cover.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims, which is inherent in the manufacturing, testing and marketing of drugs and related products. We face an increased risk of product liability as we further commercialize ILUVIEN, especially in the U.S. If the use of ILUVIEN or one or more of our future products causes physical harm, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. We believe that we may be at a greater risk of product liability claims relative to other pharmaceutical companies because ILUVIEN is inserted into the eye, and it is possible that we may be held liable for eye injuries of patients who receive ILUVIEN. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forego further commercialization of ILUVIEN or one or more of our future products. Even if we are not held liable, product liability lawsuits could cause adverse publicity and decrease the demand for ILUVIEN, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations and financial condition. To date we have not had any material claims against us.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance covering our clinical trial activities and our product sales, our aggregate coverage limit under these insurance policies is limited to $10 million in most jurisdictions, and while we believe this amount of insurance is sufficient to cover our product liability exposure, these limits may not be high enough to fully cover potential liabilities. The insurance provides worldwide coverage where allowed by law. As we generate product revenue in new countries, we intend to obtain compulsory coverage in those countries that require it. However, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims. If\nwe are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product development and commercialization efforts.\nOur internal information technology systems, or those of our third-party contract research organizations (CROs) or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, loss or leakage of data and other disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of certain parts of our business, compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\nWe depend on information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. We must maintain the confidentiality and integrity of that confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we work with a number of third-party contractors that have access to some of our confidential information.\nAlthough we have implemented security, backup and recovery measures, our internal information technology systems and those of our third-party manufacturers, CROs and other contractors or consultants are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\nservice interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners or other third parties, and\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks by malicious third parties, including cyber-related threats of spoofed or manipulated electronic communications that lead to misdirected or fraudulent payments, the deployment of harmful malware or ransomware, malicious websites, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering and other means to adversely affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.\nAny of the foregoing may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage.\nWhile we have not experienced any such cyber-related fraud, system failure, accident or security breach to date that has materially affected our business, we cannot assure that our and our vendors\u2019 data protection efforts and our and our vendors\u2019 investment in information technology will prevent cyber-attacks by malicious third parties, significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or a direct financial loss due to misdirected or fraudulent payments, it could result in a material disruption of our business operations, including, distribution and manufacturing, or to a direct financial loss.\nFor example, we sell ILUVIEN in the U.S. primarily to two distributors and in Europe use two logistics providers, and a security breach that impairs these distribution or logistics operations could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers. In addition, ILUVIEN is manufactured and tested by third parties, and a security breach that impairs these third parties could significantly impair our ability to manufacture ILUVIEN and deliver it to our distributors in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that our or their efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks or breaches of systems, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive data, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or impact our stock price.\nIn addition, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates or our post-market studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Furthermore, significant disruptions or security breaches of our internal information technology systems or our vendors\u2019 technology systems could adversely affect or result in the loss of, misappropriation of, unauthorized access to, use of, disclosure of or the prevention of access to our confidential information, including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of our employees and patients in studies conducted on our behalf, which could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access to, use of or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our employees or information we may have regarding patients, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur operations may produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our procedures for use, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, even if we comply with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProlonged economic uncertainties or downturns, as well as unstable market, credit and financial conditions, may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business and have serious adverse consequences on our business.\nEconomic conditions, and uncertainty as to the general direction of the macroeconomic environment, are beyond our control. Sales of our products will depend, in large part, on reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, distribution partners and other organizations in the U.S., Germany, Portugal and the U.K. and other countries. Negative trends in the general economy in any of the jurisdictions in which we may do business may cause these organizations to be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or to delay payment. In addition, health authorities in some jurisdictions may reduce reimbursements, and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales and revenue.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or partners. If those third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. We sell to two large pharmaceutical distributors in the U.S. and they accounted for 60% and 69% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe term loan under our Solar Loan Agreement matures on July 1, 2024, and our interest rate is based on LIBOR. As a result, we are exposed to the risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR by the anticipated January 1, 2022 deadline.\nThe term loan under our Solar Loan Agreement matures on July 1, 2024, and our interest rate is based on LIBOR, which is expected to be discontinued by January 1, 2022. LIBOR may be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, or other benchmark rates over the next several years. The 2019 Solar Loan Agreement includes fallback language that seeks to facilitate an agreement with our lenders on a replacement rate for LIBOR in the event of its discontinuance. We cannot predict what reference rate would be agreed upon or what the impact of any such replacement rate would be to our interest expense, but such changes could result in increased interest expense on our 2019 Solar Loan, and increased borrowing costs in the future. Although the impact is uncertain at this time, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe U.K.\u2019s leaving the EU, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union (Brexit). The U.K. formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2020. The process of preparing for Brexit has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years, even though the U.K. has now left the EU. Our business in the U.K., the EU and in other parts of the world could be adversely affected by Brexit in many ways, only some of which we can identify.\nWe currently operate in Europe through two subsidiary companies, one based in the U.K. and the other based in the Republic of Ireland. The two subsidiary companies work very closely to cover our operations in Europe as a whole, which provides us with certain operational and other benefits when conducting business in the EU. Nevertheless, the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU could adversely affect our ability to realize those benefits, and we may incur costs and suffer disruptions in our European operations as a result, including changing our base of operations or part of our operations from the U.K. to another country in the EU.\nBrexit may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including in global currency and debt markets. This volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., Europe or globally, which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. Our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between\nthe U.K. and other countries, including the U.S., and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the U.K. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the U.K.\u2019s actual withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nThe regulatory approval of ILUVIEN in any additional countries is uncertain, and our regulatory approval in certain countries is contingent on our ability to sell ILUVIEN in an appropriate time frame. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in additional foreign jurisdictions or maintain regulatory approval in jurisdictions where we have received regulatory approval but have not yet sold ILUVIEN would prevent us from marketing and commercializing ILUVIEN in additional markets, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nILUVIEN has received marketing authorization in the U.S., in numerous other countries in Europe and in other places in the world as described above in \u201cBusiness - Overview.\u201d We sell ILUVIEN directly in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Portugal, Ireland and Austria. Our distributors will continue to sell ILUVIEN in France, Italy and Spain in 2020. When we received marketing authorization in the remaining countries in the EEA, those marketing authorizations required that we sell at least one ILUVIEN in those countries within three years or our license in those countries could be revoked unless we negotiate to extend the deadline. We intend to either sell one ILUVIEN in each of those countries or negotiate to extend the deadline, but we may not be able to make such a sale or extend the deadline, in which case our license in that country could be revoked. If our license in any of these countries is revoked, we will need to pursue marketing authorization again for that country, and we may be unsuccessful in that effort.\nWe intend to continue to pursue market authorizations for ILUVIEN internationally in additional jurisdictions. To market our products in foreign jurisdictions, we will be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. We may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize ILUVIEN in any additional market.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances in jurisdictions where ILUVIEN is not approved will require us to expend substantial time and capital. Despite the time and expense incurred, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. The number of preclinical and clinical tests that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition for which the drug candidate is in development, the jurisdiction in which we are seeking approval and the regulations applicable to that particular drug candidate. Regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including that:\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may interpret data from preclinical and clinical testing in different ways than we do;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may not approve of our manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\na drug candidate may not be safe or effective;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may conclude that the drug candidate does not meet quality standards for stability, quality, purity and potency; and\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nThe applicable regulatory authorities may make requests or suggestions regarding our clinical trials, resulting in an increased risk of difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval. For example, the regulatory authorities may not approve of certain of our methods for analyzing our trial data, including how we evaluate the relationship between risk and benefit. Additionally, the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. For all of these reasons, we may not obtain additional foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER LEGAL MATTERS\nIf we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property incorporated into our products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends largely on our ability or the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain protection in the U.S. and other countries for the intellectual property incorporated into our products. The patent situation in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions. We or our licensors may be unable to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.\nUnder our license with EyePoint, EyePoint controls the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patents. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute or continue to prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed. Even if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against entities that are infringing upon these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we ordinarily would. Without protection for the intellectual property that we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Moreover, FAc is an off-patent active ingredient that is commercially available in several forms, including the extended release ocular implant Retisert.\nEven if issued, patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, our patents and our licensors\u2019 patents may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement would require us to divert resources and may prevent or delay our commercialization of ILUVIEN or the development or regulatory approval of other product candidates.\nILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates may infringe upon other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights that are protected by patents or patent applications. Third parties may now or in the future own or control these patents and patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses or divert substantial employee resources from our business. If those claims are successful, we could be required to pay substantial damages or could be prevented from developing any future product candidates. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay manufacturing, sales, research or development of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nSeveral issued and pending U.S. patents claiming methods and devices for the treatment of eye diseases, including through the use of steroids, implants and injections into the eye, purport to cover aspects of ILUVIEN. For example, one of our potential competitors holds issued and pending U.S. patents and a pending European patent application with claims covering injecting an ocular implant into a patient\u2019s eye similar to the ILUVIEN applicator. There is also an issued U.S. patent with claims covering implanting a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent to treat an inflammation-mediated condition of the eye. If these or any other patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be valid and to cover aspects of ILUVIEN, then the owners of such patents would be able to block our ability to commercialize ILUVIEN unless and until we obtain a license under such patents (which license might require us to pay royalties or grant a cross-license to one or more patents that we own), until those patents expire or unless we are able to redesign our product to avoid any such valid patents.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, or be prevented from commercializing a product if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding, regardless of its merit, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may, regardless of their merit, also absorb significant management time and employee resources.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our products are inadequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nThe strength of our patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. In addition to the rights we have licensed from EyePoint relating to ILUVIEN, we rely upon intellectual property we own, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets. Our patent applications may be challenged or fail to result in issued patents and our existing or future patents may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around these patents. Moreover, it is possible that a third party could successfully challenge the scope (i.e., whether a\npatent is infringed), validity and enforceability of our licensed patents before patent expiration and obtain approval to market a competitive product.\nFurther, the patent applications that we license or have filed may fail to result in issued patents. Patent examiners have rejected some claims in pending patent applications that we have filed or licensed. We may need to amend these claims. Even after amendment, a patent may not be permitted to issue. Further, the existing or future patents to which we have rights based on our agreement with EyePoint may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around these patents. Additionally, we may lose our rights to the patents and patent applications we license in the event of a breach or termination of our license agreement with EyePoint. Manufacturers may also seek to obtain approval to sell a generic version of ILUVIEN before the expiration of the relevant licensed patents. If the sufficiency of the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we license with respect to ILUVIEN or the patents we pursue related to ILUVIEN or any future product candidate is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to commercialize ILUVIEN and develop any future product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials for any future product candidate, the period during which we could market those product candidates under patent protection would be reduced.\nWe may be adversely affected by the expiration of patents that protect key aspects of ILUVIEN in the near- to medium-term.\nThe patent rights relating to ILUVIEN licensed to us from EyePoint include one U.S. patent that expired in March 2019 and six U.S. patents that will expire between April 2020 and August 2027, two European patents that expire in April 2021 and October 2024 and counterpart filings to these patents in a number of other jurisdictions. No patent term extension will be available for any of these U.S. patents, European patents or any of our licensed U.S. or European pending patent applications. After these patents expire in August 2027 in the U.S. and October 2024 in Europe, we will not be able to block others from marketing FAc in an implant similar to ILUVIEN.\nWe rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of our products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in our marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering our products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of our products.\nAs patents for certain of our products expire, we will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If our competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our commercialization efforts with respect to ILUVIEN and our discovery, development or commercialization efforts with respect to any future product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, at least several issued and pending U.S. patents claiming methods and devices for the treatment of eye diseases, including through the use of steroids, implants and injections into the eye, purport to cover aspects of ILUVIEN.\nAlthough we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to ILUVIEN, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may in the future allege that our activities infringe their patents or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. We may not have identified all the patents, patent applications or published literature that could potentially affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates, by preventing the patentability of one or more aspects of our products or those of our licensors or by covering the same or similar technologies that may affect our ability to market our product. We cannot predict whether we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any inability to obtain such a license under the applicable patents on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates until such patents expire.\nIn addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of ILUVIEN, our technologies or future products or product candidates infringes upon these patents. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further commercialize ILUVIEN or develop and commercialize any future product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful\nclaim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties or pay royalties, or we may be enjoined from further commercializing ILUVIEN or developing and commercializing any future product candidates or technologies. In addition, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of ILUVIEN or any future product candidate, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain future licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be unable to further commercialize ILUVIEN or develop and commercialize any future product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect certain proprietary know-how that is not patentable, for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and for any other elements of our development processes with respect to ILUVIEN that involve proprietary know-how, information and technology that is not covered by patent applications. Any involuntary disclosure or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nWe seek to protect confidential or proprietary information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. While we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the U.S. and abroad. If we are unable to protect or defend the intellectual property related to our technologies, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nIf we seek to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms, the terms on which we obtain the capital may restrict our operations and if the capital we raise is equity or a debt security that is convertible into equity, our stockholders\u2019 investment could be diluted.\nFor the reasons described above, we may need to raise alternative or additional financing to fund our operations and support growth. General market conditions or the market price of our common stock may not support capital-raising transactions such as an additional public or private offering of our common stock or other securities. In addition, our ability to raise additional capital may depend on our stock being quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market or upon obtaining stockholder\napproval. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance for continued listing on Nasdaq as we expect, that we will be able to satisfy the criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq in the future or that we will be able to obtain stockholder approval for a capital raise if it is necessary under applicable Nasdaq rules that require capital raises over a certain size to be approved by stockholders. If we need additional financing, we may seek to fund our operations through the sale of equity securities, additional debt financing and strategic collaboration agreements. We cannot be sure that additional financing from any of these sources will be available when needed or that, if available, the additional financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders.\nIf we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted. If we attempt to raise additional funds through strategic collaboration agreements, we may not be successful in obtaining those agreements, or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements. If we raise additional funds by incurring additional debt (assuming Solar Capital would permit such debt, which would be subordinated to the debt outstanding under our Solar Loan Agreement), the terms of the debt may include significant installment payments as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to commercialize ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates or otherwise successfully operate our business.\nWe are currently not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq). We believe that Nasdaq will concur with our view that our revenue and total assets as of December 31, 2019 enable us to regain continued listing compliance. If Nasdaq does not concur with our view, however, our common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market, which could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on its market price.\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Market, which we believe helps support and maintain liquidity for our stock. Companies whose shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Market, however, are subject to various rules and requirements imposed by Nasdaq that a listed company must satisfy to continue having its stock listed on the exchange. We received notice in September 2019 from The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) that, for the last 30 consecutive trading days before the date of the notice, the Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) for our common stock was below the minimum MVLS of $50,000,000 required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. We have not regained compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum MVLS requirement, and our 180-day compliance period expires on March 9, 2020. However, Nasdaq has three alternate standards for continued listing, and we expect to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards by qualifying under a different listing standard that requires a listed company\u2019s revenue and total assets in each case to exceed $50 million (the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard). Based on our revenue and total assets as reflected on the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard. If Nasdaq concurs with our view as we expect, the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq will send us a letter to that effect. We expect the letter to state that we have complied with the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard and therefore our failure to comply with the minimum MVLS requirement will no longer affect our continued listing. We will not be able to confirm that we have regained compliance, however, until we receive a letter to that effect from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq.\nFor our common stock to remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Market, we must meet either (a) the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard, (b) the Market Value Standard (which would require us to meet the minimum MVLS requirement) or (c) the Equity Standard, which is based on stockholders\u2019 equity. Because we currently do not meet the Market Value Standard or the Equity Standard, we can regain compliance in the near future only by complying with the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard. If we were to fail to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, our shares could be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market, which could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on its market price. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the only established trading market for our common stock would be eliminated and we would be forced to list our shares on the OTC Markets or another quotation medium, depending on our ability to meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems. As a result, an investor would likely find it more difficult to trade, or to obtain accurate price quotations for, our shares. Delisting would likely also reduce the visibility, liquidity and value of our common stock, including as a result of reduced institutional investor interest in our company, and may increase the volatility of our common stock. Delisting could also cause a loss of confidence of potential industry partners, lenders and employees, which could further harm our business and our future prospects.\nWe cannot provide any assurances, however, that we will be able to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing standards. Our statements in this risk factor that we expect to regain compliance with the continued listing standards are forward-looking statements. We may not regain compliance, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Meaningful factors that could cause actual results to differ include our inability to meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard as interpreted by Nasdaq.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors or other unforeseen risks could have a dramatic and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and those that are summarized in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections.\u201d\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various regulatory, scientific, clinical and other product development goals or milestones. These milestones may include:\n\u2022\nthe submission of regulatory filings,\n\u2022\nthe notification of the results of regulatory filings,\n\u2022\nthe anticipated commercial launch of ILUVIEN in various new jurisdictions or for new or expanded indications,\n\u2022\nany future products or product candidates and\n\u2022\nthe commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials.\nAlso, from time to time, we expect that we will publicly announce the anticipated timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, our stock price may decline and the further commercialization of ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates may be delayed.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies, including us. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against these companies. This litigation, if brought against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nHolders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders.\nThe terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide that certain corporate actions require the prior consent of the holders of at least 70% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result, there may be actions that management and the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting power may approve but that the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may elect to block.\nSignificant sales of our common stock could depress or reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our shares of common stock to trade below the prices at which they would otherwise trade, or impede our ability to raise future capital.\nA small number of institutional investors and private equity funds hold a significant number of shares of our common stock and all of our shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. Sales by these stockholders of a substantial number of common shares, or the expectation of such sales, could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nWe may sell our shares in registered public offerings. For example, in August 2016, we sold an aggregate of 18,900,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.40 each, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $26.5 million, before deducting underwriting fees, commissions and offering expenses.\nWe also may elect to sell shares of our common stock through an at-the-market offering. Any sale of additional shares of common stock in the future, if we determined it was appropriate or necessary to do so, could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition to our outstanding common stock, as of December 31, 2019, we were obligated to issue: (a) a total of 871,472 shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding common stock options (b) a total of 36,763 shares of common stock\nupon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs); and (c) a total of 119,712 shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding common stock warrants. Upon the exercise of the stock options and vesting of the RSUs in accordance with their respective terms, the shares so acquired may be resold freely, subject to restrictions imposed on our affiliates under the SEC\u2019s Rule 144. The shares acquired upon exercise of warrants can be sold under Rule 144. If significant sales of these shares occur in short periods, these sales could reduce the market price of our common stock. Any reduction in the trading price of our common stock could impede our ability to raise capital on attractive terms.\nActual or perceived significant sales of our common stock could depress or reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our shares of common stock to trade below the prices at which they would otherwise trade or impede our ability to raise future capital.\nFuture sales and issuances of our equity securities or rights to purchase our equity securities, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, would result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities; our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, whether in public or private offerings, investors may be diluted by subsequent sales. Those sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders. In addition, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to price-based anti-dilution protection in connection with certain financings, which has the potential to further dilute our other stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, our board of directors is authorized to grant various types of equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, to our employees, directors and consultants. As of January 1, 2020, a total of 464,561 shares of our common stock were available for issuance under new awards granted under our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock contains covenants that may limit our business flexibility.\nFor so long as at least 37.5% of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock originally issued to the investors at the closing of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock financing in October 2012 are held by the initial investors or their affiliates, we may not, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of at least 70% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock:\n\u2022\nincrease or decrease the authorized number of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nauthorize, create, issue or obligate us to issue (by reclassification, merger or otherwise) any security (or any class or series thereof) or any indebtedness, in each case that has any rights, preferences or privileges senior to, or on a parity with, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or any security convertible into or exercisable for any such security or indebtedness, subject to limited exceptions for certain debt transactions;\n\u2022\namend our certificate of incorporation or the certificate of designation of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case in a manner that adversely affects the rights, preference or privileges of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nredeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set aside for a sinking fund for such purpose) any shares of common stock or preferred stock; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to (A) the redemption of rights issued pursuant to any \u201cpoison pill\u201d rights plan or similar plan we adopt in the future or (B) the repurchases of stock from former employees, officers, directors or consultants who performed services for us in connection with the cessation of such employment or service pursuant to the terms of existing agreements with such individuals;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay any dividend or distribution on any shares of capital stock; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to (A) dividends payable to holders of common stock that consist solely of shares of common stock for which adjustment to the conversion price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is made pursuant to the certificate of designation or (B) dividends or distributions issued pro rata to all holders of capital stock (on an as-converted basis) in connection with our implementation of a \u201cpoison pill\u201d rights plan or similar plan;\n\u2022\nauthorize or approve any increase to the number of aggregate shares of capital stock reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option, stock purchase plans or other equity incentive plans such that the total aggregate number of shares issued under such plans and reserved for issuance under such plans (on an as-converted basis)\nexceeds the number of shares issued and reserved for issuance under such plans (on an as-converted basis) on the date of the closing of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock financing by more than 20% (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like);\n\u2022\nissue stock or other equity securities of any subsidiary (other than to us or another of our wholly-owned subsidiaries);\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay any dividend or other distribution of cash, shares or other assets or redemption or repurchase of shares of any subsidiary; or\n\u2022\nincur any secured indebtedness other than certain limited debt transactions.\nThere is no guarantee that the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would approve any such restricted action, even where such an action would be in the best interests of our stockholders. Any failure to obtain such approval could harm our business and result in a decrease in the value of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and in Delaware law could prevent or delay acquisition bids for us that stockholders might consider favorable and could entrench current management.\nWe are a Delaware corporation. The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may deter, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would allow holders of less than a majority of our outstanding common stock to elect some directors;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\ncontain certain protective provisions in favor of the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit common stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions of the holders of common stock to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 93339, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ALIM"}
