{"cik": "1331875", "company": "Fidelity National Financial, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisk Factors Related to COVID-19, Climate Change and Other Catastrophic Events\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the occurrence of a catastrophe, including natural or man-made disasters.\nAny catastrophic event, such as pandemic diseases, terrorist attacks, floods, severe storms or hurricanes or computer cyber-terrorism, could have a material and adverse effect on our business in several respects:\n\u2022the outbreak of a pandemic disease, like the novel coronavirus COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and the operating results of our insurance business due to its impact on the economy and financial markets;\n\u2022the occurrence of any pandemic disease, natural disaster, terrorist attack or any other catastrophic event that results in our workforce being unable to be physically located at one of our facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service; or\n\u2022we could experience long-term interruptions in our service and the services provided by our significant vendors due to the effects of catastrophic events, including but not limited to government mandates to self-quarantine, work remotely and prolonged travel restrictions. Some of our operational systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery and business continuity planning cannot account for all eventualities. Additionally, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could further impede our ability to conduct business, particularly if those problems affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data;\n\u2022we manage our financial exposure for losses in our title insurance business and in our F&G business with third-party reinsurance. Catastrophic events could adversely affect the cost and availability of that reinsurance;\n\u2022the value of our investment portfolio may decrease if the securities in which we invest are negatively impacted by climate change, pandemic diseases, severe weather conditions and other catastrophic events.\nFor example, in the second and third quarters of 2020 we experienced decreases in commercial volumes and commercial fee-per-file as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19. We also experienced a decrease in the number of opened residential purchase orders and increased volatility in our investment portfolio early in the pandemic.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Acquisition of F&G\nAlthough we expect our acquisition of F&G will result in cost savings and other benefits to us, we may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nThe success of our acquisition of F&G will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the two companies following the completion of the merger. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of F&G or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger, including additional cost savings could impair our operations. In addition, we anticipate that the overall integration of F&G will be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022 the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations;\n\u2022 the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022 the retention of and possible decrease in business from the existing clients of both companies;\n\u2022 the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022 the reduction of the costs associated with each company's operations;\n\u2022 the optimization of information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022 the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;\n\u2022 the retention of key employees;\n\u2022 the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; and\n\u2022 potential unknown liabilities, expenses or delays associated with the mergers.\nThe anticipated cost savings and other benefits assume a successful integration and are based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, and other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings and other benefits may not be achieved.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the acquisition of F&G.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022 the unsuccessful integration of F&G (including for the reasons set forth in the preceding risk factor);\n\u2022 the failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger, including financial results, synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nAdditionally, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the FNF common stock, regardless of the actual operating performance of FNF and F&G.\nThe acquisition of F&G may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently anticipate that the acquisition of F&G will be accretive to earnings per share (on an adjusted net earnings basis) during the first full calendar year after the merger. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion of F&G earnings. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change. We could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nOur future results will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the acquisition of F&G.\nThe size of the business of the combined company has increased significantly. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations, including new international operations, and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nWe have substantial indebtedness following the acquisition of F&G and our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our subsidiaries may be different from what we currently expect.\nWe incurred indebtedness in order to provide funds to pay a portion of the cash portion of the merger consideration and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger. As a result, following completion of the merger, we have substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our subsidiaries may be different from what we currently expect.\nThis substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, including:\n\u2022 making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations;\n\u2022 requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service obligations and other general operating requirements;\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business and, consequently, negatively affecting our competitive position;\n\u2022 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of favorable business opportunities;\n\u2022 negatively impacting our existing credit ratings, including resulting in a downgrade or negative outlook;\n\u2022 placing us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022 limiting flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate, which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022 limiting our ability to refinance its indebtedness or increasing the cost of such indebtedness.\nIn addition, covenants in the debt instruments governing this indebtedness may limit how we conduct our business following the merger. If we incur additional indebtedness in the future, the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify.\nLawsuits relating to the F&G acquisition could be filed against us and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nLitigation is common in connection with acquisitions of public companies, regardless of any merits related to the claims. The outcome of the lawsuits that could be filed against us related to the F&G acquisition are uncertain, and we may not be successful in defending against these claims. While we will defend against these lawsuits, the costs of the defense and other effects of litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Geographic Concentrations of our Businesses\nBecause we are dependent upon California and Texas for approximately 15.2% and 12.3% and of our title insurance premiums, respectively, our business may be adversely affected by regulatory conditions in California and/or Texas.\nCalifornia and Texas are the two largest sources of revenue for our Title segment. In 2020, California-based premiums accounted for approximately 31.2% of premiums earned by our direct operations and 0.7% of our agency premium revenues, while Texas-based premiums accounted for 15.7% of premiums earned by our direct operations and 9.2% of our agency premium revenues. In the aggregate, California and Texas accounted for approximately 15.2% and 12.3%, respectively, of our total title insurance premiums for 2020. A significant part of our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to our operations in California and Texas and to the prevailing regulatory conditions in these states. Adverse regulatory developments in California and Texas, which could include reductions in the maximum rates permitted to be charged, inadequate rate increases or more fundamental changes in the design or implementation of the California and Texas title insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nConcentration in certain states for the distribution of our life insurance and annuity products may subject us to losses attributable to economic downturns or catastrophes in those states.\nOur top five states for the distribution of our life insurance and annuity products are California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Arizona. Any adverse economic developments or catastrophes in these states could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisk Factors Relating to Government Regulation of the Insurance Industry\nOur subsidiaries must comply with extensive regulations. These regulations may increase our costs or impede or impose burdensome conditions on actions that we might seek to take to increase the revenues of those subsidiaries.\nOur insurance businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate. These agencies have broad administrative and supervisory power relating to the following, among other matters:\n\u2022licensing requirements;\n\u2022trade and marketing practices;\n\u2022accounting and financing practices;\n\u2022disclosure requirements on key terms of mortgage loans;\n\u2022capital and surplus requirements;\n\u2022the amount of dividends and other payments made by insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022investment practices;\n\u2022rate schedules;\n\u2022deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u2022establishing reserves; and\n\u2022regulation of reinsurance.\nMost states also regulate insurance holding companies like us with respect to acquisitions, changes of control and the terms of transactions with our affiliates. State regulations may impede or impose burdensome conditions on our ability to increase or maintain rate levels or on other actions that we may want to take to enhance our operating results. In addition, we may incur significant costs in the course of complying with regulatory requirements. Further, various state legislatures have in the past considered offering a public alternative to the title industry in their states, as a means to increase state government revenues. Although we think this situation is unlikely, if one or more such takeovers were to occur they could adversely affect our business. We cannot be assured that future legislative or regulatory changes will not adversely affect our business operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d for further discussion of the current regulatory environment.\nOur ServiceLink subsidiary provides mortgage transaction services including title-related services and facilitation of production and management of mortgage loans. Certain of these businesses are subject to federal and state regulatory oversight. For example, ServiceLink\u2019s LoanCare business services and subservices mortgage loans secured primarily by residential real estate throughout the United States. LoanCare is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulatory oversight, including federal and state regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, and investigations by governmental and regulatory agencies, including the CFPB. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by those agencies, LoanCare receives numerous requests, subpoenas, and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of its or its clients\u2019 regulated activities.\nLoanCare is also required to maintain a variety of licenses, both federal and state. License requirements are in a frequent state of renewal and reexamination as regulations change or are reinterpreted. In addition, federal and state statutes establish specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow when collecting consumer accounts. LoanCare\u2019s failure to\ncomply with any of these laws, should the states take an opposing interpretation, could have an adverse effect on LoanCare in the event and to the extent that they apply to some or all of its servicing activities.\nState regulation of the rates we charge for title insurance could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive rate regulation by the applicable state agencies in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Title insurance rates are regulated differently in various states, with some states requiring the subsidiaries to file and receive approval of rates before such rates become effective and some states promulgating the rates that can be charged. In general, premium rates are determined on the basis of historical data for claim frequency and severity as well as related production costs and other expenses. In all states in which our title subsidiaries operate, our rates must not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. Premium rates are likely to prove insufficient when ultimate claims and expenses exceed historically projected levels. Premium rate inadequacy may not become evident quickly and may take time to correct, and could adversely affect our business operating results and financial conditions.\nOur F&G business is highly regulated and subject to numerous legal restrictions and regulations.\nState insurance regulators, the NAIC and federal regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and may impose changes in the future. New interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies, increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously and adversely affect our profitability and financial strength. We are also subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator\u2019s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may not result in compliance with another regulator\u2019s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. Regulators and other authorities have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which could result in, among other things, suspension or revocation of our licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict what form any future changes in these or other areas of regulation affecting the insurance industry might take or what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us if enacted into law. In addition, because our activities are relatively concentrated in a small number of lines of business, any change in law or regulation affecting one of those lines of business could have a disproportionate impact on us as compared to other more diversified insurance companies. See section titled \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1. Business for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our business.\nState Regulation\nOur business is subject to government regulation in each of the states in which we conduct business and is concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and other customers rather than shareholders. Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and discretionary authority, which may include, among other things, premium rates and increases thereto, underwriting practices, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers and capital adequacy. At any given time, we and our insurance subsidiaries may be the subject of a number of ongoing financial or market conduct, audits or inquiries. From time to time, regulators raise issues during such examinations or audits that could have a material impact on our business.\nWe have received inquiries from a number of state regulatory authorities regarding our use of the U.S. Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File (\u201cDeath Master File\u201d) and compliance with state claims practices regulations and unclaimed property or escheatment laws. We have established procedures to periodically compare our in-force life insurance and annuity policies against the Death Master File or similar databases; investigate any identified potential matches to confirm the death of the insured; determine whether benefits are due; and attempt to locate the beneficiaries of any benefits due or, if no beneficiary can be located, escheat the benefit to the state as unclaimed property. We believe we have established sufficient reserves with respect to these matters; however, it is possible that third parties could dispute these amounts and additional payments or additional unreported claims or liabilities could be identified which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. We cannot predict the amount or timing of any such future assessments and therefore the liability we have established for these potential assessments may not be adequate. In addition, regulators may change their interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations such as the case with broadening the scope of carriers that must contribute towards Long Term Care insolvencies.\nNAIC\nAlthough our business is subject to regulation in each state in which we conduct business, in many instances the state regulatory models emanate from the NAIC. Some of the NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, take effect automatically in the various states without affirmative action by the states. Statutes, regulations and interpretations may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting and reserve requirements. The NAIC continues\nto work to reform state regulation in various areas, including comprehensive reforms relating to cyber security regulations, best interest standards, RBC and life insurance reserves.\nOn June 10, 2016, the NAIC formally approved principle-based reserving for life insurance products with secondary guarantees, with an effective date of January 1, 2017. Effective October 2019, we began replacing our life insurance product portfolio to comply with the new 2017 CSO mortality requirement as well as the principle-based reserve (PBR) requirement. As of January 1, 2020 all life insurance policies sold by F&G are PBR compliant.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for life insurance companies that establish capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset, interest rate and certain other risks. Changes to statutory reserve or risk-based capital requirements may increase the amount of reserves or capital our insurance companies are required to hold and may impact our ability to pay dividends. In addition, changes in statutory reserve or risk-based capital requirements may adversely impact our financial strength ratings. Changes currently under consideration include adding an operational risk component, factors for asset credit risk, and group wide capital calculations.\n\u201cFiduciary\u201d Rule Proposals\nAlthough the DOL fiduciary rule has been vacated in total, similar rules proposed by state officials or the SEC may have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to IRA owners particularly in the independent agent distribution channel. Compliance with such rules may require additional supervision of agents, cause changes to compensation practices and product offerings, and increase litigation risk, all of which could have adverse impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Management will continue to monitor for potential action by state officials or the SEC to implement rules similar to the vacated DOL rule.\nBermuda and Cayman Islands Regulation\nOur business is subject to regulation in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, including the BMA and the CIMA. These regulations may limit or curtail our activities, including activities that might be profitable, and changes to existing regulations may affect our ability to continue to offer our existing products and services, or new products and services we may wish to offer in the future.\nIn particular, our reinsurance subsidiaries, F&G Life Re and F&G Re, are registered in Bermuda under the Bermuda Insurance Act and subject to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The BMA has sought regulatory equivalency, which enables Bermuda\u2019s commercial insurers to transact business with the EU on a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d In connection with its initial efforts to achieve equivalency under the European Union\u2019s Directive (2009/138/EC) (\u201cSolvency II\u201d), the BMA implemented and imposed additional requirements on the companies it regulates. The European Commission (the \u201cEC\u201d) granted Bermuda\u2019s commercial insurers full equivalence in all areas of Solvency II for an indefinite period of time effective March 24, 2016, and applies from January 1, 2016.\nRegulatory investigations of the insurance industry may lead to fines, settlements, new regulation or legal uncertainty, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time we receive inquiries and requests for information from state insurance departments, attorneys general and other regulatory agencies about various matters relating to our business. Sometimes these take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. We cooperate with all such inquiries and we have responded to or are currently responding to inquiries from multiple governmental agencies. Also, regulators and courts have been dealing with issues arising from foreclosures and related processes and documentation. Various governmental entities are studying the insurance product, market, pricing, and business practices, and potential regulatory and legislative changes, which may materially affect our business and operations. From time to time, we are assessed fines for violations of regulations or other matters or enter into settlements with such authorities, which may require us to pay fines or claims or take other actions.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Credit Risk of our Counterparties\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties, including companies with whom we have reinsurance agreements or we have purchased call options.\nOur F&G insurance subsidiaries cede material amounts of insurance and transfer related assets and certain liabilities to other insurance companies through reinsurance. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The failure, insolvency, inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to pay under the terms of reinsurance agreements with us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We regularly monitor the credit rating and performance of our reinsurance parties. Wilton Re represents our largest reinsurance counterparty exposure. We also utilize funds withheld reinsurance counterparty risk. Under funds withheld arrangements, F&G retains possession and legal title to asset backing ceded liabilities.\nOur F&G insurance subsidiaries are also exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on call options. We seek to reduce the risk associated with such agreements by purchasing such options from large, well-established financial institutions, and by holding collateral. There can be no assurance we will not suffer losses in the event of counterparty non-performance.\nIf financial institutions at which we hold escrow funds fail, it could have a material adverse impact on our company.\nWe hold customers' assets in escrow at various financial institutions, pending completion of real estate transactions. These assets are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have a contingent liability relating to proper disposition of these balances for our customers, which amounted to $26.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Failure of one or more of these financial institutions may lead us to become liable for the funds owed to third parties and there is no guarantee that we would recover the funds deposited, whether through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage or otherwise.\nRisk Factors Relating to Market Conditions\nIf economic and credit market conditions deteriorate, it could have a material adverse impact on our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is exposed to economic and financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, credit markets and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. Our investment policy in our title business is designed to maximize total return through investment income and capital appreciation consistent with moderate risk of principal, while providing adequate liquidity and complying with internal and regulatory guidelines. To achieve this objective, our marketable debt investments are primarily investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. We make investments in certain equity securities and preferred stock in order to take advantage of perceived value and for strategic purposes. Economic and credit market conditions may adversely affect the ability of some issuers of investment securities to repay their obligations and affect the values of investment securities. If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFixed maturities, equity securities and derivatives represent the majority of total cash and invested assets reported at fair value on our balance sheets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Fair value estimates are made based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument at a specific point in time. Expectations that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms are based on evidence gathered through our normal credit surveillance process and on assumptions a market participant would use in determining the current fair value.\nThe value and performance of certain of our assets are dependent upon the performance of collateral underlying these investments. It is possible the collateral will not meet performance expectations leading to adverse changes in the cash flows on our holdings of these types of securities.\nEquity market volatility could negatively impact our business.\nThe estimated cost of providing GMWB associated with our annuity products incorporates various assumptions about the overall performance of equity markets over certain time periods. Periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets or increased equity volatility could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit or policyholder account balance liabilities associated with such products, resulting in a reduction in our revenues and net earnings (loss). The rate of amortization of deferred acquisition costs (\"DAC\"), deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\") and value of business acquired (\"VOBA\") relating to FIA products could also increase if equity market performance is worse than assumed and have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investments are subject to market and credit risks. These risks could be heightened during periods of extreme volatility or disruption in financial and credit markets.\nOur invested assets and derivative financial instruments are subject to risks of credit defaults and changes in market values. Periods of extreme volatility or disruption in the financial and credit markets could increase these risks. Changes in interest rates and credit spreads could cause market price and cash flow variability in the fixed income instruments in our investment portfolio. Significant volatility and lack of liquidity in the credit markets could cause issuers of the fixed-income securities we own to default on either principal or interest payments. Additionally, market price valuations may not accurately reflect the underlying expected cash flows of securities within our investment portfolio.\nThe value of our mortgage-backed securities and our commercial and residential mortgage loan investments depends in part on the financial condition of the borrowers and tenants for the properties underlying those investments, as well as general and specific economic trends affecting the overall default rate. We are also subject to the risk that cash flows resulting from the payments on pools of mortgages that serve as collateral underlying the mortgage-backed securities we own may differ from our expectations in timing or size. Any event reducing the estimated fair value of these securities, other than on a temporary basis, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf adverse changes in the levels of real estate activity occur, our revenues may decline.\nTitle insurance revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity that includes sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. The levels of real estate activity are primarily affected by the average price of real estate sales, the availability of funds to finance purchases and mortgage interest rates.\nWe have found that residential real estate activity generally decreases in the following situations:\n\u2022when mortgage interest rates are high or increasing;\n\u2022when the mortgage funding supply is limited;\n\u2022when housing inventory is limited or home prices are high or increasing; and\n\u2022when the United States economy is weak, including high unemployment levels.\nDeclines in the level of real estate activity or the average price of real estate sales are likely to adversely affect our title insurance revenues. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (\"MBA\") Mortgage Finance Forecast as of February 19, 2021 calculates an approximately $3.7 trillion mortgage origination market for 2020, which would be an increase from 2019 resulting primarily from increased refinance activity. However, the MBA predicts overall mortgage originations in 2020 and 2021 will decrease slightly when compared to 2019. Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors that are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate. See discussion under 'Business Trends and Conditions' within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for further discussion of current market trends.\nInterest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nInterest rate risk is a significant market risk as our F&G business involves issuing interest rate sensitive obligations backed primarily by investments in fixed income assets. For the past several years interest rates have remained at or near historically low levels. The prolonged period of low rates exposes us to the risk of not achieving returns sufficient to meet our earnings targets and/or our contractual obligations. Furthermore, low or declining interest rates may reduce the rate of policyholder surrenders and withdrawals on our life insurance and annuity products, thus increasing the duration of the liabilities, creating asset and liability duration mismatches and increasing the risk of having to reinvest assets at yields below the amounts required to support our obligations. Lower interest rates may also result in decreased sales of certain insurance products, negatively impacting our profitability from new business.\nDuring periods of increasing interest rates we may offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities, and we may increase crediting rates on in-force products to keep these products competitive. We may be required to accept lower spread income (the difference between the returns we earn on our investments and the amounts we credit to contractholders) thus reducing our profitability, as returns on our portfolio of invested assets may not increase as quickly as current interest rates. Rapidly rising interest rates may also expose us to the risk of financial disintermediation, which is an increase in policy surrenders, withdrawals and requests for policy loans as customers seek to achieve higher returns elsewhere requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. If we experience unexpected withdrawal activity, we could exhaust our liquid assets and be forced to liquidate other less liquid assets such as limited partnership investments. We may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner and/or be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have developed and maintain ALM programs and procedures designed to mitigate interest rate risk by matching asset cash flows to expected liability cash flows. In addition, we assess surrender charges on withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty-free amounts that occur during the surrender charge period. There can be no assurance actual withdrawals, contract benefits, and maturities will match our estimates. Despite our efforts to reduce the impact of rising interest rates, we may be required to sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to an increase in surrenders, withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold.\nWe may experience spread income compression, and a loss of anticipated earnings, if credited interest rates are increased on renewing contracts in an effort to decrease or manage withdrawal activity. Our expectation for future spread income is an important component in amortization of DAC, deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\"), and VOBA under U.S. GAAP. Significant reductions in spread income may cause us to accelerate DAC, DSI, and VOBA amortization. In addition, certain statutory capital and reserve requirements are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates and a prolonged period of low\ninterest rates may increase the statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves.\nThe Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 may impact our business and the markets in which we compete.\nThe Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019, Pub.L. 116-94 (the \u201cSECURE Act\u201d), was signed into law on December 20, 2019 as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 and went into effect in certain respects as early as January 1, 2020. The SECURE Act contains provisions that may impact our F&G insurance subsidiaries, including: elimination of the \u201cstretch IRA\u201d (funds from inherited IRAs must now be fully withdrawn by beneficiaries within 10 years of the account owner\u2019s death and, as a result, IRAs may be less desirable to our customers, and our administrative system for handling distributions from IRAs invested in our annuity products may need to be updated to reflect the shortened distribution period for IRA beneficiaries); elimination of age limit for making traditional IRA contributions; raising of the age for required minimum distributions from IRAs from 70\u00bd to 72 (particularly impacting our administrative system for handling distributions from IRAs invested in our annuity products); expansion of 401K plan eligibility for part-time workers; creation of new employer protections for offering annuities, including a fiduciary safe harbor for employer retirement plan sponsors that wish to add in-plan annuity products (particularly impacting how we and our competitors may now sell annuity products to employers or provide certifications necessary to meet the SECURE Act fiduciary safe harbor requirements); and lowering of barriers for offering multiple employer plans. The SECURE Act changes may also affect, to some extent, the length of time that IRA assets remain in our annuity products. While we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, the SECURE Act will ultimately impact us, the SECURE Act may have implications for our business operations and the markets in which we compete. See section titled \u201cF&G - Regulation\u201d in Item 1. Business.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe have recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and an economic downturn could cause these balances to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nGoodwill aggregated approximately $4,495 million, or 8.9% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2020. Current accounting rules require that goodwill be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstance indicating the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $3 million of goodwill impairment related to a real estate brokerage subsidiary in our Corporate and other segment. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no goodwill impairment charge was recorded. However, if there is an economic downturn in the future, the carrying amount of our goodwill may no longer be recoverable, and we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization and the impact of the economy to determine if there is an impairment of goodwill in future periods.\nThe pattern of amortizing our DAC, DSI, and VOBA balances relies on assumptions and estimates made by management. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAmortization of our DAC, DSI and VOBA balances depends on the actual and expected profits generated by the respective lines of business that incurred the expenses. Expected profits are dependent on assumptions regarding a number of factors including investment returns, benefit payments, expenses, mortality, and policy lapse. Due to the uncertainty associated with establishing these assumptions, we cannot, with precision, determine the exact pattern of profit emergence. As a result, amortization of these balances will vary from period to period. Any difference in actual experience versus expected results could require us to, among other things, accelerate the amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA that would reduce profitability for such lines of business in the current period.\nFor additional information, see Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, under Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nWe may face losses if our actual experience differs significantly from our reserving assumptions.\nOur profitability depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting rates for our products and establishing liabilities for future life insurance and annuity policy benefits and claims. However, due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liabilities for unpaid policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts we will ultimately pay to settle these liabilities. As a result, we may experience volatility in our profitability and our reserves from period to period. To the\nextent that actual experience is less favorable than our underlying assumptions, we could be required to increase our liabilities, which may reduce our profitability and impact our financial strength.\nWe have minimal experience to date on policyholder behavior for our GMWB products that we began issuing in 2008. If emerging experience deviates from our assumptions on GMWB utilization, it could have a significant effect on our reserve levels and related results of operations. Based on experience on GMWB utilization, which continues to emerge, we updated our GMWB utilization assumption during 2019, with a favorable impact on reserves. We will continue to monitor the GMWB utilization assumption and update our best estimate as applicable.\nSee Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, under. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nOur management has historically sought to grow through acquisitions, both in our current lines of business as well as in lines of business outside of our traditional areas of focus or geographic areas. This expansion of our business subjects us to associated risks, such as risks and uncertainties associated with new companies, the diversion of management\u2019s attention and lack of experience in operating unrelated businesses, and may affect our credit and ability to repay our debt.\nOur management has historically sought to grow through acquisitions, both in our current lines of business, as well as lines of business that are not directly tied to or synergistic with our current operations. Accordingly, we have in the past acquired, and may in the future acquire, businesses in industries or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than we are with our current businesses. These activities involve risks that could adversely affect our operating results, due to uncertainties involved with new companies, diversion of management\u2019s attention and lack of substantial experience in operating such businesses. There can be no guarantee that we will not enter into transactions or make acquisitions that will cause us to incur additional debt, increase our exposure to market and other risks and cause our credit or financial strength ratings to decline.\nWe are a holding company and depend on distributions from our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company whose primary assets are the securities of our operating subsidiaries. Our ability to pay interest on our outstanding debt and our other obligations and to pay dividends is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us. If our operating subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to meet our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur title insurance subsidiaries must comply with state laws, which require them to maintain minimum amounts of working capital, surplus and reserves, and place restrictions on the amount of dividends that they can distribute to us. Compliance with these laws will limit the amounts our regulated subsidiaries can dividend to us. During 2021, our title insurers may pay dividends or make distributions to us of approximately $551 million; however, insurance regulators have the authority to prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our title insurers to us if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders.\nThe maximum dividend permitted by law is not necessarily indicative of an insurer\u2019s actual ability to pay dividends, which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer\u2019s ratings or competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, depending on business and regulatory conditions, we may in the future need to retain cash in our underwriters or even contribute cash to one or more of them in order to maintain their ratings or their statutory capital position. Such a requirement could be the result of investment losses, reserve charges, adverse operating conditions in the current economic environment or changes in interpretation of statutory accounting requirements by regulators.\nOur business could be interrupted or compromised if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships.\nIf we do not maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or third-party providers do not perform as contracted, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If there is a delay in our third-party providers\u2019 introduction of our new products or if our third-party providers are unable to service our customers appropriately, we may experience a loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our reliance on third-party service providers that we do not control does not relieve us of our responsibilities and requirements. Any failure or negligence by such third-party service providers in carrying out their contractual duties may result in us becoming subjected to liability to parties who are harmed and ensuing litigation. Any litigation relating to such matters could be costly, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome of any such litigation may be uncertain. Moreover, any adverse publicity arising from such litigation, even if the litigation is not successful, could adversely affect our reputation and sales of our products.\nSee section titled \"Outsourcing\u201d in Item 1. Business for functions we outsource to third-party service providers.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain national marketing organizations and independent agents, sales of our products may be reduced.\nWithin our F&G operating segment, we must attract and retain our network of IMOs and independent agents to sell our products. Insurance companies compete vigorously for productive agents. We compete with other life insurance companies for marketers and agents primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. Such marketers and agents may promote products offered by other life insurance companies that offer a larger variety of products than we do. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of marketers and agents to sell our products, our ability to compete and our revenues would suffer.\nFailure of our enterprise-wide risk management processes could result in unexpected monetary losses, damage to our reputation, additional costs or impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\nAs a large insurance entity and a publicly traded company, we have always had risk management functions, policies and procedures throughout our operations and management. These functions include but are not limited to departments dedicated to enterprise risk management and information technology risk management, information security, business continuity, lender strategy and development, and vendor risk management. These policies and procedures have evolved over the years as we continually reassess our processes both internally and to comply with changes in the regulatory environment. Due to limitations inherent in any internal process, if our risk management processes prove unsuccessful at identifying and responding to risks, we could incur unexpected monetary losses, damage to our reputation, additional costs or impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\nIf we experience changes in the rate or severity of title insurance claims, it may be necessary for us to record additional charges to our claim loss reserve. This may result in lower net earnings and the potential for earnings volatility.\nBy their nature, claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. From time to time, we experience large losses or an overall worsening of our loss payment experience in regard to the frequency or severity of claims that require us to record additional charges to our claims loss reserve. There are currently pending several large claims, which we believe can be defended successfully without material loss payments. However, if unanticipated material payments are required to settle these claims, it could result in or contribute to additional charges to our claim loss reserves. These loss events are unpredictable and adversely affect our earnings.\nAt each quarter end, our recorded reserve for claim losses is initially the result of taking the prior recorded reserve for claim losses, adding the current provision to that balance and subtracting actual paid claims from that balance, resulting in an amount that management then compares to our actuary's central estimate provided in the actuarial calculation. Due to the uncertainty and judgment used by both management and our actuary, our ultimate liability may be greater or less than our current reserves and/or our actuary\u2019s calculation. If the recorded amount is within a reasonable range of the actuary\u2019s central estimate, but not at the central estimate, management assesses other factors in order to determine our best estimate. These factors, which are both qualitative and quantitative, can change from period to period and include items such as current trends in the real estate industry (which management can assess, but for which there is a time lag in the development of the data used by our actuary), any adjustments from the actuarial estimates needed for the effects of unusually large or small claims, improvements in our claims management processes, and other cost saving measures. Depending upon our assessment of these factors, we may or may not adjust the recorded reserve. If the recorded amount is not within a reasonable range of the actuary\u2019s central estimate, we would record a charge or credit and reassess the provision rate on a go forward basis.\nIf the rating agencies downgrade our insurance companies, our results of operations and competitive position in the title insurance industry may suffer.\nRatings have always been an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Our title insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P, Moody\u2019s, and Demotech. Our F&G insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P. Ratings reflect the opinion of a rating agency with regard to an insurance company\u2019s or insurance holding company\u2019s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors. Our ratings are subject to continued periodic review by rating agencies and the continued retention of those ratings cannot be assured. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by those entities, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our claim loss prevention procedures fail, we could incur significant claim losses.\nIn the ordinary course of our title insurance business, we assume risks related to insuring clear title to residential and commercial properties. We have established procedures to mitigate the risk of loss from title claims, including extensive\nunderwriting and risk assessment procedures. We also mitigate the risk of large claim losses by reinsuring risks with other insurers under excess of loss and case-by-case (\u201cfacultative\u201d) reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance agreements generally provide that the reinsurer is liable for loss and loss adjustment expense payments exceeding the amount retained by the ceding company. However, the ceding company remains primarily liable to the insured whether or not the reinsurer is able to meet its contractual obligations. If inherent limitations cause our claim loss risk mitigation procedures to fail, we could incur substantial losses having an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur use of independent agents for a significant amount of our title insurance policies could adversely impact the frequency and severity of title claims.\nIn our agency operations, an independent agent performs the search and examination function or the agent may purchase a search product from us. In either case, the agent is responsible for ensuring that the search and examination is completed. The agent thus retains the majority of the title premium collected, with the balance remitted to the title underwriter for bearing the risk of loss in the event that a claim is made under the title insurance policy. Our relationship with each agent is governed by an agency agreement defining how the agent issues a title insurance policy on our behalf. The agency agreement also sets forth the agent\u2019s liability to us for policy losses attributable to the agent\u2019s errors. For each agent with whom we enter into an agency agreement, financial and loss experience records are maintained. Periodic audits of our agents are also conducted and the number of agents with whom we transact business is strategically managed in an effort to reduce future expenses and manage risks. Despite efforts to monitor the independent agents with which we transact business, there is no guarantee that an agent will comply with their contractual obligations to us. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that, due to changes in the regulatory environment and litigation trends, we will not be held liable for errors and omissions by agents. Accordingly, our use of independent agents could adversely impact the frequency and severity of title claims.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFailure of our information security systems or processes could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, monetary losses, additional costs and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\nOur operations are highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. We use our computer systems to receive, process, store and transmit sensitive personal consumer data (such as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit cards and bank account information) and important business information of our customers. We also electronically manage substantial cash, investment assets and escrow account balances on behalf of ourselves and our customers, as well as financial information about our businesses generally. The integrity of our computer systems and the protection of the information that resides on such systems are important to our successful operation. If we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure, adapt to emerging security threats or follow our internal business processes with respect to security, the information or assets we hold could be compromised. Further, even if we, or third parties to which we outsource certain information technology services, maintain a reasonable, industry-standard information security infrastructure to mitigate these risks, the inherent risk that unauthorized access to information or assets remains. This risk is increased by transmittal of information over the internet and the increased threat and sophistication of cyber criminals. While, to date, we believe that we have not experienced a material breach of our computer systems, the occurrence or scope of such events is not always apparent. If additional information regarding an event previously considered immaterial is discovered, or a new event were to occur, it could potentially have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. In addition, some laws and certain of our contracts require notification of various parties, including regulators, consumers or customers, in the event that confidential or personal information has or may have been taken or accessed by unauthorized parties. Such notifications can potentially result, among other things, in adverse publicity, diversion of management and other resources, the attention of regulatory authorities, the imposition of fines, and disruptions in business operations, the effects of which may be material. Any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches, or the perception that such breaches may occur, could inhibit our ability to retain or attract new clients and/or result in financial losses, litigation, increased costs, negative publicity, or other adverse consequences to our business.\nFurther, our financial institution clients have obligations to safeguard their information technology systems and the confidentiality of customer information. In certain of our businesses, we are bound contractually and/or by regulation to comply with the same requirements. If we fail to comply with these regulations and requirements, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract, governmental proceedings or the imposition of fines. In addition, future adoption of more restrictive privacy laws, rules or industry security requirements by federal or state regulatory bodies or by a specific industry in which we do business could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes.\nFailure to respond to rapid changes in technology could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nRapidly evolving technologies and innovations in software and financial technology could drive changes in how real estate transactions are recorded and processed throughout the mortgage life cycle. There is no guarantee that we will be able to\neffectively adapt to and utilize changing technology. Existing or new competitors may be able to utilize or create technology more effectively than us, which could result in the loss of market share.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could limit our ability to gain or maintain our position in the industry and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur F&G insurance subsidiaries operate in a highly competitive industry and encounter significant competition in all of our product lines from other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources and higher financial strength ratings than us and that may have a greater market share, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have different profitability expectations than us. Competition could result in, among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products.\nOur annuity products compete with fixed indexed, fixed rate and variable annuities sold by other insurance companies and also with mutual fund products, traditional bank investments and other retirement funding alternatives offered by asset managers, banks and broker-dealers. The ability of banks and broker dealers to increase their securities-related business or to affiliate with insurance companies may materially and adversely affect sales of all of our products by substantially increasing the number and financial strength of potential competitors. Our insurance products compete with those of other insurance companies, financial intermediaries and other institutions based on a number of factors, including premium rates, policy terms and conditions, service provided to distribution channels and policyholders, ratings by rating agencies, reputation and commission structures.\nOur ability to compete is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to develop competitive and profitable products, our ability to maintain low unit costs, and our maintenance of adequate financial strength ratings from rating agencies. Our ability to compete is also dependent upon, among other things, our ability to attract and retain distribution channels to market our products, the competition for which is vigorous.\nThe loss of key personnel could negatively affect our financial results and impair our operating abilities.\nOur success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team and officers. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our operating results and in turn the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we have employment agreements with many of our officers, there can be no assurance that the entire term of the employment agreement will be served or that the employment agreement will be renewed upon expiration.\nWe are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings, including in some cases class-action lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, investigations or other proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters or regulatory proceedings, we may be forced to pay damages, fines or penalties and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
