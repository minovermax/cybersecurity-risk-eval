{"cik": "1145255", "company": "HENNESSY ADVISORS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe face many risk factors, several of which are inherent in the financial services industry and the investment advisory business. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our common stock. If any of the risks described below were to actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nVolatility in and disruption of the capital markets and changes in the economy may significantly affect our revenues.\nThe securities markets are inherently volatile and may be affected by factors beyond our control, including global economic conditions, industry trends, interest and inflation rate fluctuations, and other factors that are difficult to predict. Because our assets under management are largely concentrated in equity products, our results are particularly susceptible to downturns in the equity markets or a decline in the amount of assets invested in the equity markets. We derive all of our operating revenues from investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees paid to us by Hennessy Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our revenues increase or decrease as our average assets under management increase or decrease, which is affected by market appreciation or depreciation and purchases and redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. This risk is further discussed and quantified in Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d below.\nInvestors in the Hennessy Funds can redeem their investments at any time and for any reason, including poor investment performance. A decline in our assets under management adversely affects our revenues.\nInvestors in the Hennessy Funds may redeem their investments at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Success in the investment advisory and mutual fund business is largely dependent on investment performance, as well as distribution and client servicing. If the Hennessy Funds perform poorly compared to the mutual funds of other investment advisory firms, we may experience a decrease in purchases of shares and an increase in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues.\nAdverse opinions of the Hennessy Funds by third parties, including rating agencies or industry analysts, could decrease new investments in or accelerate redemptions from the Hennessy Funds, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nInvestment strategies are rated, ranked or assessed by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, distribution partners and industry periodicals. These assessments often influence the investment decisions of investors. If the Hennessy Funds received an adverse rating, ranking or assessment from a third party, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets from the Hennessy Funds by existing investors and the inability to attract additional investments into the Hennessy Funds from existing and new investors, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues.\nInvestor behavior is influenced by short-term investment performance of mutual funds.\nInvestor behavior may be based on many factors, including short-term investment performance. Poor short-term performance of the Hennessy Funds, irrespective of longer-term success, could potentially lead to a decrease in purchases of shares and an increase in redemptions, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of the Hennessy Funds.\nAs of September 30, 2015, our total assets under management were concentrated in the following three Hennessy Funds: the Hennessy Focus Fund (32% of total assets under management), the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (26% of total assets under management), and the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (16% of total assets under management). Consequently, our revenue follows a similar pattern of concentration: the Hennessy Focus Fund (36% of total revenue), the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (21% of total revenue), and the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (10% of total revenue). As a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to the performance of these funds and our ability to maintain and grow assets under management in these funds. If any of these funds were to experience a significant volume of redemptions for any reason, our assets under management would be reduced, adversely affecting our revenues.\nWe face intense competition in attracting investors and retaining net assets in the Hennessy Funds.\nThe investment advisory industry is intensely competitive and new participants are continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment advisors, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors we seek to serve. If we are not able to attract investors and retain net assets in the Hennessy Funds notwithstanding this environment, our revenues could decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor more information regarding competitive factors, see the \u201cCompetition\u201d subheading in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d above.\nOur investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements can be terminated on short notice, are not freely assignable and must be renewed annually; the loss of such agreements would reduce our revenues.\nWe generate all of our operating revenues from the investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements covering the Hennessy Funds. These agreements may be terminated without penalty on 60 days\u2019 notice and may not be assigned without investor consent. In addition, they must be renewed annually by (i) the Funds\u2019 Board of Trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (ii) a majority of the disinterested trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust. The termination or non-renewal of these agreements, or the renegotiation of the terms of these agreements in a manner detrimental to us, could result in a substantial reduction of our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors to manage the portfolio composition of certain of the Hennessy Funds and any matters that have an adverse impact to their businesses, or any change in our relationships with our sub-advisors, could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nWe utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors to manage the portfolio composition of six of the Hennessy Funds. Although we perform due diligence on our sub-advisors, we do not manage their day-to-day business activities. Our financial condition and profitability may be adversely affected by situations that are specific to such sub-advisors, such as a disruption of their operations, exposure to disciplinary action or reputational harm.\nWe periodically negotiate the terms and conditions of these sub-advisory relationships, and there can be no assurance that such\nterms will remain acceptable to us or our sub-advisors. These relationships may also be terminated by us or the applicable sub-advisor upon short notice without penalty. An interruption or termination of our sub-advisory relationships could affect our ability to market our sub-advised funds and result in a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nAssets invested through third party intermediaries have a higher risk of redemption and are subject to changes in fee structures, which could reduce our revenues.\nInvestments in the Hennessy Funds made through third party intermediaries, as opposed to direct investments in the Hennessy Funds, can be more easily moved to investments in funds outside of the Hennessy Fund family. Third party intermediaries are attractive to investors because of the ease of accessibility to a variety of funds, but this causes the investments to be more sensitive to fluctuations in performance, especially in the short-term. If we are not able to retain the assets of the Hennessy Funds held through third party intermediaries, our assets under managements would be reduced. As a result, our revenues could decline and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on third party investment professionals and the distribution channels they utilize to market the Hennessy Funds.\nOur primary source of distribution of the Hennessy Funds is through intermediaries that include national, regional and independent broker-dealers, financial planners and registered investment advisors. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution channels. We cannot guarantee we will be able to retain access to these channels at similar pricing or at all. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. These distribution intermediaries can generally terminate their relationship with us on short notice. Our inability to retain access to these distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our business because investment professionals may not distribute the Hennessy Funds if we are no longer participants on the platforms of firms that permit their investment professionals to utilize no-load funds for their investors. Either of these events could cause the net assets of the Hennessy Funds to decline, which would decrease our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, these intermediaries generally offer their customers a broad array of investment products that are in addition to, and which compete with, the Hennessy Funds. The intermediaries or their customers may favor competing investment products over the Hennessy Funds. To the extent that current or future intermediaries or their customers prefer to do business with our competitors, our market share, revenues and net income could decline.\nIndustry trends and market pressure to lower our investment advisory fees could reduce our profit margin.\nOur profits are highly dependent on the fees we are able to charge to the Hennessy Funds for investment advisory services. To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of the investment advisory fees we charge to the Hennessy Funds, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of the Hennessy Funds and not on the level of our investment advisory fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward lower fees in some segments of the investment advisory industry. In order for us to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide our mutual fund investors with investment returns and service that will adequately compensate them for investing in our mutual funds with their current fee structures. We cannot be assured that we will succeed in maintaining our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be required to forego all or a portion of our fees under our management contracts covering the Hennessy Funds.\nThe Funds\u2019 Board of Trustees must conduct analysis regarding the reasonableness of our investment advisory fees. We regularly analyze the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds and have the right to waive fees at our discretion to compete with other mutual funds with lower expense ratios (although in the past we have only waived fees based on contractual limitations, all of which have since expired or been terminated). Any decision to waive fees voluntarily would not apply to previous periods, but would only apply on a going forward basis.\nWe utilize quantitative investment strategies for some of the Hennessy Funds that require us to invest in specific portfolios of securities and hold these positions for a specified period of time regardless of performance.\nOur formula driven funds adhere to specific investment strategies during the annual rebalancing period and throughout the course of the year. Adhering to our investment strategies may result in the elimination of better performing stocks from our funds\u2019 portfolios and an increase in stocks that have historically underperformed. Additionally, we will maintain a position in a relatively poorly performing security throughout the course of the portfolio holding period. Either of these actions could, in theory, result in relatively low performance of the formula-driven Hennessy Funds and adversely affect the net assets of such Hennessy Funds. A decrease in the net assets of the Hennessy Funds would adversely affect our revenue.\nThe Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund invest in the Japanese stock market in Yen, which involves foreign exchange and economic uncertainties.\nThe Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund are invested in securities listed on the Japanese stock market, which may expose us to risks that are not typically associated with an investment in a U.S. issuer. The values of these funds fluctuate with changes in the value of the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. dollar. Investments in Japanese securities may also expose us to the economic uncertainties affecting Japan. Financial accounting standards and practices may differ, and there may be less information on Japanese companies available publicly. If these circumstances result in a reduction of the total assets of the Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, our assets under management would be reduced and therefore our revenues would be reduced as well.\nThe terms of our loan agreement may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes or to take future actions. In addition, certain events could cause us to default on our loan agreement.\nThe amount outstanding under our loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association and California Bank & Trust as of September 30, 2015 was $35.0 million (consisting of a $20.0 million promissory note to U.S. Bank National Association and a $15.0 million promissory note to California Bank & Trust). The loan agreement contains a number of covenants that collectively impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The loan agreement also contains a number of events that would constitute an event of default, such as a failure by us to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement or the termination or non-renewal of one or more of our management contracts if such termination or non-renewal would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us. The occurrence of an event of default would give the lenders the right to declare our borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral we granted to them, which consists of substantially all of our assets. If the debt under our loan agreement were accelerated, we might not have sufficient cash on be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity.\nUnder our current loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association and California Bank & Trust, our interest rate is effectively 4% as of September 30, 2015. Because the interest payable is a floating rate (see further discussion in Footnote 7 to the Financial Statements under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), the interest expense we incur will vary with changes in the applicable reference rate. As a result, an increase in short-term interest rates will increase our interest costs.\nWe depend upon key personnel to manage our business and the loss of any of their services could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, the cost to retain our key personnel could put pressure on our operating margins.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and performance of key personnel, including (i) Neil J. Hennessy, our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, (ii) Teresa M. Nilsen, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and (iii) Daniel B. Steadman, our Executive Vice President in charge of expansion and Chief Compliance Officer. The business acumen, investment advisory expertise and business relationships of these individuals are critical elements in operating and expanding our business. The loss of services of any of Messrs. Hennessy or Steadman or Ms. Nilsen or other key personnel for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, in order to retain certain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense.\nManagement contracts purchased by us are currently classified as an indefinite life asset subject to impairment analysis. The impairment analysis is based on subjective criteria, and an impairment loss could be recorded.\nThe investment management contracts that we have purchased, a $62.5 million asset on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2015, are considered an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Management reviews the classification of the asset as an asset with an \u201cindefinite life\u201d each reporting period. If our purchased investment management contracts are ever classified in the future as an asset with a definite life, we would begin amortizing such agreements over their remaining useful life. If the contracts continue to be determined an indefinite life asset, we would continue to review the carrying value to determine if any impairment has occurred. The analysis has been based on anticipated future cash flows, which are calculated based on assets under management. Although the contracts are not currently impaired, there is always a possibility of impairment in the future, which could require us to write-off all or a portion of the contracts. A write-off, depending on the amount, could have operational risks and could have a significant impact on the value of our equity and our earnings per share.\nWe pursue strategic asset purchases as part of our regular business strategy, which involve inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and potentially dilute the holdings of current shareholders.\nAs part of our regular business strategy, we pursue strategic purchases of assets related to management of additional mutual funds. This strategy is accompanied by risks including, among others, the possibility of the following:\n\u2022\nthe potential unavailability of attractive acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\na high level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources than we do;\n\u2022\nour inability to value potential asset purchases accurately and negotiate acceptable purchase terms;\n\u2022\nour inability to secure enough affirmative votes to gain approval from the target fund\u2019s shareholders of the proposed fund reorganization related to the acquisition of the management assets;\n\u2022\nthe loss of mutual fund assets paid for in an asset purchase through redemptions by shareholders of the mutual funds involved in the asset purchase;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated asset purchase expenses;\n\u2022\nour inability to successfully integrate and maintain adequate infrastructure to support business growth;\n\u2022\nincreasing our leverage;\n\u2022\nthe potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\ndilution to our shareholders if we fund an asset purchase in whole or in part with our common stock; and\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our earnings if purchased intangible assets become impaired.\nIf one or more of these risks occur, we may be unable to successfully complete a purchase of management-related assets (thereby requiring us to write-off any related expenses), we may experience an impairment of management contract valuations and we may not achieve the expected return on investment. Any of these results could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe potential future growth of our business may place significant demands on our resources and employees, and may increase our expenses, risks and regulatory oversight.\nThe potential future growth of our business may place significant demands on our infrastructure and our investment team and other employees, which may increase our expenses. The potential inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could constrain our ability to expand our businesses. We may face significant challenges in maintaining and developing adequate financial and operational controls, implementing new or updated information and financial systems, managing and appropriately sizing our work force, and updating other components of our business on a timely and cost-effective basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage the growth of our business effectively, or that we will be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.\nHigher insurance premiums and increased insurance coverage risks could increase our costs and reduce our profitability.\nWhile we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate, we cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or, if covered, that such liabilities and losses will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, or that our insurers will remain solvent and meet their obligations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our insurance policies will continue to be available at current terms and fees.\nWe are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. Various claims may also arise against us in the ordinary course of business, such as employment-related claims. There has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on various software applications and other technologies, as well as on third parties who utilize various software applications and other technologies, for our business to function properly and to safeguard confidential information; any significant limitation, failure or security breach could constrain our operations.\nWe use software and related technologies throughout our business and also utilize third party vendors who use software and related technologies to provide services to us and the Hennessy Funds. Although we take protective measures (including striving to understand the protective measures of our third party vendors) and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, third party failures or other unexpected events. We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the failure to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. We could also be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information. As part of our normal business operations, we and certain of our third party vendors store and transmit confidential and proprietary information. Although we take protective measures, the security of our and our vendor\u2019s computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to hacking, breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact, such as an authorized employee or vendor inadvertently or intentionally causing us to release confidential or proprietary information. Finally, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and other mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions.\nIf any of these events occur, we could suffer a financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to the Hennessy Funds and their investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.\nWe are exposed to legal risk and litigation, which could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against the financial services industry have been increasing. While we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards, we are always open to the risk of litigation. We could be sued by many different parties, including, by way of example, investors in the Hennessy Funds, our own shareholders, our employees or regulators. Lawsuits or investigations that we may become involved in could be very expensive and highly damaging to our reputation, even if the underlying claims are without merit.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions that have been enacted and entitles persons who report alleged wrongdoing to the SEC to cash rewards. We anticipate that these provisions will result in a significant increase in whistleblower claims across our industry. Addressing such claims could generate significant expenses and take up significant management time, even for frivolous or non-meritorious claims.\nAny damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a reduction in revenues and profitability.\nOur success depends, in part, on maintaining a strong reputation in the investment community. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate even if they are without merit or satisfactorily addressed. Our reputation may be impacted by many factors, including but not limited to, litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations, conflicts of interest, employee misconduct or rumors. Any damage to our reputation could result in redemptions by investors in the Hennessy Funds, impede our ability to attract new investors or negatively impact our relationships with third party intermediaries, all of which could result in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is extensively regulated, which increases our costs of doing business, and our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm our financial condition.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, particularly by the SEC. We are subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and various other statutes. The regulations we are subject to are designed primarily to protect investors in the Hennessy Funds as opposed to our shareholders. In addition to an increased number of applicable laws and regulations, the mutual fund industry has undergone increased scrutiny by the SEC and state regulators for the past several years, resulting in numerous enforcement actions, \u201csweep\u201d examinations, and new rules and rule proposals. These actions have increased our costs in managing the Hennessy Funds, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new rules and other regulatory actions or legislation require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel or buy new technology to comply with these rules and laws. The changes in laws or regulations could also have a material adverse effect on us by limiting the sources of our revenues and increasing our costs. Our business may be materially affected not only by securities regulations, but also by regulations of general application. For example, the amount of net assets in the Hennessy Funds in a given time period could be affected by, among other things, existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board. As another example, federal legislation relating to cybersecurity could impose additional requirements on our operations.\nAlthough we strive to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws or regulations, if we were found to have violated an applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration as an investment advisor. If a sanction were imposed against us or our personnel, even if only for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to such a sanction could harm our reputation, result in redemptions by investors in the Hennessy Funds and impede our ability to attract new investors, all of which could result in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management contracts contain established investment guidelines and other contractual requirements; any failure to comply with such guidelines and requirements could result in claims, losses or regulatory sanctions.\nOur management contracts with the Hennessy Funds contain established investment guidelines and other contractual requirements that we are required to comply with when we provide our investment advisory services. We are also required to comply with numerous investment, asset valuation, distribution and tax requirements under applicable law and regulations. Any allegation of a failure to adhere to these guidelines or requirements could result in investor claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. We have installed procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants and lawyers to assist in satisfying these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these precautions will protect us from potential liabilities.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors in the Hennessy Funds and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to attracting and retaining investors in the Hennessy Funds. In recent years, there have been a number of highly-publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry. Although we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and emphasize the importance of doing so to our employees, there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example,\nif an employee were to engage or be accused of engaging in illegal or suspicious activity (such as improper trading, disclosure of confidential information or breach of fiduciary duties), we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and ability to maintain and grow the number of investors in the Hennessy Funds.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules and therefore we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective at all times in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting were ineffective, we could be subjected to adverse regulatory consequences, including, among others, administrative cease and desist orders, injunctive orders or civil monetary penalties, or a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Any of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business or result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe intend to pay regular dividends to our shareholders, but our ability to do so is subject to the discretion of our board of directors.\nWe have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005. The declaration, amount, and payment of dividends, if any, to our shareholders by us are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors will take into account such matters as general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant.\nThe historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results of the Hennessy Funds or of any returns expected on our common stock.\nThe historical and potential future returns of the Hennessy Funds are not directly linked to returns on our common stock, such that positive performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessarily result in positive returns on our common stock. Nonetheless, poor performance of the Hennessy Funds will result in a reduction of our revenues and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results that should be expected from such funds.\nWe used of a portion of our cash reserves to repurchase shares of our common stock, which presents potential risks and disadvantages to us and our continuing shareholders.\nIn September 2015, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $25.0 million pursuant to a self-tender offer. At September 30, 2015, we had outstanding authorization from our Board of Directors to purchase up to an additional 908,807 shares of our common stock from time to time under our repurchase program. Although our Board has determined that these repurchases are in the best interests of our shareholders, they expose us to certain risks including:\n\u2022\nthe risks resulting from a reduction in the size of our \u201cpublic float,\u201d which is the number of shares of our common stock that are owned by non-affiliated shareholders and available for trading in the securities markets, which may reduce the volume of trading in our shares and result in reduced liquidity and, potentially, lower trading prices;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our stock price could decline and that we would be able to repurchase shares of our common stock in the future at a lower price per share than the price we paid in our self-tender offer; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that the use of a portion of our cash reserves for this purpose has reduced the amount of cash that would otherwise be available to pursue potential cash acquisitions or other strategic business opportunities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, refinance existing debt, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to meet the future cash needs of the Company is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although the Company has been successful in generating sufficient cash in the past, it may not be successful in the future. We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives or refinance existing debt, and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to access capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted.\nEquity markets and our common stock have historically been volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience volatility, and the broader equity markets have experienced and may again experience significant price and volume fluctuations. In addition, our announcements of quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock has relatively limited trading volume, and ownership of a large percentage is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and significantly affect our share price.\nWe have a limited number of shareholders, and a large percentage of our common stock is held by an even smaller number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders were to decide to liquidate their ownership positions, it could cause significant fluctuations in the share price of our common stock. Public companies with a limited number of shareholders, such as we have, often have difficulty generating trading volume in their stock.", "PERMNO": 14599, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "HNNA"}
