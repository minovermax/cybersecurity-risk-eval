{"cik": "1071255", "company": "LAKES ENTERTAINMENT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of us.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nEconomic conditions may cause declines in casino gaming activity and other consumer spending which could adversely affect the financial performance of the casino we own and result in lower revenue and income to us.\nOur operating results and performance depend significantly on economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending in the casino we own. A decline in consumer spending may cause the revenue generated from the casino we own to be adversely impacted.\nExtreme competition exists in the gaming industry.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive and continues to proliferate throughout the country as more jurisdictions are choosing to allow gaming or its expansion, including online gaming. The casino owned by us competes with all forms of gaming, and will compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in additional jurisdictions, as well as with other types of entertainment. We also compete with other gaming companies for opportunities to acquire legal gaming sites in emerging gaming jurisdictions and for the opportunity to manage casinos on Indian land. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which limits our ability to pursue certain opportunities. Further expansion of gaming could also significantly adversely affect our business.\nBecause our primary source of revenue is generated from the operation of Rocky Gap, our failure to develop new profitable business opportunities, either through the Merger with Golden Gaming or otherwise, will impact our future growth, cash flow and profitability.\nA significant source of our historical revenues was generated from our management and development of Indian casinos. We have no current existing agreements to manage Indian casinos. Currently, our only source of operating revenue is from the operation of Rocky Gap. If Rocky Gap isn\u2019t profitable, or if we fail to develop new profitable business opportunities, either through the Merger with Golden Gaming or otherwise, our future growth, cash flow and profitability will be adversely impacted.\nOur entry into new businesses may result in future losses.\nWe may diversify into other businesses, including the businesses of Golden Gaming if the Merger is completed. Such businesses could involve business risks separate from the risks we have historically faced and these investments may result in future losses to us. These risks include but are not limited to negative cash flow; initial high development costs of new products and/or services without corresponding sales pending receipt of corporate and regulatory approvals; market introduction and acceptance of new products and/or services; and obtaining regulatory approvals required to conduct the new businesses. Diversification activities may never successfully add to our future revenues and income and the costs of evaluating potential business opportunities may adversely impact our profitability during the periods they are incurred.\nThe commencement or completion of future potential casino development projects, if any are attempted, may be significantly delayed or prevented due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe opening of any future facility will be contingent upon, among other things, receipt of all regulatory licenses, permits, allocations and authorizations, the completion of construction and the hiring and training of sufficient personnel. The scope of the approvals required to construct and open a facility will be extensive, and the failure to obtain such approvals could prevent or delay the completion of construction or opening of all or part of a facility or otherwise affect the design and features of a proposed casino.\nEven once a schedule for such construction and development activities is established, such development activities may not begin or be completed on time, or at any other time. The budget for a project may also be exceeded.\nIn addition, the regulatory approvals necessary for the construction and operation of casinos are often challenged in litigation brought by government entities, citizens groups and other organizations and individuals. Such litigation can significantly delay the construction and opening of casinos.\nMajor construction projects entail significant risks, including shortages of materials or skilled labor; unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems; work stoppages; weather interference; unanticipated cost increases; and non-availability of construction equipment. These factors or other delays or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay, or prevent the construction or opening of any of the planned casino development, or otherwise affect its design.\nBecause our operating results are highly dependent on the timing of any projects under development, delays could cause our results to fluctuate significantly and may adversely affect our profitability, cash flow and financial condition.\nFailure of existing or other potential casino projects to successfully compete may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive. Gaming activities include: traditional land-based casinos and gaming machines; river boat and dockside gaming; casino gaming on Indian land; state-sponsored lotteries and video poker in restaurants, bars and hotels; pari-mutuel betting on horse racing and dog racing; sports bookmaking; online gaming; and card rooms. The casinos owned or gaming facilities invested in by us compete, and will in the future compete, with all these forms of gaming, and will compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in additional jurisdictions, as well as with other types of entertainment.\nWe also currently compete with other gaming companies for opportunities to acquire legal gaming sites in emerging and established gaming jurisdictions and for the opportunity to develop and/or manage casinos on Indian land. Many of our competitors have more personnel and may have greater financial and other resources than us. Such competition in the gaming industry could adversely affect our ability to attract customers which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, further expansion of gaming into new jurisdictions could also adversely affect our business by diverting customers from our casinos to competitors in such jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws, regulations and ordinances (including tribal and/or local laws) applicable to gaming facilities, we may be unable to operate or develop casino projects.\nThe ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws, and regulations and ordinances, which are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations, and often require such parties to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals.\nThe rapidly-changing political and regulatory environment governing the gaming industry (including gaming operations which are conducted on Indian land) makes it impossible for us to accurately predict the effects that an adoption of or changes in the gaming laws, regulations and ordinances will have on us. However, our failure, or the failure of any of our key personnel, significant shareholders, or joint venture partners, to obtain or retain required gaming regulatory licenses could prevent us from expanding into new markets, prohibit us from generating revenues in certain jurisdictions, and subject us to sanctions and fines.\nDefaults, downgrades, widening credit spreads or other events impairing the value of the fixed maturity securities that we invest in could adversely affect us.\nAt December 28, 2014, we had $46.6 million in short-term investments which are invested in commercial paper, certificates of deposit and corporate bonds. These short-term investments represented approximately 38% of our total assets. We are subject to the risk that the issuers, guarantors, and/or counterparties of the fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and/or interest payments they owe us. Our investments in these securities represent an unsecured obligation of the issuer. In these cases, many factors can influence the overall creditworthiness of the issuer and ultimately its ability to service and repay our holdings. This can include changes in the global economy; the company's assets, strategy, or management; shifts in the dynamics of the industries in which they compete; their access to additional funding; and the overall health of the credit markets.\nOur investments in certificates of deposit are federally-insured. All of our investments in commercial paper and corporate bonds carry a rating by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Any change in such rating agencies' approach to evaluating credit and assigning an opinion could negatively impact the fair value of our investments. Any credit-related declines in the fair value of any of our investments we believe are not temporary in nature will negatively impact our net income through impairment losses.\nIn addition to our exposure to the underlying credit strength of various issuers of fixed maturity securities, we are also exposed to credit spreads, primarily related to market pricing and variability of future cash flows associated with credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads could reduce the value of our existing investments and create unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. This could, however, increase the net investment income on new credit investments. Conversely, a tightening of credit spreads could increase the value of our existing portfolio and create unrealized gains on our investment portfolio. This could reduce the net investment income available to us on new credit investments.\nThe amounts due to us from the Jamul Tribe will likely not be paid unless and until the Jamul Tribe opens a gaming facility on its reservation.\nWe terminated our agreement with the Jamul Tribe in March 2012. As of the date of termination, we had advanced approximately $57.5 million including accrued interest to the Jamul Tribe related to casino development efforts. As a result of the application of applicable accounting standards, upon termination of our agreement with the Jamul Tribe, we wrote down the value of the notes receivable from the Jamul Tribe to zero. Under the agreement relating to the Merger, it is contemplated than any proceeds received by us as a result of the monetization of these notes within three years of the opening of a casino by the Jamul Tribe would, subject to certain exceptions, be distributed to our shareholders, excluding the current shareholder of Golden Gaming, at such time, if ever, it is received. Although the Jamul Tribe remains obligated to repay all advances including accrued interest, it is not contemplated that the Jamul Tribe will have sufficient funds to make such payments unless it opens a gaming facility on its reservation. We continue to have a subordinated collateral interest in all revenues from any future casino owned by the Jamul Tribe and in such casino\u2019s furnishings and equipment. Although Penn National is pursuing the development of a casino with the Jamul Tribe, we cannot be assured that we will ultimately be able to monetize the notes from the Jamul Tribe or that amounts owing thereunder will be repaid at all or ever.\nWe are dependent on the ongoing services of our senior corporate management, and the loss of their services could have a detrimental effect on the pursuit of our business objectives, profitability and the price of our common stock.\nOur success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior corporate management, particularly Lyle Berman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Berman or other members of senior corporate management could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data.\nWe collect information relating to our guests for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage lawsuits and other claims against our directors.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, to the fullest extent permitted by Minnesota law, that our directors shall have no personal liability for breaches of their fiduciary duties to us. In addition, our bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Minnesota law. These provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their duty.\nOur Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 100 million shares of capital stock, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors, without further action by our shareholders. The Board of Directors may authorize additional classes or series of shares that may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemptive rights and sinking fund provisions that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock and reduce the value of our common stock. Additional classes of stock that may be authorized by our Board of Directors for issuance in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if a majority of our holders of common stock approved of such acquisition.\nThe rights that have been and may in the future be granted to our shareholders may allow our Board of Directors and management to deter a potential acquisition of our company.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted an amended and restated shareholder rights agreement effective as of January 25, 2015, to help protect our ability to utilize the tax benefits of certain loss carryforwards. The rights under this agreement will expire on January 25, 2016, unless our shareholders approve the agreement, in which case the rights will continue in effect until the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger unless, prior to such time, the Board of Directors has determined that the loss carryforwards are no longer available to be utilized or are immaterial to our business. Under the rights agreement, rights to purchase common stock were issued to holders of common stock as of December 12, 2013, the original date of adoption of the rights agreement. These rights become exercisable under certain circumstances in which someone acquires 5% or more, subject to certain exceptions, of our outstanding common stock. As a result of the agreement, anyone wishing to take over the company may be forced under certain circumstances to negotiate a transaction with our Board of Directors and management or comply with certain bid criteria in order not to trigger the exercise of rights. The need to negotiate with the Board of Directors or management or to comply with certain bid criteria could add complexity to a proposed takeover.\nOur shareholders may be required to provide information that is requested by gaming authorities and we have the right, under certain circumstances, to redeem a shareholder\u2019s securities.\nOur Articles of Incorporation require our shareholders to provide information that is requested by authorities that regulate our current or proposed gaming operations. Our Articles of Incorporation also permit us to redeem the securities held by persons whose status as a security holder, in the opinion of the Lakes\u2019 Board of Directors, jeopardizes existing gaming licenses or approvals of Lakes or its subsidiaries. The price paid for these securities is, in general, the average closing price for the 30 trading days prior to giving notice of redemption.\nWe may be forced to use our cash or incur debt to fund redemption of our securities.\nIn the event a shareholder\u2019s background or status jeopardizes our current or proposed gaming licensure, we may be required to redeem such shareholder\u2019s securities in order to continue gaming operations or obtain a gaming license. This redemption may divert our cash resources from other productive uses and require us to obtain additional financing which, if in the form of equity financing, would be dilutive to our shareholders. Further, any debt financing may involve additional restrictive covenants and further leveraging of our finite assets. The inability to obtain additional financing to redeem a disqualified shareholder\u2019s securities may result in the loss of a current or potential gaming license.\nThe price of our common stock may be adversely affected by significant price fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022 obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals for potential casino development projects or the Merger;\n\u2022 litigation surrounding our casino development projects or the Merger;\n\u2022 our ability to successfully complete the Merger;\n\u2022 the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u2022 changes in prices of our or our competitors\u2019 products and services;\n\u2022 changes in our revenue and revenue growth rates;\n\u2022 changes in earnings or (loss) per share estimates by market analysts or speculation in the press or analyst community;\n\u2022 future sales of our common stock or securities linked to our common stock; and\n\u2022 general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries.\nWe have issued numerous options to acquire our common stock and have the ability to issue additional options, each of which could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.\nAs of December 28, 2014, we had options outstanding to acquire 0.8 million shares of our common stock, exercisable at prices ranging from $3.78 to $12.85 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $6.09 per share. As of December 28, 2014, there were 276,635 remaining shares available to grant under the existing stock option plans.\nThe market price of our common stock may be reduced by future sales of our common stock in the public market.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including sales of common stock that are not currently freely tradable, or even the potential for such sales, could have an adverse effect on the market price for shares of our common stock and could impair the ability of purchasers of our common stock to recoup their investment or make a profit. As of December 28, 2014, these shares consist of approximately 3.9 million shares beneficially owned by our executive officers and directors.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nAs previously announced, on January 25, 2015 we entered into a Merger Agreement with Sartini Gaming, Inc. pursuant to which we will issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Golden Gaming. The Merger, whether or not consummated, may result in a loss of key personnel and may disrupt our other key business activities, including our relationships with third parties and ongoing pursuit of strategic relationships, which may have an adverse impact on our financial performance. The Merger Agreement in general requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger, but includes certain contractual restrictions on the conduct of our business that may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial goals. In addition, with certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement prohibits us from, among other things, declaring any dividends, granting any stock options or restricted stock or repurchasing shares of our common stock, in each case prior to the earlier of the consummation of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial financial, legal and other professional fees and expenses in connection with the Merger, most of which must be paid even if the Merger is not completed.\nWe may fail to complete the Merger if certain required conditions, many of which are outside of our control, are not satisfied.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to various customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) approval by Lakes\u2019 shareholders of the issuance of shares of Lakes common stock under the Merger Agreement, (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (if applicable), (iii) certain gaming approvals having been obtained from the relevant gaming authorities, (iv) the absence of any order or injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (v) no material adverse effect or other specified adverse events occurring with respect to Lakes or Golden Gaming, (vi) the refinancing or amendment of certain indebtedness of Golden Gaming, (vii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties, and (viii) performance and compliance in all material respects with agreements and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement.\nDespite our best efforts, we may not be able to satisfy or receive in a timely fashion the various closing conditions and obtain the necessary approvals, and such failure or delay in completing the Merger may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our performance, financial condition, results of operations, price per share of our common stock and perceived acquisition value.\nFailure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFailure to complete the Merger could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. If the conditions to completion of the Merger are not met or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, we will be subject to several risks, including without limitation, (i) the price of our common stock may decline if the Merger is not completed, to the extent our current stock price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will occur; (ii) we will remain liable for significant transaction costs that would be payable even if the Merger is not completed; (iii) a failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community; (iv) matters related to the Merger have required and may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management that could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities that would have been beneficial to us; and (v) any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our employees, vendors, and customers could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement and ancillary agreements contain provisions that could discourage or limit our ability to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal to the Merger. The Merger Agreement prohibits us from initiating, soliciting or knowingly encouraging the submission of, or participating in any discussions or negotiations with respect to certain alternative acquisition proposals with third parties, subject to the exceptions in the Merger Agreement. In addition, Lyle Berman and other certain significant shareholders affiliated with Mr. Berman or another of Lakes' directors have entered into a voting and support agreement with Golden Gaming, pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to vote in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and to vote against any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties, or may discourage an otherwise interested third party from considering or proposing an alternative acquisition transaction, even one that could result in greater value to our shareholders than the value resulting from the Merger. Although we are permitted in certain circumstances to consider proposals that may lead to a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d (as defined in the Merger Agreement), a potential break-up fee may result in a third party offering a lower value to our shareholders or discourage third parties altogether from pursuing an acquisition proposal with respect to us.\nFor these and other reasons, failure to consummate the Merger could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our business, employees, and operations may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed. They could also cause those who do business with us to seek to change existing business relationships or cease doing business with us. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Merger because of the uncertainty regarding their employment status and future. If key employees depart because of these issues, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the Merger is completed without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us.\nIn the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our Board of Directors seeks another merger, business combination, or strategic opportunity, we may not be successful in locating a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the merger consideration provided in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $5.0 million to Golden Gaming or reimburse Golden Gaming for fees and expenses it incurred in an amount not to exceed $0.5 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us for greater merger consideration and may require us to pay a termination fee.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to us that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the Merger. These provisions include a general prohibition on us from soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions.\nIn addition, we may be required to pay to Golden Gaming a termination fee of $5.0 million or reimburse Golden Gaming for fees and expenses that it incurred in an amount not to exceed $0.5 million in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions.\nShareholder litigation against us or our directors could delay or prevent the Merger and cause us to incur significant costs and expenses.\nAs described in the section \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d included in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we, our merger subsidiary, Golden Gaming, its sole director and shareholder, along with members of our Board of Directors have been named as defendants in various lawsuits related to the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger with Golden Gaming. As is common for these types of claims, the lawsuits allege that in negotiating the Merger Agreement and related transactions and documentation, the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to our shareholders and/or have aided and abetted such breaches. Such claims seek, among other things, injunctive relief and an order requiring our relevant directors to pay restitution and/or compensatory damages. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no restraining order, injunction, judgment, order or decree, shall be in effect that prohibits the consummation of the Merger. Consequently, any lawsuit with respect to the Merger may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame, or at all. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit, the claims could result in delay of the closing of the Merger and the defense of these claims may be expensive, including expenses incurred with respect to the indemnification of our officers and directors with respect to such claims, and may divert other resources and management\u2019s attention, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have and will continue to incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Merger, combining the operations of the two companies, seeking required regulatory approvals, and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, severance and benefit costs, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Lakes and Golden Gaming. These costs may be higher than expected and could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and operating results.\nWe will issue a large number of shares of common stock in connection with the Merger, which will result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn connection with the Merger, we have agreed to issue shares of our common stock as merger consideration to the stockholders of Golden Gaming. The issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the Merger will result in substantial percentage dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interests, and because a substantial portion of the purchase price could be classified as goodwill and other intangible assets, the tangible net book value per share of our common stock may be materially lower after the completion of the Merger. Our issuance of these shares also may have an adverse impact on our net income per share in fiscal periods that include (or follow) the date of the Merger, as we anticipate that the transaction will be dilutive on the basis of net earnings per common share for the foreseeable future following the Merger.\nAs shares of our common stock issued in the Merger become eligible for resale, the sale of those shares could adversely impact our stock price.\nAll of the shares of our common stock issued in connection with the Merger will be restricted stock, subject to trading restrictions unless and until such time as they are registered. In connection with the Merger, Lakes is also entering into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which it may be obligated to register the shares of common stock issued in connection with the Merger. At such time as they are registered, a substantial number of shares of our common stock will become eligible for resale. Our stock price may suffer a significant decline as a result of the sudden increase in the number of shares sold in the public market or market perception that the increased number of shares available for sale will exceed the demand for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 86578, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "GDEN"}
