{"cik": "76321", "company": "PARKER DRILLING CO /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur businesses involve a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K, including Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. While these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider, they are not the only risks or uncertainties facing us or which may adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from bankruptcy may adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, vendors, contractors, employees or suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nkey suppliers, vendors or other contract counterparties may terminate their relationships with us or require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us;\n\u2022\nour ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives may be adversely affected; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of the Board changed significantly. Our Board currently consists of six directors, only one of whom served on the Board prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on our Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. There is no guarantee that our new Board will pursue, or pursue in the same manner, our current strategic plans. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe volatility of prices for oil and natural gas has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOil and natural gas prices and market expectations regarding potential changes in these prices are volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices and expectations of future prices could have an impact on our customers\u2019 long-term exploration and development activities, which in turn could materially affect our business and financial performance. Furthermore, higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result immediately in increased drilling activity because our customers\u2019 expectations of future oil and natural gas prices typically drive demand for our drilling services. The oil and natural gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by\ndiminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A prolonged downturn in the oil and natural gas industry could result in a further reduction in demand for oilfield services and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Oil and natural gas prices and demand for our services also depend upon numerous factors which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding future energy prices;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development, and production technology;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and prices;\n\u2022\nthe level of production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nthe adoption or repeal of laws and government regulations, both in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nthe imposition or lifting of economic sanctions against certain regions, persons, and other entities;\n\u2022\nthe number of ongoing and recently completed rig construction projects which may create overcapacity;\n\u2022\nlocal and worldwide military, political, and economic events, including events in the oil producing regions of Africa, the Middle East, Russia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus, or any government response to such occurrence or threat;\n\u2022\nexpansion or contraction of worldwide economic activity, which affects levels of consumer and industrial demand;\n\u2022\nthe rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policies;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nincreased demand for alternative energy sources and electric vehicles, including government initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources and the growing public sentiment around alternatives to oil and gas; and\n\u2022\nthe policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves.\nDemand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and natural gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and natural gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDemand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures for the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas reserves by the major, independent, and national oil and natural gas E&P companies and large integrated service companies that comprise our customer base. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas, including a heightened emphasis by E&P companies\u2019 investors demanding cash flow returns which has limited the number of wells being drilled. Declines in oil and natural gas prices have and may continue to result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, any of which could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Historically, when drilling activity and spending decline, utilization and dayrates also decline and drilling may be reduced or discontinued, resulting in an oversupply of drilling rigs. Sustained low oil prices have in turn caused a significant decline in the demand for drilling services over the last several years. Furthermore, operators implemented significant reductions in capital spending in their budgets, including the cancellation or deferral of existing programs, and are expected to continue to operate under reduced budgets for the foreseeable future.\nWe have a significant amount of high interest debt. Our debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may have significant consequences for our future prospects, including limiting our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing or refinancing existing high interest debt and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had:\n\u2022\n$177.9 million principal amount of debt;\n\u2022\n$41.3 million of undiscounted operating lease liabilities; and\n\u2022\n$9.3 million in supporting letters of credit.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur negative cash flows from one or more segments of our operating activities. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be influenced by the demand for our drilling services, the utilization of our rigs, the dayrates that we receive for our rigs, demand for our rental tools, oil and natural gas prices, general economic conditions, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may have to take one or more of the following actions:\n\u2022\ndelay spending on capital projects, including maintenance projects and the acquisition or construction of additional rigs, rental tools, and other assets;\n\u2022\nissue additional equity;\n\u2022\nsell assets; or\n\u2022\nrestructure or refinance our debt.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness, including limiting our liquidity and our ability to pursue other business opportunities.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to certain limitations, including under the Credit Facility and the Term Loan Agreement. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase. Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. Additionally, our Credit Facility provides, and any future credit facilities may provide, for variable interest rates, which may increase or decrease our interest expense. Furthermore, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nWe are subject to various covenants and events of default under the Credit Facility and the Term Loan Agreement. In general, certain of these covenants limit our ability, subject to certain exceptions, to take certain actions, including:\n\u2022\nselling assets outside the ordinary course of business\u037e\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging, amalgamating, liquidating, dividing, winding up, dissolving or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of its assets\u037e\n\u2022\ngranting liens; and\n\u2022\nfinancing its investments.\nIf we fail to comply with these covenants or an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility or the Term Loan Agreement, our liquidity, financial condition or operations may be materially impacted.\nOur current operations and future growth may require significant additional capital, and the amount and terms of our indebtedness could impair our ability to fund our capital requirements.\nOur business requires substantial capital. We may require additional capital in the event of growth opportunities, unanticipated maintenance requirements, or significant departures from our current business plan.\nAdditional financing may not be available on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in the Credit Facility. Failure to obtain additional financing, should the need for it develop, could impair our ability to fund capital expenditure requirements and meet debt service requirements and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur backlog of contracted revenues may not be fully realized and may reduce significantly in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur expected revenues under existing contracts (\u201ccontracted revenues\u201d) may not be fully realized due to a number of factors, including rig or equipment downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause downtime or a suspension of operations, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nbreakdowns of our equipment or the equipment of others necessary for continuation of operations;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, including labor strikes;\n\u2022\nshortages of material and skilled labor;\n\u2022\nsevere weather or harsh operating conditions;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus, or any government response to such occurrence or threat;\n\u2022\nthe early termination of contracts; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure events.\nLiquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate, cancel, or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons. Some of our contracts permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), generally exercisable upon advance notice to us and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us. There can be no assurance that our customers will be able or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us.\nSignificant declines in oil prices, the perceived risk of low oil prices for an extended period, and the resulting downward pressure on utilization may cause some customers to consider early termination of select contracts despite having to pay early termination fees in some cases. In addition, customers may request to re-negotiate the terms of existing contracts. Furthermore, as our existing contracts roll off, we may be unable to secure replacement contracts for our rigs, equipment or services. We have been in discussions with some of our customers regarding these issues. Therefore, revenues recorded in future periods could differ materially from our current contracted revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCertain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with little or no notice.\nIn periods of extended market weakness similar to the current environment, our customers may not be able to honor the terms of existing contracts, may terminate contracts even where there may be onerous termination fees, or may seek to renegotiate contract dayrates and terms in light of depressed market conditions. Certain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with relatively little or no notice. Significant declines in oil prices, the perceived risk of low oil prices for an extended period, and the resulting downward pressure on utilization may cause some customers to consider early termination of select contracts despite having to pay early termination fees in some cases. When drilling market conditions are depressed, a customer may no longer need a rig or rental tools currently under contract or may be able to obtain comparable equipment at lower dayrates. Further, due to government actions, a customer may no longer be able to operate in, or it may not be economical to operate in, certain regions. As a result, customers may leverage their termination rights in an effort to renegotiate contract terms.\nOur customers may also seek to terminate contracts for cause, such as the loss of or major damage to the drilling unit or other events that cause the suspension of drilling operations beyond a specified period of time. If we experience operational problems or if our equipment fails to function properly and cannot be repaired promptly, our customers will not be able to engage in drilling operations and may have the right to terminate the contracts. If equipment is not timely delivered to a customer or does not pass acceptance testing, a customer may in certain circumstances have the right to terminate the contract. The payment of a termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Early termination of a contract may result in a rig or other equipment being idle for an extended period of time. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness. The cancellation or renegotiation of a number of our contracts could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.\nService contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in service contracts with non-governmental customers.\nWe currently provide services and own rigs and other equipment that may be used in connection with projects involving national oil companies. In the future, we may expand our international operations and enter into additional, significant contracts or subcontracts relating to projects with national oil companies. The terms of these contracts may require us to resolve disputes in jurisdictions with less robust legal systems and may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, environmental, operational, and other risks than we assume in other contracts. These contracts may also expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs or amount of equipment and services contracted to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks. Risks that accompany contracts relating to projects with national oil companies could ultimately have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few major customers. The loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us.\nA substantial percentage of our revenues are generated from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us. ENL accounted for approximately 29.3 percent and 31.2 percent of our total consolidated revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively. Our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers terminate their contracts with us, fail to renew our existing contracts, or do not award new contracts to us.\nA slowdown in economic activity may result in lower demand for our drilling and drilling-related services and rental tools business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA slowdown in economic activity in the United States or abroad could lead to uncertainty in corporate credit availability and capital market access and could reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Concerns about global economic conditions have had a significant adverse impact on domestic and international financial markets and commodity prices, including oil and natural gas. Likewise, economic conditions in the United States or abroad could impact our vendors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to meet obligations to provide materials and services in general. Global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the recent coronavirus, may adversely affect the Company by (i) reducing demand for its services because of reduced global or national economic activity and (ii) affecting the health of its workforce, rendering employees unable to work or travel. All of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe contract drilling and the rental tools businesses are highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nThe contract drilling and rental tools markets are highly competitive and many of our competitors in both the contract drilling and rental tools businesses may possess greater financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors are incorporated in countries that may provide them with significant tax advantages that are not available to us as a U.S. company and which may impair our ability to compete with them for many projects.\nContract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Many drilling and workover rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, provided market conditions warrant, which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area. Many competitors construct rigs during periods of high energy prices and, consequently, the number of rigs available in some of the markets in which we operate can exceed the demand for rigs for extended periods of time, resulting in intense price competition. Most drilling contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. Historically, the drilling service industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high demand, limited equipment supply and high dayrates often followed by periods of low demand, excess equipment supply and low dayrates. Periods of low demand and excess equipment supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in equipment being idle for long periods of time. During periods of decreased demand we typically experience significant reductions in dayrates and utilization. The Company, or its competition, may move rigs or other equipment from one geographic location to another location; the cost of which may be substantial. If we experience further reductions in dayrates or if we cannot keep our equipment utilized, our financial performance will be adversely impacted. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.\nRig upgrade, refurbishment and construction projects are subject to risks and uncertainties, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe regularly make significant expenditures in connection with upgrading and refurbishing our rig fleet. These activities include planned upgrades to maintain quality standards, routine maintenance and repairs, changes made at the request of customers, and changes made to comply with environmental or other regulations. Rig upgrade, refurbishment, and construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including the following:\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering problems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated change orders;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nunexpectedly long delivery times for manufactured rig components;\n\u2022\nunanticipated repairs to correct defects in construction not covered by warranty;\n\u2022\nfailure or delay of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;\n\u2022\nunforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor or raw materials, particularly steel;\n\u2022\ndisputes with customers, shipyards or suppliers;\n\u2022\nlatent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nfinancial or other difficulties with current customers at shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues associated with downtime to remedy malfunctioning equipment not covered by warranty;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues and payments of liquidated damages for downtime to perform repairs associated with defects, unanticipated equipment refurbishment and delays in commencement of operations; and\n\u2022\nlack of ability to obtain the required permits or approvals, including import/export documentation.\nAny one of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Delays in the delivery of rigs being constructed or undergoing upgrade, refurbishment, or repair may, in many cases, delay commencement of a drilling contract resulting in a loss of revenues to us, and may also cause our customer to renegotiate the drilling contract for the rig or terminate or shorten the term of the contract under applicable late delivery clauses, if any. If one of these contracts is terminated, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, actual expenditures for required upgrades or to refurbish or construct rigs could exceed our planned capital expenditures, impairing our ability to service our debt obligations.\nOur international operations are subject to governmental regulation and other risks.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations. For the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we derived approximately 56.7 percent of our revenues from operations in countries other than the United States. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we derived approximately 57.9 percent of our revenues from operations in countries other than the United States. Our international operations are subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability, war, terrorism, and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\neconomic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government against other countries, groups, or individuals, or economic sanctions imposed by other governments against the U.S. or businesses incorporated in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, and nationalization of our assets;\n\u2022\nforeign laws and governmental regulation, including inconsistencies and unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, and changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nincreases in governmental royalties;\n\u2022\nimport-export quotas or trade barriers;\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining skilled and experienced workers, some of whom are represented by foreign labor unions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ndamage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnapping;\n\u2022\npiracy of vessels transporting our people or equipment;\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in foreign monetary and tax policies;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by government officials for improper payments or other forms of corruption;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u2022\nrepudiation, nullification, modification, or renegotiation of contracts; and\n\u2022\nother forms of governmental regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe currently have operations in 19 countries. Our operations are subject to interruption, suspension, and possible expropriation due to terrorism, war, civil disturbances, political and capital instability, and similar events, and we have previously suffered loss of revenues and damage to equipment due to political violence. Civil and political disturbances in international locations may affect our operations. We may not be able to obtain insurance policies covering risks associated with these types of events, especially political violence coverage, and such policies may only be available with premiums that are not commercially reasonable.\nOur international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of countries with political, regulatory and judicial systems and regimes that may differ significantly from those in the U.S. Our ability to compete in international contract drilling and rental tool markets may be adversely affected by foreign governmental regulations and/or policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which nationals of those foreign countries have substantial ownership interests or by regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Furthermore, our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to us.\nIn addition, tax and other laws and regulations in some foreign countries are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional, and national authorities, which can result in disputes between us and governing authorities. The ultimate outcome of these disputes is never certain, and it is possible that the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nA portion of the workers we employ in our international operations are members of labor unions or otherwise subject to collective bargaining. We may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled and experienced workers for wages and other benefits that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nWe may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received or expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not take protective measures against exposure to a foreign currency. We may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange, or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Given the international scope of our operations, we are exposed to risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation. We attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation where possible by obtaining contracts payable in U.S. dollars or freely convertible foreign currency. In addition, some parties with which we do business could require that all or a portion of our revenues be paid in local currencies. Foreign currency fluctuations, therefore, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the export and re-export of certain goods, services, and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons, and entities. For example, over the past several years the U.S. Government has imposed additional sanctions against Russia\u2019s oil and gas industry and certain Russian companies and individuals. Our ability to engage in certain future projects in Russia or involving certain Russian customers is dependent upon whether or not our involvement in such projects is restricted under U.S. or EU sanctions laws and the extent to which any of our prospective operations in Russia or with certain Russian customers may be subject to those\nlaws. The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control, and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments, unscheduled operational downtime and other operational disruptions. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments, and loss of import and export privileges. Reputational damage can also result from any failure to comply with such obligations.\nOur acquisitions, dispositions, and investments may not result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments, or joint ventures. These transactions are intended to result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the offering of new products or services, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk. These transactions may also affect our consolidated results of operations.\nThese transactions also involve risks, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nany acquisitions would result in an increase in income or earnings per share;\n\u2022\nany acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u2022\nthe due diligence prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, or that we will appropriately quantify the exposure from known risks;\n\u2022\nany disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash flow;\n\u2022\nuse of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses;\n\u2022\nany dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not divert management resources; or\n\u2022\nany dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, could result in fines, criminal penalties, negative commercial consequences and an adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing improper benefits for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. However, we operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption. If we are found to be liable for violations of these laws either due to our own acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others (including our joint ventures partners, our agents or other third-party representatives), we could suffer from commercial, civil, and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel could affect our operations.\nWe require skilled, trained, and experienced personnel to provide our customers with the highest quality technical services and support for our drilling operations. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience we require. Competition for skilled labor and other labor required for our operations intensifies as the number of rigs activated or added to worldwide fleets or under construction increases, creating upward pressure on wages. In periods of high utilization, we have found it more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. A shortage in the available labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. Increases in our operating costs could adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, the shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel could negatively affect the quality, safety, and timeliness of our operations.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks associated with our business.\nWe ordinarily maintain insurance against certain losses and liabilities arising from our operations. However, we do not insure against all operational risks in the course of our business. Due to the high cost, high self-insured retention, and limited coverage insurance for windstorms in the GOM we have elected not to purchase windstorm insurance for our inland barges in the\nGOM. Although we have retained the risk for physical loss or damage for these rigs arising from a named windstorm, we have procured insurance coverage for removal of a wreck caused by a windstorm. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial position, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to hazards customary for drilling operations, which could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately indemnified or insured.\nSubstantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure, and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather, and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations, or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations, and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards. Typically, we are indemnified by our customers for injuries and property damage resulting from these types of events (except for injury to our employees and subcontractors and property damage to ours and our subcontractors\u2019 equipment). However, we could be exposed to significant loss if adequate indemnity provisions or insurance are not in place, if indemnity provisions are unenforceable or otherwise invalid, or if our customers are unable or unwilling to satisfy any indemnity obligations. We may not be able to insure against these risks or to obtain indemnification to adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards and risks described above. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or for which we are not indemnified, or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks. For example, pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Even if such insurance is available, insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future, making the cost of such insurance prohibitive. For a description of our indemnification obligations and insurance, see Item 1. Business - Insurance and Indemnification.\nCertain areas in and near the GOM are subject to hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. When operating in and near the GOM, our drilling rigs and rental tools may be located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage or total loss by these storms. In addition, damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas to our rigs, our shore bases, and our corporate infrastructure could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the effects of the damage can be repaired. In addition, our rigs in arctic regions can be affected by seasonal weather so severe that conditions are deemed too unsafe for operations.\nGovernment regulations may reduce our business opportunities and increase our operating costs.\nGovernment regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee privacy and safety, environmental protection, pollution control, and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, including species protections, prohibit access to some locations and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs, and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations, such as those related to climate change, emissions, and hydraulic fracturing, may discourage our customers\u2019 activities, reducing demand for our products and services. We may be liable for damages resulting from pollution and, under United States regulations, must establish financial responsibility in order to drill offshore. See Item 1. Business - Environmental Considerations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.\nSome scientific studies have suggested that emissions of greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Such studies have resulted in increased local, state, regional, national, and international attention and actions relating to issues of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, particularly emissions from fossil fuels. For example, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the UNFCCC. The U.S. was among 195 nations that participated in the creation of an international accord in December 2015, the Paris Agreement, with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016 and, as of January 2020, had been ratified by 187 of the 197 parties to the UNFCC. However, on November 4, 2019, the United States formally communicated to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from participation in the Paris Agreement, which, under the terms of the Paris Agreement, cannot become effective until November 4, 2020. The EPA has also taken action under the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, a number of states have either proposed or implemented restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. International accords such as the Paris Agreement may result in additional regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions. Other developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include but are not limited to the Kyoto Protocol; the European Union Emission Trading System; the United Kingdom\u2019s Carbon Reduction Commitment; and, in the U.S., the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, and various state programs. These\nregulations could also adversely affect market demand or pricing for our services, by affecting the price of, or reducing the demand for, fossil fuels or providing competitive advantages to competing fuels and energy sources.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business. In addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate-change legislation or regulations, our business also could be negatively affected by climate-change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns. An increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our rigs, impact our ability to conduct our operations and/or result in a disruption of our customers\u2019 operations.\nThe number and quantity of viable financing alternatives available to us may be significantly impacted by unfavorable lending and investment policies by financial institutions and insurance companies associated with concerns about environmental impacts of the oil and natural gas industry, on which our business depends, and negative views around our and our customer\u2019s efforts with respect to environmental and social matters and related governance considerations could harm the perception of the Company by certain investors or result in the exclusion of our securities from consideration by those investors.\nGlobal climate issues, including with respect to greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane and the relationship that GHGs have with climate change, continue to attract significant public and scientific attention. Certain banks, other financing sources and insurance companies have taken actions to limit available financing and insurance coverage for the oil and natural gas industry, on which our business depends. Increasingly, the actions of such financial institutions and insurance companies are informed by non-standardized \u201csustainability\u201d scores, ratings and benchmarking studies provided by various organizations that assess corporate governance related to environmental and social matters. Further, there have been efforts in recent years by members of the general financial and investment communities, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other institutional investors, to divest themselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by companies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, or that have low ratings or scores in studies and assessments of the type noted above. These entities also have been pressuring lenders to limit financing available to such companies. Because our business depends on the oil and gas industry, these efforts may have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to: restricting our and our customer\u2019s ability to access capital and financial markets in the future; reducing the demand and price for our and our customer\u2019s equity securities; and limiting our and our customer\u2019s flexibility in business development activities such as mergers, acquisitions and divestures.\nWe are regularly involved in litigation, some of which may be material.\nWe are regularly involved in litigation, claims, and disputes incidental to our business, which at times may involve claims for significant monetary amounts, some of which would not be covered by insurance. We undertake all reasonable steps to defend ourselves in such lawsuits. Nevertheless, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and any resolution which is adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of the material legal proceedings affecting us.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the demand for rental tools.\nHydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells whereby water, other liquids, sand, and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate natural gas and, oil production. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating, or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly and indirectly. Many state governments require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process and, due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. We do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities. However, these and other developments could cause operational delays or increased costs in exploration and production, which could adversely affect the demand for our rental tools.\nOur operations are subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur operations are becoming increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services. We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage (which may include personal identification information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders), processing, and\ntransmissions, as well as in our interactions with customers and suppliers. Digital technologies are subject to the risk of cyber-attacks, security breaches and other cyber incidents, which could include, among other things, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things: loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data\u037e interruption of our business operations\u037e and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, and other third parties, and may result in claims against us, including liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information. In addition, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating To Our Common Stock\nWe may become a non-reporting company if we proceed with the Stock Splits.\nOn January 29, 2020, we filed a Form 25 with the SEC to voluntarily delist our common stock from the NYSE, and we anticipate filing a Form 15 with the SEC to suspend our reporting obligations under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Stock Splits being considered by the Board. As a result of the Form 25 filing, our common stock will be deregistered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act 90 days following the filing of the Form 25. As a result, our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and trading in our stock will only occur in privately negotiated sales and potentially on an over-the-counter market, if one or more brokers continues to choose to make a market for our common stock on any such market and complies with applicable regulatory requirements; however, there can be no assurances regarding any such trading. If we file the Form 15, our common stock would be deregistered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 90 days following the filing of the Form 15. Because of the limited liquidity for our common stock, the anticipated termination of our obligation to publicly disclose financial and other information, and the proposed deregistration of our common stock under the Exchange Act, our stockholders may potentially experience a significant decrease in the liquidity of their common stock.\nIf we file a Form 15 to deregister our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, we will cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the SEC, and stockholders will cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements. Even if we file the Form 15, we intend to continue to prepare audited annual financial statements and periodic unaudited financial statements, as required pursuant to the covenants contained in our debt documents and make such financial information available to our stockholders on a voluntary basis. However, we would not be required to do so by law and there is no assurance that even if we were to make such information available that we would continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our stockholders may have significantly less information about the Company and our business, operations, and financial performance than they have currently. We would continue to hold stockholder meetings as required under Delaware law, including annual meetings, or to take actions by written consent of our stockholders in lieu of meetings as permitted under and in conformity with applicable Delaware law.\nIf we were to complete the deregistration and delisting process, we would no longer be subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the liability provisions of the Exchange Act or the oversight of a national securities exchange. Our executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders would no longer be required to file reports relating to their transactions in our common stock with the SEC. In addition, our executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders would no longer be subject to the recovery of profits provision of the Exchange Act, and persons acquiring 5% of our common stock would no longer be required to report their beneficial ownership under the Exchange Act. Additionally, we would not have the ability to access the public capital markets or to use public securities in attracting and retaining executives and other employees, and we would have a decreased ability to use common stock to acquire other companies.\nAdditionally, even if we were to complete the deregistration process, our public reporting obligations could be reinstated if on the first day of any fiscal year we have more than 300 stockholders of record, in which instance we would be required to resume reporting pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. However, the Company would reserve the right to take additional actions that may be permitted under Delaware law, including effectuating further reverse stock splits, as necessary to maintain the Company\u2019s suspension of its SEC reporting obligations.\nBecause our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, it is less liquid and its price may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our operations.\nBecause our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, it is less liquid and its price may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our operations. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in our common stock, in which case it could be difficult for shareholders to sell their shares of common stock. Even if one or more brokers chooses to make a market for our common stock on an over-the-counter market and complies with the applicable regulatory requirements,\nthe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to various factors and events, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe other risk factors described in this Form 10-K, including changes in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\na shortfall in rig utilization, operating revenues, or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of the financial performance of us or our competitors or the financial performance of companies in the oilfield service industry generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in actual or market expectations with respect to the amounts of exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the economy and in energy-related industries;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the securities markets;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, terrorism, or war;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of pending and future legal proceedings, investigations, tax assessments, and other claims; and\n\u2022trading volume in our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that any public market for our common stock will exist in the future or that we will choose or be able to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange.\nCertain shareholders own large portions of our outstanding common stock, which may limit your ability to influence our actions.\nCertain shareholders currently hold significant percentages of our common stock. To the extent a significant percentage of the ownership of our common stock is concentrated in a small number of holders, such holders will be able to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws and possible mergers, corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in the Company. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock.\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates (as defined in our certificate of incorporation) of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022\npermits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested;\n\u2022\npermits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022\nprovides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the Company or our stockholders or to have acted in a manner inconsistent with or opposed to his or her fiduciary duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty regarding the opportunity.\nThese provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our\ncommon stock respecting dividends and distributions, as the Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any: (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery; or (iv) action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that if any action specified above (each is referred to herein as a covered proceeding), is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (ii) having service of process made upon such claiming party in any such enforcement action by service upon such claiming party\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such claiming party. These provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our a certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and the terms of our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock may be limited by the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our indebtedness. The future payment of dividends on our common stock will be at the sole discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other considerations that the Board deems relevant.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K contains certain statements that may be deemed to be \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).
