{"cik": "1437557", "company": "LILIS ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our shares involves significant risks, including the potential loss of all or part of your investment. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause a decline in the market price of our shares. You should carefully consider all of the risks described in this annual report, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report, before you make an investment in our shares. In addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement. Some of these important factors, but not necessarily all important factors, include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our total outstanding debt under our convertible debentures equaled $6.84 million. We currently have a three-year senior secured term loan in an initial aggregate principal amount of $3.0 million. We also have a $2.0 million mandatory redeemable preferred stock currently valued at $1.69 million. While transactions in 2014 have significantly reduced our debt, our degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, further exploration, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u25cf a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u25cf the debt service requirements of other indebtedness in the future could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u25cf as we have pledged most of our oil and natural gas properties and the related equipment, inventory, accounts and proceeds as collateral for the borrowings under our credit facility, they may not be pledged as collateral for other borrowings and would be at risk in the event of a default thereunder;\n\u25cf it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u25cf we are vulnerable in the present downturn in general economic conditions and in our business, and we will likely be unable to carry out capital spending and exploration activities that are currently planned; and\n\u25cf we may from time to time be out of compliance with covenants under our term loan agreements, which will require us to seek waivers from our lenders, which may be difficult to obtain.\nWe may incur additional debt, including secured indebtedness, or issue preferred stock in order to maintain adequate liquidity and develop our properties to the extent desired. A higher level of indebtedness and/or preferred stock increases the risk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, natural gas and oil prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets, the number of shares of capital stock we have authorized, unissued and unreserved and our performance at the time we need capital.\nOur inability to access additional capital in significant amounts as needed, may result in our inability to develop our current prospects and properties, cause us to forfeit our interest in certain prospects and inhibit our ability to develop our business. We plan to seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of our equity or debt securities, the successful deployment of our cash on hand, bank lines of credit, joint ventures, and project financing. Consequently, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain continued access to capital as and when needed or, if so, that the terms of any available financing will be commercially reasonable. Currently, a significant portion of our revenue after field level operating expenses is required to be paid to our lenders as debt service. If we are unable to access additional capital in significant amounts as needed, we may not be able to develop our current prospects and properties, may have to forfeit our interest in certain prospects and may not otherwise be able to develop our business. In such an event, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have historically incurred losses and cannot assure investors as to future profitability. We have historically incurred losses from operations during our history in the oil and natural gas business. We had a cumulative deficit of approximately $147.82 million and $115.53 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Many of our properties are in the exploration stage, and to date we have established a limited volume of proved reserves on our properties. Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on successfully addressing our near-term capital need to refinance our term loan indebtedness and fund our 2015 capital budget, and implementing our acquisition, exploration, development and production activities, all of which are subject to many risks beyond our control. Even if we become profitable on an annual basis, we cannot assure you that our profitability will be sustainable or increase on a periodic basis.\nWe will require additional capital in order to achieve commercial success and, if necessary, to finance future losses from operations as we endeavor to build revenue, but we do not have any commitments to obtain such capital and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate capital as and when required. The business of oil and gas acquisition, drilling and development is capital intensive and the level of operations attainable by an oil and gas company is directly linked to and limited by the amount of available capital. We believe that our ability to achieve commercial success and our continued growth will be dependent on our continued access to capital either through the additional sale of our equity or debt securities, bank lines of credit, project financing, joint ventures, sale or lease of undeveloped acreage, or cash generated from oil and gas operations. We will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of our equity or debt securities, the successful deployment of our cash on hand, bank lines of credit, joint ventures, and project financing. Consequently, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain continued access to capital as and when needed or, if so, that the terms of any available financing will be commercially reasonable. If we are unable to access additional capital in significant amounts as needed, we may not be able to develop our current prospects and properties, may have to forfeit our interest in certain prospects and may not otherwise be able to develop our business. In such an event, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have limited management and staff and will be dependent upon partnering arrangements. We had three employees at the end of December 31, 2014. Subsequent to year end, we hired Kevin Nanke as our Chief Financial Officer and Ariella Fuchs as our General Counsel. We leverage the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including engineering, oil and gas well planning and supervision, and land, legal, environmental and tax services. We also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation and prospect leasing. Our dependence on third party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to:\t\n\u25cf the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed; and\n\u25cf the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects.\nIf we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer could adversely affect us. We are dependent on the experience of our executive officers to guide the implementation of our operational objectives and growth strategy. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a negative impact on our operations and our ability to implement our strategy. Our executive employment contracts include long term incentives to retain key personnel but retention of personnel is not guaranteed.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not detect errors or potential acts of fraud. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedure and internal controls will prevent all possible errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are being met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls are evaluated relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of our controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its intended goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with its policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur without detection.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, to implement Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management to include in our annual report on Form 10-K regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management.\nWe may discover areas of our internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nIn addition to acquiring producing properties, we expect to also attempt to grow our business through the acquisition and development of exploratory oil and gas prospects, which is the riskiest method of establishing oil and gas reserves. In addition to acquiring producing properties, we expect to acquire, drill and develop exploratory oil and gas prospects that may or may not be profitable to produce. Developing exploratory oil and gas properties requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial, technical and operational risk. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating exploratory wells are often exceeded due to subsurface uncertainties and can increase significantly when market drilling costs rise. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including unexpected geological issues, poor reservoir quality, title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and operational/mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling or completion of an exploratory oil or gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater investment and operational risk than development wells. We cannot assure you that our exploration, exploitation and development activities will result in profitable operations. If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and develop commercial, exploratory oil and gas prospects, our results of operations, financial condition and stock price may be materially adversely affected\nIf oil or natural gas prices decrease or exploration and development efforts are unsuccessful, wells in progress are deemed unsuccessful, or major tracts of undeveloped acreage expire, or other similar adverse events occur, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our developed properties. We use the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool. These costs include land acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenses, carrying charges on non-producing properties, costs of drilling wells, completing productive wells, or plugging and abandoning non-productive wells, costs related to expired leases, or leases underlying producing and non-producing wells, and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities. Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and natural gas property that comprise the full cost pool, less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves. This ceiling test is performed at least quarterly. Should the capitalized costs of the full cost pool exceed this ceiling, we would recognize impairment expense. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we did not recognize an impairment charge. Future write-downs could occur for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to reductions in oil and gas prices that lower the estimate of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves, revisions to reserve estimates, or from the addition of non-productive capitalized costs to the full cost pool that do not result in corresponding increase in oil and gas reserves. Impairments of undeveloped acreage and plugging and abandonment of wells in progress are other areas where costs may be capitalized into the full cost pool, without any corresponding increase in reserve values; as such, these situations could result in future additional impairment expenses.\nIf commodity prices stay at current early 2015 levels or decline further, we will incur full cost ceiling impairments in future quarters. Because the ceiling calculation uses rolling 12-month average commodity prices, the effect of lower quarter-over-quarter prices in 2015 compared to 2014 is a lower ceiling value each quarter. This will result in ongoing impairments each quarter until prices stabilize or improve. Impairment charges would not affect cash flow from operating activities, but would adversely affect our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains or result in losses. In order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, from time to time, we may enter into derivative contracts that economically hedge our oil and gas price on a portion of our production. These contracts may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the contract. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u25cf there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received;\n\u25cf our production and/or sales of oil or natural gas are less than expected;\n\u25cf payments owed under derivative hedging contracts come due prior to receipt of the hedged month\u2019s production revenue; or\n\u25cf the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations.\nHedging transactions we may enter into may not adequately protect us from declines in the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition, the counterparties under our derivatives contracts may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had no hedging agreements in place.\nOur large inventory of undeveloped acreage and large percentage of undeveloped proved reserves may create additional economic risk. Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to develop our large inventory of future drilling locations, undeveloped acreage and undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 95% of our total proved reserves and 88% of our total acreage were undeveloped. To the extent our drilling results are not as successful as we anticipate, natural gas and oil prices decline, or sufficient funds are not available to drill these locations and reserves, we may not capture the expected or projected value of these properties. As previously disclosed, 49,000 of our 57,000 undeveloped acres are subject to lease expirations in 2015. We are currently evaluating the 2015 lease expirations to determine if this acreage is a focus for future development. If determined to be a focus for future development, we plan to re-lease if available. If not a focus, we plan to let the acreage expire. In addition, delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the economic PV-10 value of and delay cash flow from our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic.\t\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Significant growth in the size and scope of our operations would place a strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial staff and control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, geologists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan.\t\nThe actual quantities and present value of our proved reserves may be lower than we have estimated. In addition, the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. This annual report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from these reserves contained in our filings with the SEC. The reserve estimate included in this annual report was prepared by our current reserve engineer consultant, reviewed by our Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer/Controller and audited by RE Davis. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering, cost basis, commodity pricing and economic data for each reservoir. Accordingly, these estimates are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development and operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from these estimates and vary over time. Such variations may be significant and could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, results of secondary and tertiary recovery applications, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should also not assume that our initial rates of production of our wells are representative of future overall production from other wells or over the life of the wells, or that early results suggesting lack of reservoir continuity will prove to be accurate.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flow referred to in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on the un-weighted average of the closing prices during the first day of each of the year preceding the end of the fiscal year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any change in global markets consumption by oil or natural gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of our oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor nor does it necessarily reflect discount factors used in the marketplace to assess asset values for the purchase and sale of oil and natural gas.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce oil or natural gas as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them, which could cause us to incur losses. One of our growth strategies is to pursue selective acquisitions of undeveloped acreage potentially containing oil and natural gas reserves. If we choose to pursue an acquisition, we will perform a review of the target properties; however, these reviews are inherently incomplete as they are based on the quality, availability and interpretation of the reviewed data, the acumen and the assumptions of the evaluation personnel. Generally, it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property, well, facility and/or file involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. We may not perform an inspection on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we may not be able to obtain effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems, and we may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the acquired properties.\nAll of our producing properties and operations are located in the DJ Basin region, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area. All of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2014, and all of our 2014 and 2013 sales were generated in the DJ Basin in southeastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado and southwestern Nebraska. Although the area is a well-established oilfield infrastructure, as a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and gas producing areas such as the DJ Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control. The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, rail service, and processing facilities in addition to competing oil and gas production available to 3rd party purchasers. We deliver crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through trucking, gathering systems and pipelines, some of which we do not own. The lack of availability of capacity on third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reliability or other reasons, including adverse weather conditions or work-loads. Activist or other efforts may delay or halt the construction of additional pipelines or facilities. Third-party systems and facilities may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay production, thereby harming our business and, in turn, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations. Drilling and completion activities require the use of water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas.\nOur success is influenced by oil, natural gas, and NGL prices in the specific areas where we operate, and these prices may be lower than prices at major markets. Regional natural gas, condensate, oil and NGLs prices may move independently of broad industry price trends. Because some of our operations are located outside major markets, we are directly impacted by regional prices regardless of Henry Hub, WTI or other major market pricing.\nUnless we find new oil and gas reserves to replace actual production, our reserves and production will decline, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Producing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates and depletion that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics subsurface and surface pressures and other factors. Thus, our future oil and gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and revenue are highly dependent on our success in efficiently obtaining additional reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire reserves to replace our current and future production at costs or other terms acceptable to us, or at all, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging unconventional shale plays using available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned exploratory and development drilling in these plays are subject to drilling and completion execution risks and drilling results may not meet our economic expectations for reserves or production. As a result, we may incur material write-downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful. Unconventional operations involve utilizing drilling and completion techniques as developed by ourselves and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, not reaching the desired objective due to drilling problems, not landing our wellbore in the desired drilling zone or specific target, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the wellbore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, mechanical integrity, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations, proper design and engineering vs. reservoir parameters, and successfully cleaning out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nOur experience with horizontal well applications utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques specifically in the Niobrara and/or Codell formations is limited; however, we contract local experts in the area to design, plan and conduct our drilling and completion operations. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be developed over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material write-downs of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment supplies or personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there are shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of and demand for rigs, equipment and supplies may increase substantially and their availability may be limited. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified personnel, including drilling rig crews, may rise as the number of rigs in service increases. The higher prices of oil and gas during the last several years have increased activity which has resulted in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, which have resulted in increased costs and delays in the areas where we operate. If drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel are unavailable to us due to excessive costs or demand or otherwise, our ability to execute our exploration and development plans could be materially and adversely affected and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCovenants in our Credit Agreement impose significant restrictions and requirements on us. Our Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants imposing significant restrictions on us, including the maximum monthly payment requirement, restrictions on our repurchase of, and payment of dividends on, our capital stock and limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, sell assets and create liens on our assets. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business, to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and, in turn, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe could be required to pay liquidated damages to some of our investors due to our failure to maintain the effectiveness of a prior registration statement. We could accrue liquidated damages under registration rights agreements covering a significant amount of shares of Common Stock if our investors declare a default, due to our failure to maintain the effectiveness of a prior registration statement as required in the agreements. In such case, we would be required to pay monthly liquidated damages. If we do not make a monthly payment within seven days after the date payable, we are required to pay interest at an annual rate of 18% on the unpaid amount. If our investors declare a default under the registration rights agreement and accrue liquidated damages, we could be required to either raise additional outside funds through financing or curtail operations.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks. Our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:\n\u25cf fire, explosions and blowouts;\n\u25cf negligence of personnel,\n\u25cf Weather\n\u25cf pipe or equipment failure;\n\u25cf abnormally pressured formations; and\n\u25cf environmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids into the environment (including groundwater contamination).\nThese events may result in substantial losses to us from:\n\u25cf injury or loss of life;\n\u25cf significantly increased costs;\n\u25cf severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u25cf pollution or other environmental damage;\n\u25cf clean-up responsibilities;\n\u25cf regulatory investigation;\n\u25cf penalties and suspension of operations; or\n\u25cf attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover these losses or liabilities. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nThe producing wells in which we have an interest occasionally experience reduced or terminated production. These curtailments can result from mechanical failures, contract terms, pipeline and processing plant interruptions, market conditions, operator priorities, and weather conditions, etc. and weather conditions. These curtailments can last from a few days to many months.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations. Information technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information, or damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u25cf recoverable reserves;\n\u25cf future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u25cf well and facility integrity;\n\u25cf development and operating costs;\n\u25cf regulatory constraints and plans; and\n\u25cf potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \"as is\" basis.\nSignificant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u25cf diversion of our management's attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u25cf challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u25cf difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u25cf challenge of attracting and retaining capable personnel associated with acquired operations; and\n\u25cf failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within the expected time frame.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management and other staff may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management and staff are not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nProspects in which we decide to participate may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities or quantities sufficient to meet our targeted rate of return. A prospect is a property in which we own an interest and contains what we believe, based on available reservoir, seismic and/or geological information, to be indications of commercial oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to be drilled to a prospect that will require substantial additional technical assessment, data acquisition and/or seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no definitive method to predict in advance of drilling and testing and wider-scale development whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. The use of reservoir, geologic and seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analysis we perform using data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be useful in predicting the characteristics and potential reserves associated with our drilling prospects.\nOur reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions ranging from subsurface parameters to economic/market factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the present value of reserves shown in these reports.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates in its reports, our independent petroleum consultant projected production rates and timing of development expenditures. Our independent petroleum consultant also analyzed available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary and may not be in our control. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, infrastructure, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, our independent petroleum consultant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, drilling results, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control due in-part to SEC guidelines.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Gas Industry\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile, and our revenue, profitability, cash flow, future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital, as well as the carrying value of our properties, are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u25cf changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d);\n\u25cf the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf acts of war or terrorism;\n\u25cf political conditions and events, including embargoes, affecting oil-producing activity;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf weather conditions;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u25cf market concerns about global warming or changes in governmental policies and regulations due to climate change initiatives.\nVolatile oil and natural gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and often cause disruption in the market for oil and natural gas producing properties, as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability and future rate of growth depend primarily upon the prices we receive for oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas that we sell. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. In addition, we may need to record asset carrying value write-downs if prices fall. A significant decline in the prices of natural gas or oil could adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our performance, including our ability to participate in ready to drill prospects in our core areas. We operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to capital, the principle resources necessary for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are:\n\u25cf leasehold prospects under which oil and natural gas reserves may be discovered;\n\u25cf drilling rigs and related equipment to explore for such reserves; and\n\u25cf knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of oil and natural gas operations.\nWe must compete for such resources with both major oil and natural gas companies and independent operators. Virtually all of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. We cannot assure you that such capital, materials and resources will be available when needed. If we are unable to access capital, material and resources when needed, we risk suffering a number of adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf the breach of our obligations under the oil and gas leases by which we hold our prospects and the potential loss of those leasehold interests;\n\u25cf loss of reputation in the oil and gas community;\n\u25cf inability to retain staff;\n\u25cf inability to attract capital;\n\u25cf a general slowdown in our operations and decline in revenue; and\n\u25cf decline in market price of our common shares.\nWe may face difficulties in securing and operating under authorizations and permits to drill, complete or operate our wells. The recent growth in oil and gas exploration in the United States has drawn intense scrutiny from environmental and community interest groups, regulatory agencies and other governmental entities. As a result, we may face significant opposition to, or increased regulation of, our operations that may make it difficult or impossible to obtain permits and other needed authorizations to drill, complete or operate, result in operational delays, or otherwise make oil and gas exploration more costly or difficult than in other countries.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA recently adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, including petroleum refineries, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities.\nEPA is also considering direct regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities. On January 14, 2015, the White House and EPA indicated that they plan to amend 40 C.F.R Part 60, Subpart OOOO (Subpart OOOO) standards to achieve additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from the oil and natural gas industry. These potential amendments to Subpart OOOO could result in additional regulatory requirements and standards for completions of hydraulically fractured oil wells, pneumatic pumps, and leaks from new and modified oil and gas exploration, production, and gathering facilities. A proposed rule is expected in 2015, with a final rule expected in 2016.\nIn June 2014, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA upheld a portion of EPA\u2019s GHG stationary source permitting program, but also invalidated a portion of it. The Court held that stationary sources already subject to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) or Title V permitting programs for non-GHG criteria pollutants remain subject to GHG Best Available Control Technology (\u201cBACT\u201d) and major source permitting requirements, but ruled that sources cannot be subject to the PSD or Title V major source permitting programs based solely on GHG emission levels. Upon remand, EPA is considering how to implement the Court\u2019s decision. The Court\u2019s holding does not prevent states from considering and adopting state-only major source permitting requirements based solely on GHG emission levels.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, NGLs, and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production by providing and linking up induced flow paths for the oil and/or gas contained in the rocks. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Under the proposed legislation, this information would be available to the public via the internet, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. As discussed above, the BLM, on March 20, 2015, issued its final regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands. The new regulations require, among other things, disclosure of chemicals, annulus pressure monitoring, flow back and produced water management and storage, and more stringent well integrity measures associated with hydraulic fracturing operations on public land. The new regulations become effective on June 24, 2015. In addition, EPA intends to propose regulations in 2015 under the federal Clean Water Act to develop standards for wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production activities. At the state level, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Some counties in Colorado, for instance, have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective. Beyond that, in 2012, Longmont, Colorado prohibited the use of hydraulic fracturing. The oil and gas industry filed a lawsuit challenging that ban in court. The industry prevailed on summary judgment against Longmont and the environmental intervenors. That decision is currently on appeal. In November 2013, four other Colorado cities and counties passed voter initiatives either placing a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or banning new oil and gas development. These initiatives too are the subject of pending legal challenge or appeal. While these initiatives cover areas with little recent or ongoing oil and gas development, they could lead opponents of hydraulic fracturing to push for statewide referendums, especially in Colorado. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nThe White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with draft results expected by 2015.. These ongoing studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.\nEPA has also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and initiated a public participation process under the Toxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d) to seek comment on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and the mechanisms for obtaining this information. Additionally, on January 7, 2015, several national environmental advocacy groups filed a lawsuit requesting that EPA add the oil and gas extraction industry to the list of industries required to report releases of certain \u201ctoxic chemicals\u201d under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act\u2019s (\u201cEPCRA\u201d) Toxics Release Inventory (\u201cTRI\u201d) program.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, production and sale of oil and natural gas, and operating safety. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may result in substantial penalties and harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, such as:\n\u25cf land use restrictions;\n\u25cf lease permit restrictions;\n\u25cf drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements, such as plugging and abandonment bonds;\n\u25cf spacing of wells;\n\u25cf unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u25cf safety precautions;\n\u25cf operational reporting; and\n\u25cf taxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u25cf personal injuries;\n\u25cf property and natural resource damages;\n\u25cf well reclamation cost; and\n\u25cf governmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. It is also possible that a portion of our oil and gas properties could be subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings for which we may not be adequately compensated. See \u201cBusiness and Properties-Government Regulations\u201d for a more detailed description of our regulatory risks.\nOur operations may incur substantial expenses and resulting liabilities from compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u25cf require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or facility mobilization and commissioning, or injection or disposal commences;\n\u25cf restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production and processing activities, including new environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells;\n\u25cf limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and\n\u25cf impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u25cf the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u25cf incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations; and\n\u25cf the imposition of injunctive relief.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to reach and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were performed. Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages. See \u201cBusiness and Properties-Government Regulations\u201d for a more detailed description of our environmental risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThere is a limited public market for our shares and we cannot assure you that an active trading market or a specific share price will be established or maintained. Our Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market, generally in small volumes each day. The value of our Common Stock could be affected by:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf changes in the market valuations of other oil and gas companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our Common Stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf actions taken by our lenders or the holders of our convertible debentures;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the market in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u25cf our failure to meet financial analysts\u2019 performance expectations; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn a volatile market, you may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our Common Stock. These fluctuations may have an extremely negative effect on the market price of our Common Stock and may prevent you from obtaining a market price equal to your purchase price when you attempt to sell our Common Stock in the open market. In these situations, you may be required either to sell at a market price which is lower than your purchase price, or to hold our Common Stock for a longer period of time than you planned. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or oil and gas properties by using Common Stock as consideration.\nWe may not satisfy the NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s requirements for continued listing. If we cannot satisfy these requirements, NASDAQ could delist our Common Stock. Our Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, under the symbol LLEX. To continue to be listed on NASDAQ, we are required to satisfy a number of conditions. In past years, we defaulted on several of these requirements and regained compliance only after we carried out capital-raising and other transactions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the NASDAQ listing requirements in the future. If we are delisted from NASDAQ, trading in our Common Stock may be conducted, if available, on the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board Service\u201d or, if available, via another market. In the event of such delisting, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our Common Stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into our Common Stock could be severely limited. In addition, if our Common Stock were delisted from NASDAQ, our Common Stock could be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the U.S. federal securities laws. Additional regulatory requirements apply to trading by broker-dealers of penny stocks that could result in the loss of an effective trading market for our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock may be subject to penny stock rules which limit the market for our Common Stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u25cf that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u25cf that broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u25cf obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u25cf make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u25cf sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u25cf that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our Common Stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2014, six investors each hold more than 5% beneficial ownership of our Common Stock, and together, hold beneficial ownership of approximately 75% of our Common Stock. Thus, any sales by our large investors of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock into the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our Common Stock. Our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our Common Stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights. We currently have two series of preferred stock issued and outstanding, both of which provide its holders with a liquidation preference and prohibit the payment of dividends on junior securities, including our Common Stock, amongst other preferences and rights.\nThere may be future dilution of our Common Stock. If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, such sales could result in increased dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline. To the extent outstanding warrants or options to purchase Common Stock under our employee and director stock option plans are exercised, the price vesting triggers under the performance shares granted to our executive officers are satisfied, or additional shares of restricted stock are issued to our employees, holders of our Common Stock will experience dilution.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock. We have never paid dividends with respect to our Common Stock, and we do not expect to pay any dividends, in cash or otherwise, in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings for use in our business. In addition, the credit agreement relating to our credit facility prohibits us from paying any dividends and the indenture governing our senior notes restricts our ability to pay dividends. In the future, we may agree to further restrictions.\nOur Common Stock is an unsecured equity interest in our Company. As an equity interest, our Common Stock is not secured by any of our assets. Therefore, in the event we are liquidated, the holders of the Common Stock will receive a distribution only after all of our secured and unsecured creditors have been paid in full. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets after paying our secured and unsecured creditors to make any distribution to the holders of the Common Stock.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage of our shares or may issue negative reports, which may adversely affect the trading price of the shares. We cannot assure you that securities analysts will cover our company. If securities analysts do not cover our company, this lack of coverage may adversely affect the trading price of our shares. The trading market for our shares will rely in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our shares, the trading price of our shares may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn, could also cause the trading price of our shares to decline. Further, because of our small market capitalization, it may be difficult for us to attract securities analysts to cover our company, which could significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our shares.", "PERMNO": 13113, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LLEXQ"}
