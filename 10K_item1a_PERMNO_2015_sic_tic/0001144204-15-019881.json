{"cik": "910267", "company": "TITAN PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFurther delays in the FDA approval process for Probuphine or termination of the license agreement by Braeburn could materially adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nWhile Braeburn has commenced the clinical study and patient enrollment is underway, we cannot predict the timing of commencement or completion of the study. At December 31, 2014, we had cash of approximately $15.5 million, which we believe is sufficient to fund our planned operations into fourth quarter of 2016. Under our license agreement, as amended, Braeburn currently has the technical right to terminate the agreement. If Braeburn were to exercise this right, we would not have sufficient funds available to us to complete the FDA regulatory process and, in the event of ultimate approval, commercialize Probuphine without raising additional capital. If we are unable to complete a debt or equity offering, or otherwise obtain sufficient financing in such event, our business and prospects would be materially adversely impacted. We cannot assure you that the financing we need will be available on acceptable terms.\nFDA approval of Probuphine may be denied.\nWhile Titan and Braeburn have agreed in principal with the FDA on a path forward for Probuphine, which along with other steps includes conducting an additional clinical study which is expected to be completed by the middle of 2015, there can be no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve the NDA. The FDA may deny approval of Probuphine for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that Probuphine is safe and effective for the treatment of opioid dependence in the targeted patient population;\n\u00b7 the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from the clinical trial;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to demonstrate that Probuphine\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh any safety or other perceived risks; or\n\u00b7 we may not be able to successfully address the other issues raised by the FDA in the CRL.\nIf Probuphine fails to receive FDA approval, our business and prospects will be materially adversely impacted.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval of Probuphine, we may never obtain approval or commercialize our products outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market Probuphine outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and may require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. In addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nWe have granted an exclusive license to Braeburn for the commercialization of Probuphine in the United States and Canada (the \u201cTerritory\u201d). If approved by the FDA, Braeburn will be solely responsible for the marketing, manufacture and commercialization of Probuphine in the Territory and, accordingly, the timing and amount of any royalty revenues or sales milestones we receive from this product will be wholly dependent upon Braeburn\u2019s ability to successfully launch and commercialize this product in the Territory. Braeburn is a recently formed company and does not have a track record upon which investors can rely on making an investment decision. Additionally, our ability to generate revenues in the Territory from any additional indications for Probuphine, including chronic pain, depends on Braeburn\u2019s ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize the product for additional indications. We do not have control over the amount and timing of resources that Braeburn will dedicate to these efforts, none of which have commenced to date. We will be similarly dependent on the development, regulatory and marketing efforts of third parties with respect to revenues, if any, from sales of Probuphine outside the Territory. To date, we have not entered into any collaborative arrangements or granted any rights with respect to Probuphine in the rest of the world.\nOur ProNeura development programs are at very early stages and will require substantial additional resources that may not be available to us.\nTo date, we have conducted limited research and development activities based on our ProNeura delivery system beyond Probuphine. We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization of ProNeura for PD or any therapeutic based on our ProNeura platform technology. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from royalties from the sale of Probuphine or other payments under our license agreement with Braeburn, we will need to seek additional sources of financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we do not succeed in raising the requisite financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to initiate clinical trials or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations. In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.\nOur ProNeura program for PD is at a very early stage and we may not be able to successfully develop this product or any other product based on our ProNeura drug delivery technology.\nOur ability to successfully develop any future product candidates based on our ProNeura drug delivery technology is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.\nBecause of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products. If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nOur development and commercialization strategy for ProNeura for PD depends, in part, upon the FDA\u2019s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of ropinirole based on data not developed by us, but upon which the FDA may rely in reviewing our NDA.\nWe are developing ProNeura for PD with the expectation that it will be eligible for approval through the regulatory pathway under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA allows an NDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of an approved drug product, which could expedite the development program for ProNeura for PD by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that would need to be generated in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for product approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for ProNeura for PD, and complications and risks associated with regulatory approval, would likely substantially increase. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway may result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than ProNeura for PD, which would adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee that this regulatory pathway will ultimately lead to accelerated product development or earlier approval for ProNeura for PD. Moreover, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA\u2019s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this result could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDAs that we submit. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of ProNeura for PD. The FDA may require us to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes in our product as compared to the approved product. If we utilize Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may approve our new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by us.\nClinical trials required for new product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product based on our ProNeura drug delivery technology, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans. To meet these requirements, we must conduct \u201cadequate and well controlled\u201d clinical trials. Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial. Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses. The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMP, for use in clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical trial protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials; the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of the trials.\nThe results from early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future clinical trials. Clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically significant safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.\nThe failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates. This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf Probuphine or any other product candidate that we may successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that it generates from their sales will be limited.\nEven if Probuphine or any other product candidate we may in the future develop receives regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u00b7 acceptance by physicians, operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective product;\n\u00b7 the potential and perceived advantages of the product over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the safety of the product in broader patient groups, including its use outside of approved indications;\n\u00b7 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals and clinics, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate significant revenue from such products.\nWe must comply with extensive government regulations.\nThe research, development, manufacture labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA in the U.S. and comparable health authorities in foreign markets. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Approval policies or regulations may change and the FDA and foreign authorities have substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. Regulatory approval may entail limitations on the indicated usage of a drug, which may reduce the drug\u2019s market potential. Even if regulatory clearance is obtained, post-market evaluation of the products, if required, could result in restrictions on a product\u2019s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval process and are commercialized.\nWe are dependent upon key collaborative relationships and license agreements.\nWe will rely significantly on the resources of third parties to market and commercialize Probuphine, if approved, as well as any other products we may develop. For example, our ability to ultimately derive revenues from Probuphine in the United States and Canada is dependent upon Braeburn implementing a successful marketing program for the treatment of opioid dependence in adults and pursuing development and commercialization of the product for other indications. Beyond any contractual rights, we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that any existing or future corporate partner devotes to product development and commercialization efforts for our product candidates. We depend on our ability to maintain existing collaborative relationships, to develop new collaborative relationships with third parties and potentially to acquire or in-license additional products and technologies for the development of new product candidates.\nOur dependence on third party collaborators and license agreements subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 our collaborators may not comply with applicable regulatory guidelines with respect to developing or commercializing our products, which could adversely impact sales or future development of our products;\n\u00b7 we and our collaborators could disagree as to future development plans and our collaborators may delay, fail to commence or stop future clinical trials or other development; and\n\u00b7 there may be disputes between us and our collaborators, including disagreements regarding the license agreements, that may result in the delay of or failure to achieve developmental, regulatory and commercial objectives that would result in milestone or royalty payments and/or the delay or termination of any future development or commercialization of our products.\nIn addition, collaborators may, to the extent permitted by our agreements, develop products that divert resources from our products, preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors or terminate their agreements with us prematurely. For example, Braeburn recently announced that it has obtained an exclusive license from Camurus for its long-acting bupenorphine injectables under development, which, if approved, could in the future divert resources from Probuphine. Moreover, disagreements could arise with our collaborators or strategic partners over rights to our intellectual property and our rights to share in any of the future revenues from products or technologies resulting from use of our technologies, or our activities in separate fields may conflict with other business plans of our collaborators.\nWe face risks associated with third parties conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products; as well as our dependence on third parties to manufacture any products that we may successfully develop.\nWe depend on third-party laboratories and medical institutions to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials for our products and other third-party organizations to perform data collection and analysis, all of which must maintain both good laboratory and good clinical practices. We also depend upon third party manufacturers for the production of any products we may successfully develop to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices of the FDA, which are similarly outside our direct control. If third party laboratories and medical institutions conducting studies of our products fail to maintain both good laboratory and clinical practices, the studies could be delayed or have to be repeated. Similarly, if the manufacturers of any products we develop in the future fail to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices of the FDA, we may be forced to cease manufacturing such product until we have found another third party to manufacture the product.\nWe face risks associated with product liability lawsuits that could be brought against us.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human therapeutic products entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. We currently have a limited amount of product liability insurance, which may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us in the event that the use or misuse of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. In the event we are forced to expend significant funds on defending product liability actions, and in the event those funds come from operating capital, we will be required to reduce our business activities, which could lead to significant losses. Adequate insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. If available, we may not be able to maintain any such insurance at sufficient levels of coverage and any such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Whether or not a product liability insurance policy is obtained or maintained in the future, any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim.\nWe may be unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights.\nOur future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to:\n\u00b7 obtain and keep patent protection for our products and technologies on an international basis;\n\u00b7 enforce our patents to prevent others from using our inventions;\n\u00b7 maintain and prevent others from using our trade secrets; and\n\u00b7 operate and commercialize products without infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others.\nWe cannot assure you that our patent rights will afford any competitive advantages, and these rights may be challenged or circumvented by third parties. Further, patents may not be issued on any of our pending patent applications in the U.S. or abroad. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before a potential product can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, reducing or eliminating any advantage of the patent. If we sue others for infringing our patents, a court may determine that such patents are invalid or unenforceable. Even if the validity of our patent rights is upheld by a court, a court may not prevent the alleged infringement of our patent rights on the grounds that such activity is not covered by our patent claims.\nIn addition, third parties may sue us for infringing their patents. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to:\n\u00b7 pay substantial damages;\n\u00b7 stop using our technologies and methods;\n\u00b7 stop certain research and development efforts;\n\u00b7 develop non-infringing products or methods; and\n\u00b7 obtain one or more licenses from third parties.\nIf required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are sued for infringement, we could encounter substantial delays in development, manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates. Any litigation, whether to enforce our patent rights or to defend against allegations that we infringe third party rights, will be costly, time consuming, and may distract management from other important tasks.\nWe also rely in our business on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors and others. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that those agreements will provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information and prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure. To the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed products, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nWe face intense competition.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We face, and will continue to face, competition from numerous companies that currently market, or are developing, products for the treatment of the diseases and disorders we have targeted. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we have. We also compete with universities and other research institutions in the development of products, technologies and processes, as well as the recruitment of highly qualified personnel. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than the ones we have under development or that render our proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we will.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our financial returns.\nBraeburn\u2019s ability to commercialize Probuphine in the Territory and our ability or the ability of any future collaborators to commercialize Probuphine outside the Territory or to commercialize any other products we may successfully develop will depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. These third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new drug products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our own or our collaborator\u2019s drug products to enable us or them to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their and our investments in research and product development.\nHealth care reform measures and changes in policies, funding, staffing and leadership at the FDA and other agencies could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future results of operations and the future results of operations of our potential customers. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established a new Part D prescription drug benefit, which became effective January 1, 2006. Under the prescription drug benefit, Medicare beneficiaries can obtain prescription drug coverage from private sector plans that are permitted to limit the number of prescription drugs that are covered in each therapeutic category and class on their formularies. If our products are not widely included on the formularies of these plans, our ability to market our products may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (jointly, the \u201cPPACA\u201d), which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the \u201cATRA\u201d), which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nAdditionally, individual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally-mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This can reduce demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAdditionally, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for prescription drugs, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would permit more widespread importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States, including from countries where the products are sold at lower prices than in the United States. Such legislation, or similar regulatory changes, could lead to a decision to decrease our prices to better compete, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nWe may not be able to retain our key management and scientific personnel, and a loss of certain key personnel could significantly hinder our ability to move forward with our business plan.\nAs a company with a limited number of personnel, we are highly dependent on the services of our executive management and scientific staff, in particular Sunil Bhonsle and Marc Rubin, our President and Executive Chairman, respectively, and Katherine Glassman-Beebe our Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer. The loss of one or more of such individuals could substantially impair ongoing research and development programs and could hinder our ability to obtain corporate partners. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We compete in our hiring efforts with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations, and we may not be successful in our efforts to attract and retain personnel.\nOur net operating losses and research and development tax credits may not be available to reduce future federal and state income tax payments.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $232.5 million and $8.3 million, respectively, and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $154.7 million and $8.1 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income, if any. Current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credits in the event of an ownership change and we cannot assure you that our net operating loss and tax carryforwards will continue to be available.\nWe have a limited number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance and will need to seek stockholder approval to amend our charter to either effect an increase in our authorized shares of common stock or a reverse split.\nAt March 24, 2015, we had 14,672,293 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock, substantially all of which were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, and did not have a sufficient number of authorized shares to permit exercise of the Class A Warrants and Underwriter Warrants we issued in connection with our October 2014 public offering. Furthermore, we will need to continue to seek additional financing in order to fund our product development programs until such time, if ever, as the Probuphine NDA is approved by the FDA and royalty and milestone payments are sufficient to fund our operations. We have agreed to seek stockholder approval of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect either an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock or a reverse split, in either case in an amount sufficient to permit the exercise in full of the Class A Warrants. An increase in the authorized number of shares of common stock and the subsequent issuance of such shares could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by our stockholders. Shares of authorized and unissued common stock could, within the limits imposed by applicable law, be issued in one or more transactions which would make a change in control of our company more difficult, and therefore less likely. Furthermore, there are risks associated with effecting a reverse split, including a decline in the market price of our common stock and the possibility of certain shareholders owning \u201codd lots\u201d of less than 100 shares, which may be more difficult to sell, or require greater transaction costs per share to sell, than shares in \u201cround lots\u201d of even multiples of 100 shares. In addition, because holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any unissued stock of our company, the availability of a greater number of authorized shares, whether as a result of a reverse split or an increase in the authorized number, could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders and investors.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has experienced substantial fluctuations and could continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or prospects;\n\u00b7 sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u00b7 announcements about us or about our competitors, including introductions of new products;\n\u00b7 litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u00b7 governmental regulation and legislation; and\n\u00b7 change in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations.\nOur common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange and we may not be able to obtain an uplisting to a national exchange in the foreseeable future, if ever.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the OTCBB. Trading on the OTC Market is characterized by wide fluctuations in bid and asked prices and periods of inactive or limited trading. We expect to commence efforts to seek an uplisting to the Nasdaq Stock Market or another national securities exchange, however, we do not know whether we will be able to meet the initial listing criteria to enable us to obtain an uplisting of our common stock in the foreseeable future, if ever.\nOur common stock is deemed to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability requirements.\nOur common stock is subject to Rule 15g-1 through 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which imposes certain sales practice requirements on broker-dealers which sell our common stock to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 together with their spouses)). For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. This rule adversely affects the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock.\nAdditionally, our common stock is subject to the SEC regulations for \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Penny stock includes any equity security that is not listed on a national exchange and has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The regulations require that prior to any non-exempt buy/sell transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule set forth by the SEC relating to the penny stock market must be delivered to the purchaser of such penny stock. This disclosure must include the amount of commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current price quotations for the common stock. The regulations also require that monthly statements be sent to holders of penny stock that disclose recent price information for the penny stock and information of the limited market for penny stocks. These requirements adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other\n\u00b7 change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years, has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 82848, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "TTNP"}
