{"cik": "1109354", "company": "BRUKER CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be considered in conjunction with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. In addition to those risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report, we identify the following risk factors, which could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 will be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf Unfavorable economic or political conditions in the countries in which we operate may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition;\n\u25cf We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales and are subject to the operational risks of doing business in foreign countries;\n\u25cf If our products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance across their broad intended range of applications, we will not generate expected revenue;\n\u25cf Our products compete in markets that are subject to rapid technological change, and one or more of the technologies underlying our products could be made obsolete by new technology;\n\u25cf If investment in life and material science research spending declines, our ability to generate revenue may suffer;\n\u25cf Any reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales and impede our ability to generate revenue;\n\u25cf Disruptions at any of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business;\n\u25cf In addition to the risks applicable to our life science and materials analysis products, our CBRNE detection products are subject to a number of additional risks, including lengthy product development and contract negotiation periods and certain risks inherent in long-term government contracts;\n\u25cf Our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities;\n\u25cf If we lose our strategic partners, our marketing and sales efforts could be impaired;\n\u25cf We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business;\n\u25cf Our operations are dependent upon a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers;\n\u25cf Supply shortages and increasing prices of raw materials could adversely affect the gross profit of the Bruker BioSpin Group and the BEST Segment;\n\u25cf If we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property, third parties may use our technology, which would impair our ability to compete in our markets;\n\u25cf We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that are brought by us which could be expensive and time consuming and, if determined adversely, could adversely affect our patent position;\n\u25cf Our manufacture and sale of products could lead to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability;\n\u25cf Responding to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials which we use could be time consuming and costly; and\n\u25cf We operate as an entrepreneurial, decentralized company, which presents both benefits and certain risks. In particular, significant growth in a decentralized operating model may put strain on certain business group resources and our corporate functions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 may continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing novel coronavirus disease- 2019, or COVID-19, pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, now referred to as COVID-19, surfaced in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The virus has spread globally. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. Impacts to our business include temporary closures of many of our government and university customers and our suppliers, disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 ability to travel, and delays in product installations or shipments to and from affected countries.\nIn an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of countries, including the United States, have implemented and continue to implement significant restrictions on travel, shelter in place or stay at home orders, business closures and occupancy limitations. Certain jurisdictions, including many within the United States, have also begun implementing policies with the goal of re-opening these markets only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases or new strains of the virus. For example, a number of states, including California, Massachusetts and New Jersey where we have significant operations, issued shelter in place or stay-at-home orders during the first half of 2020. Although these states have begun implementing phased re-opening policies, many of our employees in these areas continue to work remotely and any re-openings may be delayed or pulled back if the virus continues to spread or if cases increase as a result of children returning to school. We have experienced decreased work efficiency and productivity as a result of the increased number of our employees working from home. In addition, with this remote working model where employees are increasingly accessing our systems through VPN or remote internet connections, we may be subject to increased security risks, including the risks of cyberattacks or data breaches. Additionally, if any of our key leaders contract the virus and are unable to perform their duties for a period of time as the result of illness, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in 2020, a number of our production facilities had to either temporarily close or operate on a reduced capacity. Most commercial activities in sales and marketing, and customer demonstrations and\napplications training, are either being conducted remotely or postponed. Customer purchasing departments are operating at reduced capacity, and many customers have delayed or cut capital expenditures and operating budgets. Even where customers have re-opened their sites, they may not be operating at pre-pandemic productivity levels in an effort to accommodate safety protocols. Any resurgence of the virus or the emergence of new strains of the virus may require us and our customers to close or partially close operations once again. These travel restrictions, business closures and operating reductions at Bruker, our customers, our distributors, and/or our suppliers have adversely impacted and will likely continue to adversely impact our operations worldwide, including our ability to manufacture, sell or distribute our products, as well as cause temporary closures of our foreign distributors, or the facilities of suppliers or customers. These disruptions of our employees, distributors, suppliers or customers have impacted and will likely continue to impact our global sales and operating results. During 2020, our revenue declined 4.1% compared to 2019, primarily due to COVID-19 related disruptions.\nWe continue to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercial operations, including its continued impact on our revenue and operations in 2021 and beyond. However, we cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will ultimately have on our operations due to continued uncertainties relating to the length or the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and the length or severity of the travel restrictions, business closures, and other safety and precautionary measures imposed by the governments of impacted countries or the effectiveness of any COVID-19 vaccines.\nUnfavorable economic or political conditions in the countries in which we operate may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.\nOur businesses and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic and political conditions. Our businesses or financial results may be adversely impacted by unfavorable changes in economic or political conditions in the countries and markets in which we operate, including, among others, adverse changes in interest rates or tax rates, volatility in financial and commodity markets, contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace, and changes in capital spending patterns.\nOur revenue from U.S. operations represented approximately 23% and 26% of total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue from operations in Europe represented approximately 38% and 35% of total consolidated revenue for the fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue from operations in the Asia Pacific region represented approximately 32% and 31% of total consolidated revenue in each of the corresponding periods. Economic factors that could adversely influence demand for our products include continued uncertainty about global economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, leading to ongoing reductions in investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 access to credit and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, academic or industrial spending behavior. Slower economic growth or a deterioration in economic conditions could result in a decrease in government funding for scientific research, a delay in orders from current or potential customers or a reduction in purchases of our products.\nWe cannot predict how changes in economic conditions or political instability will affect our customers and suppliers or how any negative impact on our customers and suppliers might adversely impact our business results or financial condition.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales and are subject to the operational risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nInternational sales account, and are expected to continue to account, for a significant portion of our total revenues. Our revenue from non-U.S. operations represented approximately 77% and 74% of our total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally, many of which are beyond\nour control. These risks, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and our ability to sell our products internationally, include:\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency translation rates;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf legislation and regulation, including tariffs, relating to the import or export of high technology products;\n\u25cf the imposition of government controls;\n\u25cf political and economic instability, including the impact of COVID-19, the possibility of an economic recession in certain key markets such as Germany, international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental restrictions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances;\n\u25cf costs and risks of deploying systems in foreign countries;\n\u25cf compliance with export laws and controls and trade embargoes in multiple jurisdictions;\n\u25cf limited intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties, including unfavorable labor regulations, specifically those applicable to our European operations; and\n\u25cf compliance with U.S. and local laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and local anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States has implemented tariffs on certain imported goods. These additional tariffs could include items imported by us from China or other countries. In addition, China has imposed tariffs on a wide range of American products in retaliation for these new American tariffs. As a result, there is a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States, could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by China and other countries as well. Any resulting trade war could negatively impact the global market for scientific instruments and could have a significant adverse effect on our business. The imposition of tariffs on items imported by us from China or other countries could increase our costs and could result in lowering our gross margin on products sold. Conversely, China imposing tariffs on items that we export to China, could adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability to purchase our products and our competitive position in China or increase our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe must also comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other similar regulations in other countries. The goal of the regulation is to increase individual rights and protections for personal data located in or originating from the European Union. GDPR is extraterritorial in that it applies to all business within the European Union and any business located outside of the European Union that processes personal data of individuals located within the European Union. There are significant fines associated with non-compliance. In 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, removed a key mechanism for transfers of personal data from the European Union to the United States and altered the international data transfer under GDPR. The decision has caused uncertainty for multinational companies about how they can properly transfer personal data from the EU to the US and the cost and effort to comply with such decision could cause disruption of data transfers and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWe previously had identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which has now been remediated. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could cause the trading price of our securities to decline.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the end of that fiscal year.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we remediated the previously disclosed material weakness in our internal controls over the accounting for income taxes and revenue recognition. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\nWe may lose money when we exchange foreign currency received from international sales into U.S. Dollars.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, which is our reporting currency. As a result, currency fluctuations among the U.S. Dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused, and will continue to cause, foreign currency translation gains and losses. In addition, currency fluctuations could cause the price of our products to be more or less competitive than our principal competitors\u2019 products. Currency fluctuations will increase or decrease our cost structure relative to those of our competitors, which could lessen the demand for our products and affect our competitive position. From time to time we enter into certain hedging transactions and/or option and foreign currency exchange contracts which are intended to offset some of the market risk associated with our sales denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot predict the effectiveness of these transactions or their impact upon our future operating results, and from time to time they may negatively affect our quarterly earnings.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition to the foreign currency exposure associated with differences between where our products are manufactured and sold by us and our competitors, our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results from the currency translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as from the exposure associated with transactions of our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary\u2019s functional currency. While our financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency. During consolidation, these results are translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our reported results. Moreover, as exchange rates vary, revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations. The effects of changes in currency exchange rates increased our 2020 revenue by approximately $29.4 million, or 1.4%, decreased our 2019 revenue by approximately $50.3 million, or 2.7%, and increased our 2018 revenue by approximately $25.5 million, or 1.4%. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded net gains from currency translation adjustments of $22.0 million and net losses of $20.0 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, to the extent monetary assets and liabilities, including cash and debt, are held in a different currency than the reporting subsidiary\u2019s functional currency, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our reported financial results, and may lead to increased earnings volatility. We may record significant gains or losses related to both the translation of assets and liabilities held by our subsidiaries into local currencies and the remeasurement of inter-company receivables and loan balances.\nGoodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets are subject to impairment which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe have recorded goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets that must be periodically evaluated for potential impairment. We assess the realizability of the reported goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets annually, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in the earnings associated with the reporting unit these assets are reported within. A decline in our stock price and market capitalization may also cause us to consider whether goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets may require an impairment assessment. Our ability to realize the value of these assets will depend on the future cash flows of the reporting unit in addition to how well we integrate the businesses we acquire. We did not record any impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have recorded impairment losses of $1.7 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIf our products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance across their broad intended range of applications, we will not generate expected revenue.\nOur business strategy depends on our ability to successfully commercialize a broad range of products based on our technology platforms, including magnetic resonance technology, pre-clinical imaging technology, mass spectrometry technology, X-ray technology, atomic force microscopy technology, stylus and optical metrology technology, fluorescence microscopy technology, infrared technology and superconducting magnet technologies for use in a variety of life science, chemistry and materials analysis applications. Some of our products have only recently been commercially launched and have achieved only limited sales to date. The commercial success of our products depends on obtaining and expanding market acceptance by a diverse array of industrial, academic, clinical, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, applied, medical research and governmental customers around the world. We may fail to achieve or sustain substantial market acceptance for our products across the full range of our intended applications or in one or more of our principal intended applications. Any such failure could decrease our sales and revenue. To succeed, we must convince substantial numbers of potential customers to invest in new systems or replace their existing techniques with techniques employing our systems. Limited funding available for capital acquisitions by our customers, as well as our customers\u2019 own internal purchasing approval policies, could hinder market acceptance of our products. Our intended customers may be reluctant to make the substantial capital investment generally needed to acquire our products or to incur the training and other costs involved with replacing their existing systems with our products. We also may not be able to convince our intended customers that our systems are an attractive and cost-effective alternative to other technologies and systems for the acquisition, analysis and management of molecular, cellular and microscopic information. Because of these and other factors, our products may fail to gain or sustain market acceptance.\nOur products compete in markets that are subject to rapid technological change, and one or more of the technologies underlying our products could be made obsolete by new technology.\nThe market for discovery and analysis tools is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions. Rapidly changing technology could make some or all of our product lines obsolete unless we are able to continually improve our existing products and develop new products. Because substantially all of our products are based on our technology platforms, including magnetic resonance technology, mass spectrometry technology, X-ray technology, atomic force microscopy technology, fluorescence microscopy technology, stylus and optical metrology technology and infrared technology, we are particularly vulnerable to any technological advances that would make these techniques obsolete as the basis for analytical systems in any\nof our markets. To meet the evolving needs of our customers, we must rapidly and continually enhance our current and planned products and services and develop and introduce new products and services. In addition, our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to rapid change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace. We may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the rapid changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve. If we fail to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology, market demands or the requirements of our customers, our product sales may decline, and we could experience significant losses.\nWe face substantial competition. If we fail to compete effectively, it could harm our business results and materially impact the value of our company.\nWe face substantial competition in our industries and we expect that competition in all of our markets will increase further. Currently, our principal competition comes from established companies providing products using existing technologies that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products. A number of our competitors have expanded their market share in recent years through business combinations. Other companies also may choose to enter our fields in the future. Our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products or that may render our products obsolete. Competition has in the past subjected, and is likely in the future to subject, our products to pricing pressure. Many of our competitors have more experience in the market and substantially greater financial, operational, marketing and technical resources than we do, which could give them a competitive advantage in areas such as research and development, production, marketing and distribution. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner and are technologically superior to, less expensive than, or more cost-effective than, other currently marketed products.\nIf investment in life and material science research spending declines, our ability to generate revenue may suffer.\nWe are dependent, both directly and indirectly, upon general investment in life science research, particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and in material science research as well as upon the financial condition and funding priorities of various governments and government agencies. Since our inception, both we and our academic collaborators and customers have benefited from various governmental contracts and research grants. Whether we or our academic collaborators will continue to be able to attract these grants depends not only on the quality of our products, but also on general spending patterns of public institutions.\nAny reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales and impede our ability to generate revenue.\nA significant portion of our sales are capital purchases by our customers. The spending policies of our customers could have a significant effect on the demand for our products. These policies are based on a wide variety of factors, including the resources available to make purchases, the spending priorities among various types of equipment, policies regarding spending during recessionary periods and changes in the political climate.\nAny changes in capital spending or changes in the capital budgets of our customers could significantly reduce demand for our products. The capital resources of our life science and other corporate customers may be limited by the availability of equity or debt financing. Any significant decline in research and development expenditures by our life science and material science customers could significantly decrease our sales. In addition, a substantial portion of our sales are to non-profit and government entities, which are dependent on government support for scientific research. Any decline in this support could decrease the ability of these customers to purchase our products.\nDisruptions at any of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business.\nWe have manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe, Israel and Malaysia. Many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. If we experience any significant disruption of those facilities for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events beyond our control, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing could harm our customer relationships, impede our ability to generate revenues from our backlog or obtain new orders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our employees are represented by workers\u2019 councils and labor unions in certain jurisdictions, primarily in Germany and France. If disputes with these employees arise, or if our workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition to the risks applicable to our life science and materials analysis products, our CBRNE detection products are subject to a number of additional risks, including lengthy product development and contract negotiation periods and certain risks inherent in long-term government contracts.\nOur CBRNE detection products are subject to many of the same risks associated with our life science products, including vulnerability to rapid technological change, dependence on mass spectrometry and other technologies and substantial competition. In addition, our CBRNE detection products and certain FT-IR products are generally sold to government agencies under long-term contracts. These contracts generally involve lengthy pre-contract negotiations and product development. We may be required to devote substantial working capital and other resources prior to obtaining product orders. As a result, we may incur substantial costs before we recognize revenue from these products. Moreover, in return for larger, longer-term contracts, our customers for these products often demand more stringent acceptance criteria. These criteria may also cause delays in our ability to recognize revenue from sales of these products. Furthermore, we may not be able to accurately predict in advance our costs to fulfill our obligations under these long-term contracts. If we fail to accurately predict our costs, due to inflation or other factors, we could incur significant losses. Also, the presence or absence of such contracts may cause substantial variation in our results of operations between fiscal periods and, as a result, our results of operations for any given fiscal period may not be predictive of our results for subsequent fiscal periods. The resulting uncertainty may have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nWe rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A security failure of that technology, including with respect to cybersecurity, could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our financial results, damage our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.\nWe use information systems to carry out our operations and maintain our business records. Some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. Our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised, damaged or fail. This could be a result of a cyber-incident, social engineering scam, hacking, phishing attempts, malware, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, other proprietary information and personally identifiable information. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. If this data is compromised, destroyed or inappropriately disclosed, it could have a material adverse effect, including damage to our reputation, loss of customers, significant expenses to address and resolve the issues, fines or litigation or other proceedings by affected individuals, business partners or regulatory authorities.\nOur debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of debt totaling approximately $846.9 million. We also had the ability to borrow an additional $599.9 million available under our existing credit facility. Most of our outstanding debt is in the United States and there are substantial cash requirements in the United States to service debt interest obligations, fund operations, capital expenditures and our declared dividends and finance potential acquisitions or share repurchases. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations and meet our other liquidity needs depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations or provide sufficient funds for our other objectives. If we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures or suspend our dividend payments and share repurchases. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, a majority of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is generated from foreign operations, with $514.9 million, or 70.4% held by foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the United States to address our funding requirements through cash from operations and timely repatriation of cash from overseas or other sources obtained at an acceptable cost.\nAdditionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios related to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage and contain affirmative and negative covenants, including among others, timely provision of audited financial statements, restrictions on liens, indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, asset sales, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our operations and performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign currency translation rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under the facility and require us to prepay the debt before its scheduled due date.\nThe transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our cost to obtain financing.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, rates after 2021. As a result, LIBOR may be discontinued in 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started in May 2018 to publish the Secured Overnight Finance Rate, or SOFR, as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight U.S. treasury repo market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether the SOFR or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. The manner and impact of this transition may materially adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, which may result in an increase in borrowing costs under our credit agreements and term loan agreement. Any replacement for LIBOR may result in an effective increase in the applicable interest rate on our current or future debt obligations, including our credit agreements and term loan agreement.\nChanges in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include interpretations of existing tax laws, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax assets and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow from operations. In addition to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 in the United States, there are currently multiple initiatives for comprehensive tax reform underway in other key jurisdictions where we have operations. We assess the impact of various international tax reform proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties in all jurisdictions where we have operations that could result in a material impact on our income taxes. We cannot predict whether any other specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing treaties, the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious international tax risks could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to international tax risks. We could be subject to double taxation on income related to operations in certain countries that do not have tax treaties with the country of the trading partner. In addition, we may have a higher effective income tax rate than that of other companies in our industry if losses incurred by one operating company are not available to offset the income of an operating company located in another country. Also, distributions of earnings and other payments received from our subsidiaries may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the countries where they are operating or are incorporated. If these foreign countries do not have income tax treaties with the United States or the countries where our subsidiaries are incorporated, we could be subject to high rates of withholding taxes on these distributions and payments. Additionally, the amount of the credit that we may claim against our U.S. federal income tax for foreign income taxes paid or accrued is subject to many limitations which may significantly restrict our ability to claim a credit for all of the foreign taxes we pay.\nWe currently have reserves established for potential tax liabilities. If these reserves are challenged, and we are unable to successfully defend our tax positions, a negative impact to our cash flows could result.\nThe unpredictability and fluctuation of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenues and results of operations have in the past and will in the future vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. The primary factors that may affect us include the following:\n\u25cf the timing of sales of our products and services;\n\u25cf the timing of recognizing revenue and deferred revenue under U.S. GAAP;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf increases in sales and marketing, product development or administration expenses;\n\u25cf the mix of services provided by us and third-party contractors;\n\u25cf our ability to attain and maintain quality levels for our products;\n\u25cf costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses; and\nWe can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside our control, such as:\n\u25cf the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets;\n\u25cf the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf the time it takes for us to receive critical materials to manufacture our products;\n\u25cf general economic conditions;\n\u25cf the time it takes to satisfy local customs requirements and other export/import requirements;\n\u25cf the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; and\n\u25cf the time required to obtain governmental licenses.\nThese factors have in the past affected the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter\u2019s operating performance.\nHistorically we have higher levels of revenue in the fourth quarter of the year compared to the first, second and third quarters, which we believe is primarily the result of our customers\u2019 budgeting cycles. Quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters, our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this event, the price of our common stock may fall.\nThe ownership of our shares is highly concentrated, which could cause or exacerbate volatility in our share price as well as have significant influence over us.\nAs of February 18, 2021, Laukien family members, including our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Frank Laukien and his brother, Joerg Laukien, owned, in the aggregate, approximately 31% of our outstanding common stock. We may also repurchase shares in the future, which could further increase the concentration of our share ownership. Because of this reduced liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders could disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously if a large number of our shares were sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a company with greater trading liquidity that could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price. These stockholders may also exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and will make some transactions difficult to accomplish without the support of these stockholders.\nThe loss of key personnel or an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our CEO and other members of senior management and key finance, technical, scientific and production personnel, any of whom may cease their employment with us at any time with minimal advance notice. Because the expertise of these individuals is highly specific and takes years to develop, we face intense competition for these individuals from many other companies. The loss of one or more of our key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, and our failure to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals or to adequately plan for succession could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan.\nDividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.\nIn recent years, we have paid dividends on our common stock. In February 2021, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share that will be payable in March 2021. There is no guarantee that such dividends will continue indefinitely. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we lose our strategic partners, our marketing and sales efforts could be impaired.\nA substantial portion of our sales of selected products consists of sales to third parties who incorporate our products into their systems. These third parties are responsible for the marketing and sales of their systems. We have little or no control over their marketing and sales activities or how they use their resources. Our present or future strategic partners may or may not purchase sufficient quantities of products from us or perform appropriate marketing and sales activities. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our relationships with strategic partners, our businesses may suffer. Failures by our present or future strategic partners, or our inability to maintain existing or enter into new arrangements with strategic partners for product distribution, could materially impede the growth of our businesses and our ability to generate sufficient revenue and profits.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.\nWe sell some products through third party agents, including distributors and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks, including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes, credit risks, and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings. Distributors may also face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable. Risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position. Moreover, violations of the FCPA or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party agents could materially and adversely impact our business, reputation and results of operations.\nDependence on contract manufacturing may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation.\nAs part of our efforts to streamline our operations and reduce our operating costs, we outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing processes and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers could cause disruptions or delays. Problems with outsourced manufacturing could result in lower revenues and unexecuted efficiencies, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers.\nWe currently purchase components used in our products from a limited number of outside suppliers. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could result in time delays associated with redesigning a product due to an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. Any of these factors could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In particular, our X-ray microanalysis business, which manufactures and sells accessories for electron microscopes, is partially dependent on cooperation from larger manufacturers of electron microscopes. Additionally, our elemental analysis business purchases certain optical detectors from a single supplier, PerkinElmer, Inc., the sole supplier of these detector components. Bruker CALID purchases detectors and power supplies from sole or limited source suppliers and its focal plane array detectors from a single supplier, Lockheed Martin Corporation. Similarly, Bruker BioSpin obtains various components from sole or limited source suppliers and BEST obtains various raw materials and uses key production equipment from sole or limited source suppliers or contract manufacturers. There are limited, if any, available alternatives to these suppliers. The existence of shortages of these components or the failure of delivery with regard to these components could have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and margins. In addition, price increases from these suppliers or contract manufacturers could have a material adverse effect upon our gross margins.\nBecause of the scarcity of some components, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of components, or we may be required to pay higher prices or to purchase components of lesser quality. Any delay or interruption in the supply of these or other components could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products, harm our reputation and cause a reduction in our revenues. In addition, any increase in the cost of the components that we use in our products could make our products less competitive and decrease our gross profits. We may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of required components on the same or substantially the same terms. Additionally, consolidation among our suppliers could result in other sole source suppliers for us in the future. Other events that could affect our ability to source materials, manufacture or distribute our products include fire, natural disaster or extreme weather or a pandemic and the impact of those events on our and our suppliers\u2019 and contract manufacturers\u2019 operations.\nSupply shortages and increasing prices of raw materials could adversely affect the gross profit of the Bruker BioSpin Group and the BEST Segment.\nThe last few years have seen periodic supply shortages and sharp increases in the prices for various raw materials, in part due to high demand from developing countries. Bruker BioSpin and BEST rely on some of these materials for the production of their products. In particular, for its superconducting magnet production, both for the horizontal and vertical magnet series, Bruker BioSpin relies on the availability of copper, steel and the metallic raw materials for traditional low-temperature superconducting wires. Similarly, BEST relies on the availability of niobium titanium for its production of low-temperature superconducting materials and devices. Higher prices for these commodities will increase the production cost of superconducting wires and superconducting magnets and may adversely affect gross profits.\nThe prices of copper and certain other raw materials used for superconductors have increased significantly over the last decade. Since copper is a main constituent of low temperature superconductors, this may affect the price of superconducting wire. This type of increase would have an immediate effect on the production costs of superconducting magnets and may negatively affect the profit margins for those products. In addition, an increase in raw material costs could affect the production cost of the superconducting wire produced by BEST and of superconducting wire used by Bruker BioSpin.\nBruker BioSpin and its customers also rely on liquid helium to operate superconducting magnets. Helium is controlled by the Federal Helium Reserve and is subject to price changes. Shortages of liquid helium associated with federal price controls or depleted natural reserves could have an adverse impact on producing and operating BioSpin\u2019s superconducting magnets and may also drive increases in helium pricing and negatively impact the profit margins of those products.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nOur success depends on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others.\nOur commercial success depends on avoiding the infringement of other parties\u2019 patents and proprietary rights as well as avoiding the breach of any licenses relating to our technologies and products. Given that there may be patents of which we are unaware, particularly in the United States where patent applications are confidential, avoidance of patent infringement may be difficult. Various third parties hold patents which may relate to our technology, and we may be found in the future to infringe these or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties, either with products we are currently marketing or developing or with new products which we may develop in the future. If a third-party holding rights under a patent successfully asserts an infringement claim with respect to any of our current or future products, we may be prevented from manufacturing or marketing our infringing product in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder. We may not be able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, especially if the patent holder is a competitor. In addition, even if we can obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, which will permit others to practice the same technology licensed to us. We also may be required to pay substantial damages to the patent holder in the event of infringement. Under some circumstances in the United States these damages could include damages equal to triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing by them or licensed third parties to manufacture, use or market infringing products, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses the third parties may sustain themselves as the result of lost sales or license payments they are required to make to the patent holder. Any successful infringement action brought against us may also adversely affect marketing of the infringing product in other markets not covered by the infringement action, as well as our marketing of other products based on similar technology. Furthermore, we will suffer adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal, nullified through another action or resolved by settlement with the patent holder. The damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may be significant. As a result, any successful infringement action against us may harm our business.\nIf we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property, third parties may use our technology, which would impair our ability to compete in our markets.\nOur continued success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products throughout the world. We rely on patents to protect a significant part of our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position. However, our presently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents, and any patent previously issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. Furthermore, the claims in patents which have been issued, or which may be issued to us in the future, may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar to our products. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology could materially impair our ability to be commercially competitive.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on the protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners upon the commencement of a relationship with us. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information. In addition, adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information. The loss or exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. Furthermore, others may have, or may in the future independently develop, substantially similar or superior know-how and technology.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that are brought by us which could be expensive and time consuming and, if determined adversely, could adversely affect our patent position.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties, and we may be similarly sued by others. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions. The defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings is costly and diverts our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOn September 25, 2019, in a complaint filed in the D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, District Court, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG (Zeiss), sued Luxendo GmbH (Luxendo), a subsidiary of Bruker Corporation, for infringement of a recently registered German utility model patent licensed to Zeiss pertaining to one specific Luxendo product category. We are vigorously defending against these claims.\nOn September 23, 2019, in a complaint filed in the D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, District Court, Micromass UK Limited, a subsidiary of Waters Corporation, sued Bruker Corporation, as well as its affiliate, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, for infringement of a European patent pertaining to our timsTOF product line. On February 17, 2020, Micromass expanded its complaint in D\u00fcsseldorf to assert another recently granted European patent in Germany. We are vigorously defending against these claims and we do not expect any material losses associated with this matter in excess of amounts already accrued.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance\nOur manufacture and sale of products could lead to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products expose us to product liability claims if any of our products cause injury or are found otherwise unsuitable during manufacturing, marketing, sale or customer use. In particular, if one of our CBRNE detection products malfunctions, this could lead to civilian or military casualties in a time of unrest, exposing us to increased potential for high-profile liability. If our CBRNE detection products malfunction by generating a false-positive to a potential threat, we could be exposed to liabilities associated with actions taken that otherwise would not have been required. Additionally, the nuclear magnetic resonance, research magnetic resonance imaging, Fourier transform mass spectrometry and certain electron paramagnetic resonance magnets of Bruker BioSpin utilize high magnet fields and cryogenics to operate at approximately 4 Kelvin, the temperature of liquid helium. There is an inherent risk of potential product liability due to the existence of these high magnetic fields, associated stray fields outside the magnet, and the handling of the cryogens associated with superconducting magnets. In addition, our MALDI Biotyper product has an IVD-CE mark and U.S. FDA approval and is used for the identification of microorganisms. Misidentification or a false-negative of certain viruses, bacteria, yeasts or fungi could lead to inappropriate treatment for patients and could expose us to product liability claims.\nA successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of, or outside the coverage of, our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nResponding to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials which we use could be time consuming and costly.\nWe use controlled hazardous and radioactive materials in our business and generate wastes that are regulated as hazardous wastes under U.S. federal, and Massachusetts, California, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin state environmental and atomic energy regulatory laws and under equivalent provisions of law in those and other jurisdictions in which our research and manufacturing facilities are located. Our use of these substances and materials is subject to stringent, and periodically changing, regulation that can impose costly compliance obligations on us and has the potential to adversely affect our manufacturing activities. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. If an accident with these substances occurs, we could be held liable for any damages that result, in addition to incurring clean-up costs and liabilities, which can be substantial. Additionally, an accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities resulting in delays and increased costs.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may impose significant compliance or other costs on us.\nOur manufacturing, product development and research and development operations and processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. In addition, we own and/or lease a number of facilities, some of which have been in operation for many decades, where we or others may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are considered hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. We also have acquired various companies which historically may have used certain hazardous materials and which may have owned and/or leased facilities at which hazardous materials have been used. For all of these reasons, we are subject to federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, transportation, handling, treatment, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and certain waste products. We have potential liability under these laws and regulations with respect to the remediation of past contamination in certain of the facilities we now own or lease. Additionally, in the future our facilities and the disposal sites owned by others to which we send or sent waste, may be identified as contaminated and require remediation. Accordingly, we may become subject to additional compliance costs or environmental liabilities which may be significant and could materially harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to existing and potential additional regulation and government inquiry, which can impose burdens on our operations and narrow the markets for our products.\nWe are subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of existing and potential future government regulation of our operations and markets. For example, the exportation of our products is subject to U.S. and non-U.S. export control, sanctions, customs, import and anti-boycott laws and regulations, including, as applicable, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and the sanctions laws, regulations and executive orders administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and other laws and regulations adopted by the governments or agencies of other countries relating to the same subject matter as the U.S. laws and regulations described above.\nThe failure to satisfy export control criteria or obtain necessary clearances could delay or prevent shipment of products, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who are also exposed to similar risks. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our brand, international growth efforts and business.\nIn addition, as a result of our international operations, we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the FCPA and local anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business (including some higher risk countries according to the Transparency International Corruption Index), which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries or agents from engaging in bribery or making improper payments to foreign officials or their agents. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the SEC. Despite maintaining policies and procedures that require our employees to comply with these laws and our standards of ethical conduct, we cannot ensure that these policies and procedures will always protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees or third-party agents.\nMoreover, the life sciences industry, which is the market for our principal products, has historically been heavily regulated. Given the evolving nature of this industry, legislative bodies or regulatory authorities may adopt additional regulation that adversely affects our market opportunities. Our business is also directly affected by a wide variety of government regulations applicable to business enterprises generally and to companies operating in the life sciences industry in particular.\nOur products are subject to the FDA\u2019s requirements for electronic radiation emitting products, which include requirements related to record-keeping and reporting; labeling; notification; product repairs, replacements, and refunds; importation; and performance standards. In addition, our clinical products are subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA in the United States and by similar regulatory bodies in other countries where such products are sold. These regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities, from quality management, design, development, and testing to labeling, manufacturing, complaint handling, reporting, promotion, sales and distribution. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which may result in written inspectional observations. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities also monitor product promotion and marketing materials and activities. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements, or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell such products. Any such FDA or comparable foreign regulatory actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, negative publicity and product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There are similar foreign regulations. For instance, the coming into force of the European Union Directive in May 2022 by the IVD Regulation (EU) 2017/746 imposes a stricter regime on manufacturers of IVDs and our products currently approved under the Directive must be recertified under the Regulation by May 2024.\nWe have been, are, and expect to be in the future, subject to inquiries from the government agencies that enforce these regulations, including the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. FDA, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Defense, among others, as well as from state or foreign governments and their departments and agencies. As a result, from time to time, the attention of our management and other resources may be diverted to attend to these inquiries. In addition, failure to comply with these regulations or obtain or maintain necessary permits and licenses could result in a variety of fines or other censures or an interruption in our business operations which may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate as an entrepreneurial, decentralized company, which presents both benefits and certain risks. In particular, significant growth in a decentralized operating model may put strain on certain business group resources and our corporate functions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\nDecentralization necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management, which presents certain risks, including the risk that we may be slower to detect or react to compliance-related matters and that \u201ccompany-wide\u201d business initiatives may be more challenging or costly to implement, and the risk of noncompliance or failures higher than they may be in a more centralized operating environment. In addition, key business group resources and our corporate functions, which are leanly staffed but responsible for supporting our decentralized operations, may also not be able to detect or resolve financial, operational, and compliance matters on a timely basis. Our failure to adapt our financial, operational and compliance controls and systems to effectively manage our decentralized business and comply with our obligations as a public company could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGeneral Risks Factors\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire through mergers, acquisitions or strategic alliances, we may not be able to realize all of the cost savings and other benefits that we expect to result from the transactions and our financial results may be different than expected.\nOur strategy includes expanding our technology base and product offerings through selected mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances. For example, from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, we have acquired 13 businesses to expand our technologies and product offerings.\nSuccessful integration of the businesses we acquire involves a number of risks, including, among others, risks related to:\n\u25cf coordinating or consolidating geographically separate organizations and integrating personnel with different business backgrounds and corporate cultures;\n\u25cf integrating previously autonomous departments in sales and marketing, distribution, accounting and administrative functions;\n\u25cf integrating financial information and management systems;\n\u25cf the pace of our acquisition activity and the related diversion of already limited resources and management time;\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u25cf potential impairment of relationships with customers as a result of changes in management or otherwise arising out of such transactions; and\n\u25cf retention of key employees of the acquired businesses within the first one to two years after the acquisition, including the risk that they may compete with us subsequently.\nWe may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or business in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. As a result, we may not realize the value from expected synergies. Acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result, in unexpected significant costs and expenses, including disputes over contingent consideration and complicated accounting for complex transaction structures. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets.\nWe generally assume the liabilities of businesses we acquire, which could include liability for an acquired business\u2019 violation of law that occurred before we acquired it. In addition, we have historically acquired smaller, privately held companies that may not have strong cultures of legal compliance or the robust financial controls of a larger, publicly traded company, and if we fail to implement adequate training, controls, and monitoring of the acquired companies, we could also be liable for post-acquisition legal or accounting violations.\nOther companies may have difficulty acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, due to provisions under our corporate charter and bylaws, as well as Delaware law.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our bylaws, as well as Delaware law could make it more difficult for other companies to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws contain the following provisions, among others, which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party:\n\u25cf a staggered Board of Directors, where stockholders elect only a minority of the board each year;\n\u25cf advance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf a limitation on who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote.", "PERMNO": 88504, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "BRKR"}
