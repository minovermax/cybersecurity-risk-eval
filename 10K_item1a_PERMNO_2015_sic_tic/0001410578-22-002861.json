{"cik": "874710", "company": "ALLIED HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-10-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in the Company\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) before making any investment decision with respect to the Company\u2019s securities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also affect the Company\u2019s business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations could change.\nCOVID-19 RISKS\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks of infections or diseases could substantially harm our business\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak and other possible pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of diseases or infections could have significant negative impacts on our business, expenses, revenues and profitability. These events can result in, and in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, have resulted in disruptions to our business, including without limitation those arising from the following factors:\n- Employee matters: The Company\u2019s ability to operate is contingent on maintaining healthy and safe work conditions. Incidents of COVID-19 in the Company\u2019s workforce could lead to delays in production. While the Company is taking steps to protect its employees and maintain safe work conditions, such efforts cannot guarantee that its employees will not be impacted, directly or indirectly, by COVID-19. In addition, partially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and general tightening of the labor market, the Company has had difficulty in obtaining the workers necessary to produce its products. Since the pandemic began, and continuing currently, the Company has experienced greater difficulty in hiring production employees. This has contributed to delays in the production and shipping of some products. Some orders have been cancelled as a result of the delays and this situation may negatively impact our ability to make future sales.\n- Supply chain issues and inflation: Partially as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and inflationary pressures following the reopening of global economies, there have been disruptions to the supply chain that may lead to delays in obtaining necessary raw materials and component inventory. The Company is working with existing and alternative suppliers to obtain the necessary components for its products, however, to date, the Company has not been able to sufficiently alleviate this situation to avoid delays in production.\nLEGAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to substantial domestic and international government regulation, including regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes. Failure by us to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe FDA regulates the approval, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of many of our products in the U.S. Significant government regulation also exists in Canada, Japan, and other countries in which we conduct business. As a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions, withdrawals, and/or declining sales.\nOur products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which would harm our reputation and our business.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which our products are sold, have the authority to request and, in some cases, require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects. Any recall of product would divert managerial and financial resources, may harm our reputation with our customers and could damage our business.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur success depends upon the development of new products and product enhancements, which entails considerable time and expense.\nTo effectively compete, we must be able to invest in the development of new products to add to our product portfolio and on the development of enhancements to our existing products. Product development involves substantial expense and we cannot be certain that a completed product will generate sufficient revenue for our business to justify the resources that we devote to research and development related to such product. The time and expense required to develop new products and product enhancements is difficult to predict and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in developing, introducing and marketing new products and product enhancements. Our operating losses and negative cash flow impede our ability to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to existing products. Our inability to successfully develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis or at all, or to achieve market acceptance of such products, could materially impair our business.\nWe are dependent on adequate protection of our patent and proprietary rights.\nWe rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors. We cannot assure you that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets. Our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and may make substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to manufacture or market our products. Further, while we do not believe that any of our products or processes interfere with the rights of others, third parties may nonetheless assert patent infringement claims against us in the future.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how we own, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claims of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent or delay us from manufacturing, selling, or using our products. The occurrence of such litigation or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of raw materials could increase our costs of producing our products.\nWe purchase raw materials, fabricated components and services from a variety of suppliers. Raw materials such as brass, plastics, and calcium hydroxide are considered key raw materials. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory and that alternative sources of supply are readily available. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to global market demands, which could impair the company\u2019s ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of such materials. Inflationary and other increases in costs of these raw materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time. In addition, freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas. Specifically, we are currently in a period of high inflation. While the Federal Reserve has commented that the rise in the cost of products is transitory, the Company cannot predict the path of future inflation. In fiscal year 2022, the Company believes that inflation raised the cost of its purchases by approximately $1.3 million. The Company anticipate that these cost increases will continue in fiscal year 2023, although it cannot predict the extent of such increases.\nWe are exposed to certain credit risks, resulting primarily from customer sales.\nSubstantially all of our receivables are due from homecare providers, distributors, hospitals, and contractors. Our customers are located throughout the U.S. and around the world. We record an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based primarily on our evaluation of the payment pattern, financial condition, cash flows, and credit history of our customers, as well as current industry and economic conditions. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and its market price may fluctuate widely.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market but is thinly traded. As a result, stockholders may not be able to sell shares of common stock on short notice. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variation in our operating results, announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors, and other events or factors. For example, a shortfall in net sales or net income, or an increase in losses could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many micro and small capitalization companies and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Additionally, management believes that since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic there has increased speculation in the Company\u2019s shares which has resulted in significant fluctuations in price. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities, we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline.\nWe have two manufacturing operations. In the event that one of these facilities were severely damaged or destroyed as a result of a natural or man-made disaster we would be forced to relocate production to other facilities and/or rely on third-party manufacturers. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key employees, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder the management of our business, our research and development, our sales and marketing efforts, and our manufacturing capabilities. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to hire or retain key employees. We compete to hire new employees from larger, better capitalized companies, and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The Company has not provided salary increases to its employees outside of the collective bargaining unit in several years. While the Company does not believe that this has had a material impact on its operations, the Company may be materially adversely impacted if it fails to compete with the compensation offerings of other employers.\nWe have a history of net losses in fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2022 and we may not be able to return to profitability in the future and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of net losses. We reported a net loss of $2.1 million in fiscal 2019, a net loss of $3.1 million in fiscal 2020 and a net loss of $5.4 million in the most recent fiscal year. In fiscal 2021 we had net income of $1.7 million including the benefit of the forgiveness of a $2.4 million PPP loan. We will need to generate and sustain increased sales levels in the future to become consistently profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to achieve consistent profitability. We may also incur losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease. If we continue to experience operating losses and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through other means, then our liquidity needs may exceed availability under our credit facility, and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our access to raw materials or services that are important to the operation of our business. Most recently, the Company has experienced significant challenges sourcing necessary parts and components both from vendors and the Company\u2019s internal production. As a result, the Company\u2019s backlog of orders has grown. To the extent that the Company cannot timely meet shipping deadlines for existing orders, this may impair the Company\u2019s ability to make future sales to impacted customers.\nWhile the Company received $6.8 million, net of the escrowed amounts for repairs to the building, as a result of the sale-leaseback of its St. Louis Property, as described in Part I, Item 2 below, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial statements have been presented assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company\u2019s rate of cash used in operating activities has accelerated and there is doubt as to whether the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to allow the Company to meet its needs for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.\nINDUSTRY & ECONOMIC RISKS\nWe participate in a highly competitive environment.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions. Our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations. We face intense competition from other manufacturers. Some of our competitors may be larger than we are and may have greater financial, technical, research, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. We believe that price competition will continue among products developed in our markets. Our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do. Such developments could have a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to compete successfully, we may not be able to do so in a profitable manner.\nOur business of manufacturing, marketing, and selling of medical devices involves the risk of liability claims and such claims could seriously harm our business, particularly if our insurance coverage is inadequate.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, production, marketing and sale of medical devices. Like other participants in the medical device market, we are from time to time involved in lawsuits, claims and proceedings alleging product liability and related claims such as negligence. If any current or future product liability claims become substantial, our reputation could be damaged significantly, thereby harming our business. We may be required to pay substantial damage awards as a result of any successful product liability claims. Any product liability claim against us, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, and divert the time, attention, and resources of our management.\nAs a result of our exposure to product liability claims, we currently carry product liability insurance covering our products with policy limits per occurrence and in the aggregate that we have deemed to be sufficient. Our insurance may not cover certain product liability claims or our liability for any claims may exceed our coverage limits. Therefore, we cannot predict whether this insurance is sufficient, or if not, whether we will be able to obtain sufficient insurance to cover the risks associated with our business or whether such insurance will be available at premiums that are commercially reasonable. In addition, these insurance policies must be renewed annually. Although we have been able to obtain liability insurance, such insurance may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim against us or settlement by us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, or our inability to maintain insurance in the future, or any claim that results in significant costs to or adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S. healthcare industry and third party payment structures may not be favorable to us.\nOver a number of years, the U.S. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to and affordability of medical care, improve safety and patient outcomes, contain costs and increase efficiencies. These changes have included general declines in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers, the basis for payments beginning to transition from a fee-for-service model to value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics, physician offices and patients\u2019 homes. Any or all of the measures could impact demand for our products.\nThe cost of a majority of medical care in the United States is funded by the U.S. Government through the Medicare and Medicaid programs and by private insurance programs, such as corporate health insurance plans. Although we do not receive payments for our products directly from these programs, home respiratory care providers and durable medical equipment suppliers, who are the primary customers for several of our products, depend heavily on payments from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers as a major source of revenues. In addition, sales of certain of our products are affected by the extent of hospital and health care facility construction and renovation at any given time. The federal government indirectly funds a significant percentage of such construction and renovation costs through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. In recent years, governmentally imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals and other health care providers have impacted spending for services, consumables and capital goods. A material decrease from current reimbursement levels or a material change in the method or basis of reimbursing health care providers is likely to adversely affect future sales of our products.\nWe expect the U.S. healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Possible changes include further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits. These possible changes, and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes, may adversely affect us.", "PERMNO": 77259, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "AHPI"}
