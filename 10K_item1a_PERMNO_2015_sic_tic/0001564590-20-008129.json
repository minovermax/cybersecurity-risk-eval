{"cik": "1142417", "company": "NEXSTAR MEDIA GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this document. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of those risks occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for further information.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nGeneral trends in the television industry could adversely affect demand for television advertising as consumers migrate to alternative media, including the Internet, for entertainment.\nTelevision viewing among consumers has been negatively impacted by the increasing availability of alternative media, including the Internet. In recent years, demand for television advertising has been declining and demand for advertising in alternative media has been increasing, and we expect this trend to continue.\nThe networks have begun streaming some of their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms simultaneously with, or in close proximity to, network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own or provide services to. These and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and may adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations. Also, refer to \u201cRisks Related to Our Industry - Intense competition in the television industry and alternative forms of media could limit our growth and profitability.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s substantial debt could limit its ability to grow and compete.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $8.5 billion of debt, net of unamortized financing costs, discounts and premium, which represented 80.7% of the total combined capitalization.\nThe Company\u2019s high level of debt could have important consequences to its business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nexpose the Company to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities is variable;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to withstand a general downturn in our business and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nSee Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations\u201d for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature.\nThe Company could also incur additional debt in the future. The terms of the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities, as well as the indentures governing its 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (\u201c5.625% Notes due 2024\u201d) and our 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (\u201c5.625% Notes due 2027\u201d), limit, but do not prohibit the Company from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt. To the extent the Company incurs additional debt, it would become even more susceptible to the leverage-related risks described above.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s debt contain various covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in the operation of its business.\nThe terms of the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing its 5.625% Notes due 2024 and 5.625% Notes due 2027 contain various restrictive covenants customary for arrangements of these types that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets or stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios, including a maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio. Future financing agreements may contain similar, or even more restrictive, provisions and covenants. Because of these restrictions and covenants, management\u2019s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited, and we may be unable to compete effectively, pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements, a default may occur. A default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. A default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt.\nThe credit agreement governing our obligations under our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that require us to comply with a maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00. The covenants, which are calculated on a quarterly basis, include the combined results of the Company. The credit agreements governing Mission\u2019s and Shield\u2019s obligations under their senior secured credit facilities do not contain financial covenant ratio requirements; however, they include events of default if we do not comply with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to service its debt depends on its ability to generate the necessary cash flow. Generation of the necessary cash flow is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot assure you that its business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to the Company under its current or any replacement credit facilities, or that it will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to fund its operations or pay its debts and other obligations, or to fund its liquidity needs. If the Company is not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations, it may need to refinance or restructure its debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to meet its debt service obligations, its lenders may determine to stop making loans to the Company, and/or the Company\u2019s lenders or other holders of its debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations under the respective agreements, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe owners of the VIEs may make decisions regarding the operation of their respective stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the VIEs are each 100% owned by independent third parties. These entities owned and operated 36 full power television stations, of which 32 stations were included in our financial statements as consolidated VIEs. We have entered into local service agreements with these VIEs, pursuant to which we provide services to their stations. In return for the services we provide, we receive substantially all of the VIEs\u2019 available cash, after satisfaction of their operating costs and any debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Mission\u2019s senior secured credit facility consists of a Term Loan B with an outstanding principal balance of $226.2 million due January 17, 2024 and a $3.0 million revolving credit facility, of which nothing was drawn and outstanding. Shield\u2019s senior secured credit facility consists of a Term Loan A with an outstanding principal balance of $21.8 million due October 26, 2023.\nWe guarantee full payment of all of the obligations incurred under the Mission and Shield senior secured credit facilities in the event of their default. All consolidated VIEs have granted purchase options that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of those VIEs\u2019 stations, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs.\nWe do not own the VIEs or any of their respective television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in the consolidated VIEs because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the VIEs\u2019 stations, (2) Nexstar\u2019s guarantees of the obligations incurred under the Mission and Shield senior secured credit facilities, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the VIEs\u2019 economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by each VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of the VIEs\u2019 stations at any time, subject to FCC consent.\nIn December 2019, Marshall, a VIE previously consolidated by Nexstar and the owner of three television stations, filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Effective on December 6, 2019, the bankruptcy court ordered the cancellation of certain contracts between Nexstar and Marshall, including the JSAs. As a result of these developments, Nexstar evaluated its business arrangements with Marshall and determined that it no longer had the power to direct the most significant economic activities of the entity and thus no longer meets the accounting criteria for a controlling financial interest in the entity. Thus, Nexstar deconsolidated Marshall\u2019s assets, liabilities and equity effective in December 2019. The SSAs between Nexstar and Marshall are currently active, but the bankruptcy court may repudiate those contracts as well and could negatively impact our operations in the three markets where Marshall stations operate.\nOn April 3, 2019, Marshall filed a lawsuit against Nexstar in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The lawsuit initially asserted eight causes of action, five of which were subsequently dismissed by the Supreme Court (the Court\u2019s order dismissing those five claims is currently on appeal). The remaining causes of action allege: (i) breach of the SSAs between Nexstar and Marshall; (ii) breach of the guaranty agreement between Nexstar and Marshall\u2019s lenders; and (iii) conversion of certain retransmission fees collected by Nexstar on Marshall\u2019s behalf. Marshall is seeking monetary and punitive damages, in addition to attorneys\u2019 fees. Nexstar denies these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously. On November 20, 2019, Nexstar filed counterclaims against Marshall and Pluria Marshall, in his individual capacity, alleging breach of the SSAs, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent conveyance. Nexstar seeks payment of the outstanding amount due under the SSAs as compensatory damages, punitive damages for the alleged fraudulent conveyances, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The parties have agreed to stay all claims pending mediation scheduled for March 2020. As of December 31, 2019, Nexstar has an outstanding receivable from Marshall for services rendered under the SSAs of $13.9 million. Additionally, Mission has an outstanding loan receivable from Marshall amounting to $48.9 million. We believe these receivables are collectible. We will continue to evaluate future developments on Marshall\u2019s bankruptcy process.\nIn compliance with FCC regulations, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for their respective stations. As a result, the VIEs\u2019 boards of directors and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and, as a consequence, the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with the VIEs. For instance, the VIEs may decide to obtain and broadcast programming which, in our opinion, would prove unpopular and/or would generate less advertising revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are currently underfunded. A declining stock market and lower interest rates could affect the value of the Company\u2019s retirement plan assets and increase its postretirement obligations.\nThe Company has various funded, qualified non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans which covers certain employees and former employees. As of December 31, 2019, these qualified retirement plans were underfunded by approximately $387.8 million. The qualified retirement plans had $2.077 billion in total net assets available to pay benefits to participants enrolled in the plans as of December 31, 2019. The Company made no contributions in 2019 to the plan.\nThe Company also has non-contributory unfunded supplemental executive retirement and ERISA excess plans which supplement the coverage of the defined benefit retirement plan to certain employees and former employees. As of December 31, 2019, the total liability was $55.1 million. The Company also has various retiree medical savings account plans which reimburses eligible retired employees for certain medical expenses and unfunded plans that provide certain health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees. Although the Company has frozen participation and benefits under all plans, two significant elements in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting obligations. Large declines in the stock market and lower discount rates increase the Company\u2019s expense and may necessitate higher cash contributions to the qualified retirement plans.\nThe recording of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results.\nThe Company currently has significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards, net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. Based on our assessment of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets, we determined that as of December 31, 2019, based on projected future income, approximately $187.8 million of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, will more likely than not be realized in the future. Should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized, the Company will be required to record a valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and the Company\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made. In addition, tax law changes could negatively impact the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to reduce future tax payments may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels or there is a change in ownership of Nexstar, Mission or certain of our other VIEs.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had NOLs of approximately $127.2 million for U.S. federal tax purposes and $280.0 million for state tax purposes. A valuation allowance has been recorded against $64.2 million of Federal NOLs and $17.6 million of State NOLs attributable to a consolidated VIE. Federal NOLs generated for years prior to 2018 expire at varying dates through 2037 and NOLs generated after 2019 carry forward indefinitely. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOLs to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups, which are generally outside of our control. The Company\u2019s NOLs are subject to limitations under Section 382. As of December 31, 2019, the Company does not expect any NOLs to expire as a result of Section 382 limitation.\nThe ability to use NOLs is also dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to generate taxable income. The NOLs could expire before the Company generates sufficient taxable income to use them. To the extent the Company\u2019s use of NOLs is significantly limited, the Company\u2019s income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if it were able to use NOLs, which could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and operations. Changes in ownership are largely beyond the Company\u2019s control and the Company can give no assurance that it will continue to have realizable NOLs.\nWe could face additional tax-related liabilities if the IRS prevails on a proposed income tax audit adjustment related to Tribune\u2019s past transaction. We may also face additional tax liabilities stemming from an ongoing tax audit of Tribune.\nWhile we believe our tax positions and reserves are reasonable, the resolutions of certain tax issues related to a past transaction of Tribune are unpredictable and could negatively impact our effective tax rate, net income or cash flows for the period or periods in question. Specifically, we may be faced with additional tax liabilities as a result of our acquisition of Tribune for the transactions contemplated by the agreement, dated August 21, 2009, between Tribune and Chicago Entertainment Ventures, LLC (formerly Chicago Baseball Holdings, LLC) (\u201cCEV LLC\u201d), and its subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cNew Cubs LLC\u201d), governing the contribution of certain assets and liabilities related to the business of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball franchise then owned by Tribune and its subsidiaries to New Cubs LLC, and related agreements thereto (the \u201cChicago Cubs Transactions\u201d).\nOn June 28, 2016, the IRS issued to Tribune a Notice of Deficiency which presented the IRS\u2019s position that the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions should have been included in Tribune\u2019s 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS has proposed a $182 million tax and a $73 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. After-tax interest on the proposed tax and penalty through December 31, 2019 would be approximately $96 million. During the third quarter of 2016, Tribune filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS\u2019s determination. A bench trial in the U.S. Tax Court took place between October 28, 2019 and November 8, 2019, and closing arguments took place on December 11, 2019. Briefing is ongoing, and an opinion on the merits is expected after briefing is complete. The U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion on January 6, 2020 that the IRS satisfied the procedural requirements for the imposition of the gross valuation misstatement penalty. Other aspects of this litigation remain in process. We continue to pursue resolution of this disputed tax matter with the IRS and we continue to disagree with the IRS\u2019s position that the transaction generated a taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS\u2019s calculation of the gain. If the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions is deemed to be taxable in 2009, we estimate that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately $225 million before interest and penalties. Any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. Tribune made approximately $147.0 million of tax payments prior to its merger with Nexstar.\nWe did not recognize any tax reserves related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions upon the Merger on September 19, 2019.\nThe revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms, or at all.\nDue to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements. As of December 31, 2019, 29 full power television stations have primary affiliation agreements with ABC, 35 with NBC, 43 with FOX, 49 with CBS, 22 with The CW and 16 with MNTV. Each of ABC, NBC and CBS generally provides affiliated stations with up to 22 hours of prime-time programming per week, while each of FOX, MNTV and The CW provides affiliated stations with up to 15 hours of prime-time programming per week. In return, affiliated stations broadcast the applicable network\u2019s commercials during the network programming.\nAll of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times through December 2023. In order to renew certain of our affiliation agreements we may be required to make cash payments to the network and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements. If any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with their networks for any reason, we would need to find alternative sources of programming, which may be less attractive to our audiences and more expensive to obtain. In addition, a loss of a specific network affiliation for a station may affect our retransmission consent payments resulting in us receiving less retransmission consent fees. Further, some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances.\nFor more information regarding these network affiliation agreements, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Network Affiliations.\u201d\nThe loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues or further change in the current retransmission consent regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of Nexstar\u2019s revenue comes from its retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs (mainly cable and satellite television providers) and OVDs. These agreements permit the distributors to retransmit our stations\u2019 and WGN America\u2019s signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us from the system operators as consideration. If we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThough we are typically able to renegotiate our retransmission consent agreements on favorable terms, the payments due us under these agreements are customarily based on a price per subscriber of the applicable distributor. In recent years the subscribership of MVPDs has declined, as the growth of direct Internet streaming of video programming to televisions and mobile devices has incentivized consumers to \u201ccut the cord\u201d and discontinue their cable or satellite service subscriptions. Decreasing MVPD subscribership leads to less revenue under our retransmission agreements, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, refer to \u201cRisks Related to Our Industry - Intense competition in the television industry and alternative forms of media could limit our growth and profitability.\u201d\nMoreover, the national television broadcast networks have taken the position that they, as the owners or licensees of certain of the programming we broadcast and provide for retransmission, are entitled to a portion of the compensation we receive from MVPDs under our retransmission consent agreements and are requiring their network affiliation agreements with us to provide for such payments. All of our affiliation agreements with the broadcast networks also include terms that limit our ability to grant retransmission consent rights to traditional MVPDs as well as OVDs, services that provide video streaming to consumers. The need to pay a portion of our retransmission consent revenue to our networks, and network limitations on our ability to enter into retransmission consent agreements, could materially reduce this revenue source to the Company and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, MVPDs are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (1) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (2) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (3) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances.\nOn March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. On December 5, 2014, the U.S. Congress extended the joint negotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market. Under this rule and the subsequent legislation, stations may not (1) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned station located in the same DMA or to a third-party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned television station in the same DMA; or (2) if located in the same DMA and not commonly owned, facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their respective retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and OVDs.\nConcurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which sought additional comment on the elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. The FCC\u2019s prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations and its possible elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules may affect the Company\u2019s ability to sustain its current level of retransmission consent revenues or grow such revenues in the future and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the resolution of the FCC\u2019s network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity proposals, or the impact of these proposals if they are adopted.\nCongress\u2019s December 5, 2014 legislation also directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking to \u201creview its totality of the circumstances test for good faith [retransmission consent] negotiations.\u201d The FCC commenced this proceeding in September 2015, and comments and reply comments were submitted in 2015 and 2016. In July 2016, the then-Chairman of the FCC announced that the agency would not adopt additional rules in this proceeding. However, the proceeding remains open.\nIn December 2019, Congress enacted and the President signed into law the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 (the \u201cTVPA\u201d). Among other things, the TVPA directs the FCC to adopt rules that require \u201clarge [television] groups\u201d (which, as defined in the statute, include Nexstar) to negotiate retransmission consent in good faith with certain \u201cqualified [MVPD] buying group[s]\u201d (as defined in the statute) comprised of multiple MVPDs. Nexstar\u2019s obligation under the TVPA to negotiate retransmission consent on a collective basis with certain groups of MVPDs may add complexity to Nexstar\u2019s overall negotiation process and could adversely affect the amount and flow of Nexstar\u2019s retransmission consent revenues. We cannot predict the effect of the TVPA and the FCC\u2019s implementing rules on our business and results of operations.\nCertain OVDs have begun streaming broadcast programming over the Internet. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OVD\u2019s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate copyright holders\u2019 exclusive right to perform their works publicly as provided under the Copyright Act. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term \u201cMVPD\u201d to encompass OVDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OVDs. Comments and reply comments were filed in 2015. Although the FCC has not classified OVDs as MVPDs to date, several OVDs have signed agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets, and others are actively seeking to negotiate such agreements. If the FCC ultimately determines that an OVD is not an MVPD or declines to apply certain rules governing MVPDs to OVDs, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe FCC could decide not to grant renewal of the FCC license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations.\nTelevision broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if, during the preceding term, the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period. However, in an extreme case, the FCC may deny a station\u2019s license renewal application, resulting in termination of the station\u2019s authority to broadcast. Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC\u2019s processing of a timely renewal application. We will be filing applications to renew our television licenses on a rolling schedule beginning in June 2020 and ending in April 2023. The Company expects the FCC to grant future renewal applications for its stations in due course but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so.\nThe loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies.\nWe believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of Perry A. Sook, our founder and President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus. The loss of Mr. Sook\u2019s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies.\nThe Company\u2019s growth may be limited if it is unable to implement its acquisition strategy.\nThe Company has achieved much of its growth through acquisitions. The Company intends to continue its growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations. The television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation, which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets. Therefore, even if the Company is successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets, it may face considerable competition and its acquisition strategy may not be successful.\nFCC rules and policies may also make it more difficult for the Company to acquire additional television stations. Television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the FCC and, potentially, other regulatory authorities. FCC rules limit the number of television stations a company may own and define the types of local service agreements that \u201ccount\u201d as ownership by the party providing the services. Those rules are subject to change. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to consummate future transactions, if, for example, the FCC or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration or other public interest detriment in a market, even if the proposed combination may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations. Additionally, our television acquisitions over the past several years have significantly increased the Company\u2019s national audience reach to a level that approaches national television ownership limits imposed by the Communications Act and FCC rules. This may restrict future television station acquisitions by the Company and may require the Company to divest current stations in connection with any acquisition in order to comply with national television ownership limits.\nGrowing the Company\u2019s business through acquisitions involves risks and if it is unable to manage effectively its growth, its operating results will suffer.\nIn 2019, we completed our merger with Tribune and acquired 31 full power television stations and one AM radio station in 23 markets (net of divestitures of 13 Tribune stations), WGN America, a national general entertainment cable network, a 31.3% ownership stake in TV Food Network and a portfolio of real estate assets. In the same transaction, we also sold eight of our legacy stations. In 2017, we completed our merger with Media General, Inc. (\u201cMedia General\u201d) and acquired 71 full power stations in 42 markets (net of divestitures of 7 Media General stations). In the same transaction, we also sold five of our legacy stations. To manage effectively its growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions, the Company will need, among other things, to continue to develop its financial and management controls and management information systems. The Company will also need to continue to identify, attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel. Failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm its business.\nThere are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to successfully reduce costs, increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter and fail to address risks or other problems associated with or arising from our reliance on the representations and warranties and related indemnities, if any, provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities;\n\u2022\nour management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business;\n\u2022\nwe may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies and cultures;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to retain and grow relationships with the acquired company\u2019s key customers;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nproblems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition.\nFCC actions may restrict our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements or common ownership, which may harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy.\nIn a number of our markets, we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements. While these agreements take varying forms, a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station, subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station\u2019s owner. By operating or entering into local service agreements with same-market stations, we (and the other station) achieve significant operational efficiencies. We also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market. Additionally, we achieve significant operational efficiencies by owning multiple stations in a market where FCC rules allow us to do so.\nThe FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the \u201cpublic interest, convenience and necessity.\u201d In August 2016, the FCC adopted the 2016 Ownership Order concluding the agency\u2019s 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews. The 2016 Ownership Order (1) retained the local television ownership rule and radio/television cross-ownership rule with minor technical modifications, (2) extended the ban on common ownership of two top-four television stations in a market to network affiliation swaps, (3) retained the ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership in local markets while considering waivers and providing an exception for failed or failing entities, (4) retained the dual network rule, (5) made television JSA relationships attributable interests, and (6) defined a category of sharing agreements designated as SSAs between commercial television stations and required public disclosure of those SSAs (while not considering them attributable).\nNexstar and other parties filed petitions seeking reconsideration of various aspects of the 2016 Ownership Order. On November 16, 2017, the FCC adopted the Reconsideration Order addressing the petitions for reconsideration. The Reconsideration Order (1) eliminated the rules prohibiting newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership and limiting television/radio cross-ownership, (2) eliminated the eight voices test, (3) retained the general prohibition on common ownership of two \u201ctop four\u201d stations in a local market but provided for case-by-case review, (4) eliminated the television JSA attribution rule, and (5) retained the SSA definition and disclosure requirement for television stations. These rule modifications took effect on February 7, 2018, when the Third Circuit denied a mandamus petition which had sought to stay their effectiveness. On September 23, 2019, however, the Third Circuit issued an opinion vacating the Reconsideration Order on the ground that the FCC had failed to adequately analyze the effect of the Reconsideration Order\u2019s deregulatory rule changes on minority and woman ownership of broadcast stations. The Third Circuit later denied petitions for en banc rehearing and its decision took effect on November 29, 2019. On December 20, 2019, the FCC issued an order reinstating the local television ownership rule, the radio/television cross-ownership rule, the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and the television JSA attribution rule as they existed prior to the Reconsideration Order (including the eight voices test with respect to local television ownership). There is the possibility of further litigation regarding the Third Circuit\u2019s September 2019 opinion.\nIn December 2018, the FCC initiated its 2018 quadrennial review with the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Among other things, the FCC seeks comment on all aspects of the local television ownership rule\u2019s implementation and whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest. Comments and reply comments in the 2018 quadrennial review were filed in the second quarter of 2019.\nThe 2016 Ownership Order reinstated a rule that attributed another in-market station toward the local television ownership limits when one station owner sells more than 15% of the second station\u2019s weekly advertising inventory under a JSA (this rule had been previously adopted but was vacated by the Third Circuit). Parties to JSAs entered into prior to March 31, 2014 were permitted to continue to operate under these JSAs until September 30, 2025. In the Reconsideration Order, the FCC eliminated the JSA attribution rule in its entirety. As a result of the Third Circuit\u2019s September 2019 opinion vacating the Reconsideration Order, the rule has been reinstated, although further litigation is possible.\nWe cannot predict what additional rules the FCC will adopt or when they will be adopted. In addition, uncertainty about media ownership regulations and adverse economic conditions have dampened the acquisition market from time to time, and changes in the regulatory approval process may make materially more expensive, or may materially delay, the Company\u2019s ability to close upon currently pending acquisitions or consummate further acquisitions in the future.\nThe FCC may decide to terminate \u201cgrandfathered\u201d time brokerage agreements.\nThe FCC attributes TBAs and LMAs to the programmer under its ownership limits if the programmer provides more than 15% of a station\u2019s weekly broadcast programming. However, TBAs and LMAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt from attribution for now.\nThe FCC may review these \u201cgrandfathered\u201d TBAs and LMAs in the future. During this review, the FCC may determine to terminate the \u201cgrandfathered\u201d period and make all TBAs and LMAs fully attributable to the programmer. If the FCC does so, we will be required to terminate or modify our grandfathered TBAs and LMAs unless the FCC\u2019s rules allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets. As of December 31, 2019, we provide services under \u201cgrandfathered\u201d TBAs or LMAs to five television stations owned by third parties.\nWe are subject to foreign ownership limitations which limits foreign investments in us.\nThe Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company unless the FCC determines the public interest will not be served by enforcement of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision to require an affirmative public interest showing before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%. Therefore, certain investors may be prevented from investing in us if our foreign ownership is at or near the FCC limits.\nThe FCC\u2019s multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets, restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy.\nThe number of television stations we may acquire in any local market or nationwide is limited by FCC rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under FCC rules. The broadcast television, broadcast radio and daily newspaper interests of our officers, directors and most stockholders with 5% or greater voting power are attributable under the FCC\u2019s rules, which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers, directors or stockholders are associated with us. In addition, the holder of otherwise non-attributable equity and/or debt in a licensee in excess of 33% of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station in the same market that is subject to the FCC\u2019s media ownership rules.\nThe Company has a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets, and therefore the Company could suffer additional losses due to future asset impairment charges.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $9.2 billion, or 65.6%, of the Company\u2019s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets, including FCC licenses and network affiliation agreements. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $63.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 attributable to the goodwill of its digital businesses. The Company tests goodwill and FCC licenses annually, and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets, in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company tests its finite-lived intangible assets whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent that the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows. The methods used to evaluate the impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction, or a forecast of such reductions, in operating results or cash flows at the Company\u2019s broadcast or digital businesses. Our broadcast business\u2019 operating results and cash flows could be affected by a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which the Company\u2019s television stations operate, the loss of network affiliations or by adverse changes to FCC ownership rules, among others, which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. Our digital business\u2019 operating results and cash flows could be affected by intense competition, investment in technologies that are subject to a greater degree of obsolescence, significant reliance on third-party vendors to deliver services, rapid evolving nature and other factors. If the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment, such non-cash charge could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments and any decrease or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors has declared in 2019 a total cash dividend with respect to the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock of $1.80 per share in equal quarterly installments of $0.45 per share. On January 30, 2020, our board of directors approved a 24.4% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.56 per share of outstanding Class A Common Stock beginning with the first quarter of 2020. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and can be changed or discontinued at any time. Dividend determinations (including the amount of the cash dividend, the record date and date of payment) will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, targeted future acquisitions, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes limit our ability to pay dividends. Given these considerations, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future.\nWe have made investments in digital businesses.\nWe have invested in various digital media businesses as well as digital offerings for each of our broadcast stations. Due to intense competition, investment in technologies that are subject to a greater degree of obsolescence, historical impairment losses on our digital assets, significant reliance on third-party vendors to deliver services, limited operating history, the rapid evolving nature of digital businesses and difficulties in integrating acquisitions into our operations, the actual future operating results could be volatile and negatively impact the year-to-year trends of our operations.\nWe may incur significant costs to address contamination issues at sites we acquired from Tribune.\nWe may incur costs in connection with the investigation or remediation of contamination at sites we acquired from Tribune. Historical operations at these sites may have resulted in releases of hazardous materials to soil or groundwater. In addition, we could be required to contribute to cleanup costs at third-party waste disposal facilities at which wastes were disposed. In connection with Tribune\u2019s spin-off of the assets (other than owned real estate and certain other assets) and certain liabilities related to Tribune\u2019s then principal publishing operations to Tribune Publishing Company (\u201cTribune Publishing\u201d), Tribune Publishing agreed to indemnify Tribune for costs related to certain identified contamination issues at sites owned, operated or used by Tribune Publishing. In turn, Tribune agreed to indemnify Tribune Publishing for certain other environmental liabilities. Environmental liabilities, including investigation and remediation obligations, could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations involving us can impact our business practices and operating results.\nWe are party to various litigation and regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted.\nThe financial performance of equity method investments that we acquired could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have significant investments in businesses (primarily TV Food Network) that we account for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, we report our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of our equity affiliates in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income under \u201cIncome (loss) on equity investments, net,\u201d which contributes to our income from continuing operations before income taxes. From September 19, 2019 to December 31, 2019, our income from equity investments from TV Food Network, net was $20.5 million. During this period, we received cash distribution from TV Food Network of $14.8 million. If the earnings or losses of our equity investments are material in any year, those earnings or losses may have a material effect on our net income and financial condition and liquidity. We do not control the day-to-day operations of our equity method investments or have the ability to cause them to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to their stockholders, including us, and thus the management of these businesses could impact our results of operations. Additionally, these businesses are subject to laws, regulations, market conditions and other risks inherent in their operations. Any of these factors could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur business relies on a combination of patented and patent-pending technology, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect its technology, intellectual property and brand names. We believe our proprietary technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position. Any impairment of any such intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the results of our operations or financial condition.\nWe seek to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of our broadcasts, products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by us may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Protection of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy.\nFurthermore, any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected as a result.\nCybersecurity risks could affect the Company\u2019s operating effectiveness.\nThe Company uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations. Its revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes the Company to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. It is not uncommon for a company such as ours to be subjected to continuous attempted cyber-attacks or other malicious efforts to cause a cyber incident. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. The Company\u2019s Cybersecurity Committee helps mitigate cybersecurity risks. The role of the committee is to oversee cyber risk assessments, monitor applicable key risk indicators, review cybersecurity training procedures, establish cybersecurity policies and procedures, and to invest in and implement enhancements to the Company\u2019s cybersecurity infrastructure. Investments over the past year included enhancements to monitoring systems, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond our control than businesses not dependent on advertising.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising time on our stations and community portal websites. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe popularity of our station and website programming;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising;\n\u2022\nthe activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media, particularly newspapers, cable television, Internet and radio;\n\u2022\nthe decreased demand for political advertising in non-election years; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located.\nBecause businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns, the reliance upon advertising revenue makes our operating results susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership, and we may not achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity, which could cause our advertising revenue to decline. Further, we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate, and effectively react to, shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets.\nBecause a high percentage of our operating expense is fixed, a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.\nOur business is characterized generally by high fixed costs, primarily for debt service, broadcast rights and personnel. Other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies, our expenses do not vary significantly with an increase or decrease in advertising revenue. As a result, a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.\nPreemption of regularly scheduled programming by news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe Company may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack or by coverage of local disasters, such as tornados and hurricanes. As a result, advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed-upon times in the future. Advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods, and space may not be available for such advertising. The duration of any preemption of programming cannot be predicted if it occurs. In addition, our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack or local disaster. The loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends, our television businesses may not be able to compete effectively.\nNew technologies may adversely affect our television stations. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view, video on demand, online distribution of programming, the Internet, telephone company services, mobile devices, digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized television viewing audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access. Over the past decade, cable television programming services, other emerging video distribution platforms and the Internet have captured an increasing market share, while the aggregate viewership of the major television networks has declined. In addition, the expansion of cable and satellite television, digital delivery and other technological changes has increased, and may continue to increase, the competitive demand for programming. Such increased demand, together with rising production costs, may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire or develop desired programming.\nIn addition, video compression techniques now in use are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth. These compression techniques and other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to targeted audiences. Reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming, resulting in more audience fractionalization. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. Furthermore, the FCC has authorized television broadcasters to transmit using a so-called \u201cNext Gen\u201d (ATSC 3.0) standard on a voluntary, market-driven basis. This new transmission standard may allow broadcast television stations to provide a multitude of enhanced services to consumers, including but not limited to the delivery of ultra-high definition video and advanced audio to home and mobile screens, new public safety capabilities such as advanced emergency alerting, and localized, personalized and interactive content. We are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or our results of operations.\nThe FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent.\nThe FCC may impose substantial fines, exceeding $400,000 per violation (and subject to annual adjustments for inflation), on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the Communications Act and its rules. Because the Company\u2019s programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated, the Company does not have full control over what is broadcast on its stations and may be subject to the imposition of fines if the FCC finds such programming to be indecent.\nIn June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC\u2019s indecency enforcement without resolving the constitutionality of such enforcement, and the FCC thereafter requested public comment on the appropriate substance and scope of its indecency enforcement policy. The FCC has issued very few further decisions or rules in this area, and the courts may in the future have further occasion to review the FCC\u2019s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntense competition in the television industry and alternative forms of media could limit our growth and profitability.\nAs a television broadcasting company, we face a significant level of competition, both directly and indirectly. We generally compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television. Specifically, stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share, programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media, including newspapers, radio stations, cable television, DBS systems, mobile services, video streaming services and the Internet.\nThe entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, programming and broadcasting resources than we do. The markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from, among other things, technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments. Technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment, such as cable television, wireless cable, satellite-to-home distribution services, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems and Internet and mobile distribution of video programming have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over-the-air television broadcast stations to increased competition. We may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions.\nTechnologies used in the entertainment industry continue to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through the so-called \u201ccutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies. The networks have also begun streaming some of their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms simultaneously with, or in close proximity to, network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own or provide services to. These innovations and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and may adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations. We are unable to predict what forms of competition will develop in the future, the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our business.\nThe FCC could implement regulations or the U.S. Congress could adopt legislation that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole.\nThe FCC has open proceedings to determine whether to standardize TV stations\u2019 reporting of programming responsive to local needs and interests; whether to modify its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; whether to modify its standards for \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations; and whether to broaden the definition of \u201cMVPD\u201d to include online video programming distributors. Additionally, the outcomes of FCC proceedings to determine whether to modify or eliminate certain of its broadcast ownership rules have in some cases been negated by court review and may be the subject of further litigation, and the FCC has initiated its next quadrennial proceeding to review the agency\u2019s media ownership rules.\nThe FCC also may decide to initiate other new rule-making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties, any of which might have such an impact. The U.S. Congress may also act to amend the Communications Act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general.\nThe FCC is reallocating a portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband use, which could substantially impact our future operations and may reduce viewer access to our programming.\nThe FCC is in the process of repurposing a portion of the broadcast television spectrum for wireless broadband use. Pursuant to federal legislation enacted in 2012, the FCC conducted an incentive auction for the purpose of making additional spectrum available to meet future wireless broadband needs. Under the auction statute and rules, certain television broadcasters accepted bids from the FCC to voluntarily relinquish their spectrum in exchange for consideration, and certain wireless broadband providers and other entities submitted successful bids to acquire the relinquished television spectrum. Television stations that are not relinquishing their spectrum are being \u201crepacked\u201d into the frequency band still remaining for television broadcast use.\nThe incentive auction commenced on March 29, 2016 and officially concluded on April 13, 2017. Ten of Nexstar\u2019s stations and one station owned by Vaughan, a consolidated VIE, accepted bids to relinquish their spectrum. Of these 11 total stations, one station went off the air in November 2017. The station that went off the air did not have a significant impact on our financial results because it was located in a remote rural area of the country and the Company has other stations which serve the same area. Of the remaining ten stations, eight have ceased broadcasting on their current channels and implemented channel sharing arrangements. Of the two remaining stations, one moved to a very high frequency (\u201cVHF\u201d) channel and vacated its former channel in 2019 and the remaining station is moving to VHF channel and must vacate its current channel by May 2020.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s television stations did not accept bids to relinquish their television channels. Of those stations, 61 full power stations owned by Nexstar and 17 full power stations owned by VIEs were assigned to new channels in the reduced post-auction television band. These \u201crepacked\u201d stations are required to construct and license the necessary technical modifications to operate on their new assigned channels and must cease operating on their former channels on a rolling schedule ending in July 2020. Congress has allocated up to an industry-wide total of $2.75 billion to reimburse television broadcasters, MVPDs and other parties for costs reasonably incurred due to the repack. This allocation includes $1 billion added to the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. This fund is not available to reimburse repacking costs for stations which are surrendering their spectrum and entering into channel sharing relationships. Broadcasters, MVPDs and other parties have submitted to the FCC estimates of their reimbursable costs and, in many cases, subsequent requests for reimbursement of those costs. As of December 6, 2019, verified cost estimates for repack stations and MVPDs were approximately $1.95 billion, with 79 percent of the repack complete and reimbursements still to be made to certain low power television and FM radio stations affected by the repack. During the three years ended December 31, 2019, the Company spent a total of $108.7 million in capital expenditures related to station repack, of which $99.7 million were reimbursed by the FCC in 2019 during the same period, with the remainder expected to be reimbursed. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $92.7 million of estimated remaining costs in connection with the station repack are expected to be incurred by the Company, some or all of which will be reimbursable. We cannot determine if the FCC will be able to fully reimburse our repacking costs as this is dependent on certain factors, including our ability to incur repacking costs that are equal to or less than the FCC\u2019s allocation of funds to us and whether the FCC will have available funds to reimburse us for additional repacking costs that we previously may not have anticipated. Whether the FCC will have available funds for additional reimbursements will also depend on the repacking costs that will be incurred by other broadcasters, MVPDs and other parties that are also seeking reimbursements.\nThe reallocation of television spectrum to broadband use may be to the detriment of our investment in digital facilities, could require substantial additional investment to continue our current operations, and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals. We cannot predict the impact of the incentive auction and subsequent repack on our business.\nRisks Related to Tribune\u2019s Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe may not be able to settle, on a favorable basis or at all, unresolved claims filed in connection with Tribune\u2019s Chapter 11 proceedings and resolve the appeals seeking to overturn the order confirming the Tribune\u2019s bankruptcy plan (as defined below).\nOn December 31, 2012, certain entities (including Tribune and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries) that had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) on December 8, 2008 (or on October 12, 2009, in the case of Tribune CNLBC, LLC) (the \u201cDebtors\u201d) emerged from Chapter 11. Certain of the Debtors\u2019 Chapter 11 cases have not yet been closed by the Bankruptcy Court, and certain claims asserted against the Debtors in the Chapter 11 cases remain unresolved. As a result, we expect to continue to incur certain expenses pertaining to the Chapter 11 proceedings in future periods, which may be material.\nOn April 12, 2012, the Debtors, the official committee of unsecured creditors, and creditors under certain prepetition debt facilities filed a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the \u201cPlan\u201d) with the Bankruptcy Court. On July 23, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming the Plan (the \u201cConfirmation Order\u201d).\nSeveral notices of appeal of the Confirmation Order were filed. The appellants sought, among other relief, to overturn the Confirmation Order and certain prior orders of the Bankruptcy Court, in whole or in part, including the settlement of certain causes of action relating to the Leveraged ESOP Transactions consummated by Tribune and Tribune\u2019s employee stock ownership plan, EGI-TRB, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by Sam Investment Trust (a trust established for the benefit of Samuel Zell and his family) (the \u201cZell Entity\u201d) and Samuel Zell in 2007, that was embodied in the Plan. See Note 17-Commitment and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nMore specifically, notices of appeal were filed on August 2, 2012 by Wilmington Trust Company (\u201cWTC\u201d), as successor indenture trustee for the Predecessor\u2019s Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures due 2029 (\u201cPHONES\u201d), and on August 3, 2012 by the Zell Entity, Aurelius Capital Management LP, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York (n/k/a Delaware Trust Company) (\u201cDelaware Trust Company\u201d), successor trustee under the indenture for the Predecessor\u2019s prepetition 6.61% debentures due 2027 and the 7.25% debentures due 2096, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, successor trustee under the indentures for the Predecessor\u2019s prepetition medium-term notes due 2008, 4.875% notes due 2010, 5.25% notes due 2015, 7.25% debentures due 2013 and 7.5% debentures due 2023. WTC and the Zell Entity also sought to overturn determinations made by the Bankruptcy Court concerning the priority in right of payment of the PHONES and the subordinated promissory notes held by the Zell Entity and its permitted assignees, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, each of the Confirmation Order appeals have been dismissed or otherwise resolved by a final order, with the exception of the appeals of Delaware Trust Company and Deutsche Bank. On July 30, 2018, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) entered an order affirming (i) the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment overruling Delaware Trust Company\u2019s and Deutsche Bank\u2019s objections to confirmation of the Plan and (ii) the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming the Plan. Delaware Trust Company and Deutsche Bank appealed the District Court\u2019s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the \u201cThird Circuit\u201d) on August 27, 2018. That appeal remains pending before the Third Circuit. If the remaining appellants succeed on their appeals, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Tribune Publishing\u2019s Spin-Off\nIf the Tribune Publishing spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of Tribune or Tribune Publishing, then Tribune may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nOn August 4, 2014, Tribune completed a separation transaction, resulting in the spin-off of the assets (other than owned real estate and certain other assets) and certain liabilities of the businesses primarily related to Tribune\u2019s then principal publishing operations through a tax-free, pro rata dividend to its stockholders and warrantholders of 98.5% of the shares of common stock of Tribune Publishing. At that time, Tribune retained 1.5% of the outstanding common stock of Tribune Publishing. The publishing operations consisted of newspaper publishing and local news and information gathering functions that operated daily newspapers and related websites, as well as a number of ancillary businesses that leveraged certain of the assets of those businesses. As a result of the completion of the spin-off, Tribune Publishing operates the Publishing Business as an independent, publicly-traded company. On January 31, 2017, Tribune sold its remaining Tribune Publishing shares.\nIn connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off, Tribune received a private letter ruling (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the IRS to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions qualified as tax-free to Tribune, its then stockholders and warrantholders and Tribune Publishing for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS Ruling did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution, and the parties have relied on the opinion of special tax counsel, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions qualified as tax-free to Tribune and its then stockholders and warrantholders. The opinion of the special tax counsel relied on the IRS Ruling as to matters covered by it.\nThe IRS Ruling and the opinion of the special tax counsel were based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by Tribune and certain of its then stockholders. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the IRS Ruling or the opinion of the special tax counsel. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the IRS Ruling and the opinion of the special tax counsel were based on the current law then in effect, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect.\nIf the Tribune Publishing spin-off is ultimately determined not to be tax free, we could be liable for the U.S. federal and state income taxes imposed as a result of the transaction. Furthermore, events subsequent to the distribution could cause us to recognize a taxable gain in connection therewith. Although Tribune Publishing is required to indemnify us against taxes on the distribution that arise after the distribution as a result of actions or failures to act by Tribune Publishing or any member thereof, Tribune Publishing\u2019s failure to meet such obligations and our administrative and legal costs in enforcing such obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws and Delaware corporate law may permit a court to void the Tribune Publishing spin-off, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off, Tribune undertook several corporate reorganization transactions which, along with the contribution of the Tribune Publishing business, the distribution of Tribune Publishing shares and the cash dividend that was paid to Tribune, may be subject to challenge under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws as well as under Delaware corporate law, even though the Tribune Publishing spin-off has been completed. Under applicable laws, any transaction, contribution or distribution contemplated as part of the Tribune Publishing spin-off could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if, among other things, the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for, and was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of, the transfer.\nWe cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not any entity involved in the Tribune Publishing spin-off was insolvent at the relevant time. In general, however, a court would look at various facts and circumstances related to the entity in question, including evaluation of whether or not:\n\u2022 the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair market value of all of its assets;\n\u2022 the present fair market value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n\u2022 it could pay its debts as they become due.\nIf a court were to find that any transaction, contribution or distribution involved in the Tribune Publishing spin-off was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the transaction, contribution or distribution. In addition, the distribution could also be voided if a court were to find that it is not a legal distribution or dividend under Delaware corporate law. The resulting complications, costs and expenses of either finding would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to additional liabilities as a result of the Tribune Publishing spin-off.\nThe separation and distribution agreement Tribune entered into in connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off sets forth the distribution of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of Tribune and Tribune Publishing following the spin-off, and includes indemnification obligations for such liabilities and obligations. In addition, pursuant to the tax matters agreement, certain income tax liabilities and related responsibilities are allocated between, and indemnification obligations have been assumed by, each of Tribune and Tribune Publishing. In connection with the Tribune Publishing spin-off, Tribune also entered into an employee matters agreement, pursuant to which certain obligations with respect to employee benefit plans were allocated to Tribune Publishing. Each company will rely on the other company to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. Certain of the liabilities to be assumed or indemnified by Tribune or Tribune Publishing under these agreements are legal or contractual liabilities of the other company. However, it could be later determined that Tribune must retain certain of the liabilities allocated to Tribune Publishing pursuant to these agreements, including with respect to certain multiemployer benefit plans, which amounts could be material. Furthermore, if Tribune Publishing were to breach or be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, Tribune could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.", "PERMNO": 89916, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "NXST"}
