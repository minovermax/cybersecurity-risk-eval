{"cik": "1059556", "company": "MOODYS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in the Company\u2019s securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and elsewhere. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results (including components of the Company\u2019s financial results such as sales and profits), cash flows and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that Moody\u2019s faces. The Company could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not consider to present significant risks. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below.\nA. Legal and Regulatory Risks\nMoody\u2019s Faces Risks Related to U.S. Laws and Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry and Moody\u2019s Customers.\nMoody\u2019s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S., including the Reform Act and the Financial Reform Act. These regulations are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. Additionally, the change in the Presidential administration and changes in Congress may increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new or existing legislation or directives by government authorities. See \u201cRegulation\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information. The current laws and regulations:\n-seek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among CRAs and in the credit rating business;\n-may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings;\n-restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;\n-increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and CRA operations;\n-provide the SEC with direct jurisdiction over CRAs that seek NRSRO status, and grant authority to the SEC to inspect the operations of CRAs; and\n-provide for enhanced oversight standards and specialized pleading standards, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs.\nIf these laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking or court rulings, reduce demand for credit ratings or increase costs, Moody\u2019s may be unable to pass such costs through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. The Company\u2019s compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions can result in significant expenses. Legal proceedings that are increasingly lengthy can result in uncertainty over and exposure to liability.\nIt is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on Moody\u2019s business and its customers\u2019 businesses. For example, new laws and regulations may affect MIS\u2019s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which MIS\u2019s credit ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for MIS\u2019s credit ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for CRAs. Further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect Moody\u2019s stock price. Although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to CRAs and credit markets generally, they may affect Moody\u2019s in a disproportionate manner. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and can have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.\nMOODY'S 2020 10-K 29\nIn addition, MA derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight. U.S. banking regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Board, as well as many state agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with third-party relationships, which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity, by contract or otherwise, and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider\u2019s business arrangement with third-party service providers, and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their third-party relationships. In light of this, MA\u2019s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought to and may further revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with MA. This can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers, adversely affect MA\u2019s relationship with such customers, increase the costs of doing business with such customers and/or result in MA assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers.\nMoody\u2019s Faces Risks Related to Financial Reforms Outside the U.S. Affecting the Credit Rating Industry and Moody\u2019s Customers.\nIn addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations governing the industry, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to regulate CRAs and the markets for credit ratings. In particular, the EU has adopted a common regulatory framework for CRAs operating in the EU and continues to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation. Ratings emanating from outside the EU are subject to ESMA\u2019s oversight if they are endorsed into the EU. Additionally, other foreign jurisdictions have recently taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and markets for ratings. See \u201cRegulation\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information.\nThe EU and other jurisdictions, as discussed further below, adopt legislation and engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that significantly impacts operations and the markets for the Company's products and services. Future laws and regulations could extend to products and services not currently regulated. These regulations could: (i) affect the need for debt securities to be rated, (ii) expand supervisory remits to include non-EU ratings used for regulatory purposes, (iii) increase the level of competition in the market for credit ratings, (iv) establish criteria for credit ratings or limit the entities authorized to provide credit ratings, and (iv) restrict the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of personal information by CRAs, or (v) regulate pricing (such that fees that are based on costs and are non-discriminatory) on products and services provided by MA such as those products that incorporate ratings and research originated by MIS. Future regulations could also affect products and services the Company offers in the ESG sector (including those offered by Moody\u2019s ESG Solutions Group).\nAdditionally, as of the date of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there remains uncertainty regarding the impact that Brexit will have on the credit rating industry within the U.K., the EU and other jurisdictions. The U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020, thereby entering an 11-month implementation period. The Brexit implementation period ended on December 31, 2020. Following the Brexit implementation period, the MIS U.K. registered CRA ceased to be registered with and regulated by ESMA and became subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. Regulatory arrangements put in place in both the U.K. and the EU allow credit ratings to be available for regulatory use in both the EU and the U.K. after the end of the Brexit-implementation period. MIS has put arrangements in place to endorse its U.K. credit ratings into the EU and its EU credit ratings into the U.K. The U.K. and the EU are expected to agree by March 2021 to a memorandum of understanding establishing the framework for structured regulatory cooperation on financial services. The contents and extent of the memorandum of understanding are currently unclear, and therefore the impact on Moody\u2019s customers and other stakeholders is currently uncertain.\nBoth of Moody\u2019s segments face risks related to financial reforms outside the U.S. affecting the credit rating industry and Moody\u2019s customers. MIS is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic or other inspections in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions, such as, but not limited to, Hong Kong and China, where it operates through registered subsidiaries. For example:\n-In the EU, applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, and restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed. Additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules regarding the organization of CRAs, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest, including fees that are based on costs and are non-discriminatory, and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments.\n30 MOODY'S 2020 10-K\n-In Hong Kong, applicable rules include liability for the intentional or negligent dissemination of false and misleading information and procedural requirements for the notification of certain matters to regulators. In addition, MIS Hong Kong is subject to a code of conduct applicable to CRAs that impose procedural and substantive requirements on the preparation and issuance of credit ratings, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including the disclosure of its compensation arrangements with rated entities and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments. A failure to comply with these procedural and substantive requirements also exposes MIS Hong Kong to the risk of regulatory enforcement action which could result in financial penalties or, in serious cases, its ability to conduct credit rating activities in Hong Kong.\n-In China, while MIS is not a licensed credit rating agency, it does issue global credit ratings from offices outside of China regarding Chinese issuers. In addition, the Company holds a 30% investment in a credit rating agency licensed in China. China has laws applicable to domestic credit rating agencies as well as foreign investment in such entities and entities in general (including national security review). Such laws are broadly crafted and the implementation and interpretation of such laws are subject to the broad discretion of Chinese regulators, which could affect our ability to conduct business in China.\n-In addition, U.S. economic sanctions have increasingly targeted Chinese persons. In response, China recently issued a blocking statute that establishes a framework for limiting the effect of foreign sanctions on Chinese persons. Blocking statutes typically create conflicts of law. An entity that is subject to conflicting laws in multiple jurisdictions may need to determine a means to comply with such laws. Such conflicts could eventually affect the ability of entities to adhere to applicable laws.\nWith respect to MA, regulators in Europe and other foreign markets in which MA is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the U.S. relating to financial institutions\u2019 assessment and management of risks associated with third-party relationships. In light of this, MA\u2019s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought and may further revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with MA. This can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers, adversely affect MA\u2019s relationship with such customers, increase the costs of doing business with such customers and/or result in MA assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers.\nAlthough Moody\u2019s will monitor developments related to financial reforms outside the U.S. affecting the credit rating industry and Moody\u2019s customers, Moody\u2019s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations, and the effect that they will have on Moody\u2019s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant. For example, compliance with the EU and other foreign regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on Moody\u2019s operations, profitability or ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services, including in ways that Moody\u2019s presently is unable to predict. In addition, exposure to increased liability under the EU regulations and regulations of other foreign jurisdictions may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact Moody\u2019s results of operations. Financial reforms in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Faces Exposure to Litigation and Government Regulatory Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries Related to Rating Opinions and Other Business Practices.\nMoody\u2019s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to MIS\u2019s ratings actions, as well as other business practices and products within both MIS and MA. If the market value of credit-dependent instruments declines or defaults, whether as a result of difficult economic times, turbulent markets or otherwise, the number of investigations and legal proceedings that Moody\u2019s faces could increase significantly. Parties who invest in securities rated by MIS may pursue claims against MIS or Moody\u2019s for losses they face in their portfolios. For instance, Moody\u2019s faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation, government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time to addressing other business issues, and any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions. Risks relating to legal proceedings are heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. Moody\u2019s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, when Moody\u2019s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by Moody\u2019s increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome.\nMOODY'S 2020 10-K 31\nAdditionally, as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, Moody\u2019s will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates, which could require Moody\u2019s to record or increase liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the Company currently faces. Due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought, there is a risk that Moody\u2019s will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results that have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Its Compliance and Risk Management Programs.\nMoody\u2019s operates in a number of countries, and as a result the Company is required to comply and quickly adapt with numerous international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, antitrust and securities trading laws, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel. Moody\u2019s policies and procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the Company\u2019s risks, including risks resulting from acquisitions, may not be fully effective, and Moody\u2019s employees or agents may engage in misconduct, fraud or other errors. It is not always possible to deter such errors, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. If Moody\u2019s employees violate its policies or if the Company\u2019s risk management methods are not effective, the Company may be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of the Company\u2019s employees, fines, penalties, regulatory sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets or other penalties, and may suffer harm to its reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nMoody\u2019s Faces Risks Related to Protecting Its Intellectual Property Rights.\nMoody\u2019s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively. Businesses the Company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges the Company faces in protecting its strategic advantage. In addition, the Company\u2019s operating results can be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. The lack of strong legal and technological intellectual property protections in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may increase our vulnerability and may pose risks to our business. From time to time, laws are passed that require publication of certain information, in some cases at no cost, that the Company considers to be its intellectual property and that it currently sells or licenses for a fee, which could result in lost revenue.\nUnauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the Company regards as proprietary. It is also possible that Moody\u2019s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that Moody\u2019s offers, and attempt to require Moody\u2019s to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing, or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services. Even if Moody\u2019s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. The Company\u2019s ability to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft, misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient and/or changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets. These risks, and the cost, time and resources needed to address them, may increase as the Company\u2019s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the United States.\nMoody\u2019s Faces Risks Related to Tax Matters, Including Changes in Tax Rates or Tax Rules.\nAs a global company, Moody\u2019s is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is determined based on the taxable income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Moody\u2019s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors, including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where Moody\u2019s faces higher tax rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which Moody\u2019s is not able to realize the related tax benefit, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, policies and administrative practices, or changes to their interpretation or enforcement, including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting initiative being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, and the European Union\u2019s state aid rulings, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries.\n32 MOODY'S 2020 10-K\nFor example, the Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. federal tax laws. Many aspects of the legislation remain uncertain or unclear and may not be clarified for some time. As additional regulatory guidance is issued interpreting or clarifying the Tax Act or if the tax accounting rules are modified, there may be adjustments or changes to the Company\u2019s determination of its mandatory one-time deemed repatriation tax liability (\u201ctransition tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries recorded in 2017. Additional regulatory guidance may also affect the Company\u2019s expected future effective tax rates and tax assets and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, the Tax Act may impact the volume of debt securities issued as discussed in the Risk Factor, Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets, Asset Levels and Flows into Investment Levels and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company\u2019s Business. Additionally, a change in the Presidential administration and changes in Congress increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in the U.S. federal tax laws and the interpretation or enforcement of legislation or directives by tax authorities.\nIn addition, Moody\u2019s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and the Company is experiencing increased scrutiny as its business grows. Moody\u2019s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits; however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the Company. Although the Company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions, accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nB. Risks Relating to our Business\nThe Company is Exposed to Legal, Economic, Operational and Regulatory Risks of Operating in Multiple Jurisdictions.\nMoody\u2019s conducts operations in various countries outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources. Changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the Company operates have an impact on the Company\u2019s business. For example, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone or elsewhere, including, but not limited to, in Latin America or China, affects the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas. In addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section, operations abroad expose Moody\u2019s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:\n-exposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and USD;\n-restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into USD and the costs, including the tax impact, of repatriating cash held by entities outside the U.S.;\n-U.S. laws affecting overseas operations, including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions, such as those related to the U.S.\u2019s relationship with China and embargoes and sanctions laws with respect to Russia and Venezuela;\n-differing and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards, including as a result of Brexit;\n-uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU;\n-current and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by issuers of securities;\n-uncertain and evolving laws and regulations, including those applicable to the financial services industries, such as the European Union\u2019s implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, MiFID II, in January 2018, and to the protection of intellectual property;\n-the transition away from benchmark reference rates based on market participant judgements, such as LIBOR and EURIBOR, to rates based on observable transactions, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR);\n-uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and China, which may result in further restrictions or actions by the U.S. government with respect to doing business in China and/or by the Chinese government with respect to business conducted by foreign entities in China;\n-economic, political and geopolitical market conditions, including the effect of these conditions on customers and customer retention;\n-the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;\nMOODY'S 2020 10-K 33\n-competition with CRAs that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;\n-uncertainties in obtaining data and creating products and services relevant to particular geographic markets;\n-reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n-longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables;\n-differing accounting principles and standards;\n-difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including potential relocation and/or restaffing of employees as a result of Brexit;\n-difficulties and delays in translating documentation into foreign languages;\n-potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n-complexities of compliance with employment laws and new data and cybersecurity rules in numerous jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, Moody\u2019s is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as laws and regulations governing economic and trade sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, and anticorruption laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other similar local laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices the Company has implemented may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that the Company has violated sanctions, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company\u2019s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody\u2019s Operations are Exposed to Risks from Infrastructure Malfunctions or Failures.\nMoody\u2019s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which Moody\u2019s is located, including New York City, the location of Moody\u2019s headquarters, major cities worldwide in which Moody\u2019s has offices, and locations in China used for certain Moody\u2019s work. This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure (whether or not controlled by the Company), including the Company\u2019s electronic delivery systems, data center facilities, or the Internet, used by the Company or third parties with or through whom Moody\u2019s conducts business. Many of the Company\u2019s products and services are delivered electronically and the Company\u2019s customers depend on the Company\u2019s ability to receive, store, process, transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks. Some of Moody\u2019s operations require complex processes and the Company\u2019s extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations cannot eliminate such risk completely. The Company\u2019s customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of the Company\u2019s telecommunications, data centers, networks and other electronic delivery systems, including its websites and connections to the Internet. The Company\u2019s employees also depend on these systems for internal use. Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-breach, interruption or a significant slowdown of operations of the Company\u2019s infrastructure, whether due to human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, weather (including climate change), natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, pandemic (including the COVID-19 pandemic), war or otherwise, may impair the Company\u2019s ability to deliver its products and services.\nMoody\u2019s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. The Company relies on third-party providers, including, increasingly, cloud-based service providers, to provide certain essential services. While the Company believes that such providers are reliable, the Company has limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of the Company\u2019s third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the Company\u2019s needs and the needs of the Company\u2019s customers (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), the Company could experience lower revenues and higher costs. Additionally, although the Company maintains processes to prevent, detect and recover from a disruption, the Company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody\u2019s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons\u2019 ability to service and interact with Moody\u2019s customers will suffer. The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the Company\u2019s failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to Moody\u2019s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\n34 MOODY'S 2020 10-K\nChanges in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets, Asset Levels and Flows into Investment Levels and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Can Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company\u2019s Business.\nMoody\u2019s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets. Furthermore, issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional CRAs, such as MIS. A majority of Moody\u2019s credit-rating-based revenue is transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings. Changes to U.S. tax laws and policy can negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the U.S. For example, the Tax Act limits deductibility on interest payments and significantly reduces the tax cost associated with the repatriation of cash held outside the U.S., both of which could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued. Conditions that reduce issuers\u2019 ability or willingness to issue debt securities, such as market volatility, declining growth, currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which Moody\u2019s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees Moody\u2019s earns in its ratings business.\nEconomic and government factors such as a long-term continuation of difficult economic conditions, the scaling back, wind-down or termination of COVID-19 economic stimulus and support programs, and current uncertainty in various other jurisdictions, may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. Future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates, widening credit spreads, regulatory and political developments, growth in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. Declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody\u2019s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company\u2019s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, cost-reduction initiatives, including those under-taken to date, could make it difficult for the Company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings. Volatility in the financial markets, including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates, may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition, which the Company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions.\nThe Company Faces Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers.\nThere is price competition in the credit rating, research, and credit risk management markets, as well as in the market for research, business intelligence and analytical services offered by MA. Moody\u2019s faces competition globally from other CRAs and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research, as well as from in-house research operations. Competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from non-NRSROs that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors. At the same time, a challenging business environment and consolidation among both competitors and customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products and commercial real estate, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the Company\u2019s customer base. Weak economic growth intensifies competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers\u2019 use of free or lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources or their development of alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk that replace the products currently purchased from Moody\u2019s. While Moody\u2019s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services, it can lose market share when its pricing is not sufficiently competitive. In addition, the Reform Act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. The formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing and competitive pressures. Furthermore, in some of the countries in which Moody\u2019s operates, governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies. Any inability of Moody\u2019s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services will have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is Exposed to Reputation and Credibility Concerns.\nMoody\u2019s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. To the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or Moody\u2019s, relative to its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody\u2019s business will be significantly impacted. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in ratings, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process, including as to the Company\u2019s recent ESG initiatives, and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional, poor representation of our products and services by our partners or agents or unintentional misrepresentations of Moody\u2019s products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications. Operational errors, whether by Moody\u2019s or a Moody\u2019s competitor, could also harm the reputation of the Company or the credit rating industry. Damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition, as well as on the Company\u2019s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition.\nMOODY'S 2020 10-K 35\nThe Introduction of Competing Products, Technologies or Services by Other Companies Can Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, research, business intelligence and analytical services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer and investor demands, and evolving regulatory requirements, industry standards and market preferences. The ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products, technologies and services that anticipate customers\u2019 and investors\u2019 changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends in a timely and cost-effective manner is a key factor in maintaining market share. Moody\u2019s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody\u2019s, or may position, price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by Moody\u2019s. Moody\u2019s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers, some of whom are also suppliers to Moody\u2019s; these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with Moody\u2019s, cease doing business with Moody\u2019s or change the terms under which it does business with Moody\u2019s in a way that could negatively impact our business. In addition, customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody\u2019s products and services and its growth prospects. Further, the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for Moody\u2019s products and services. Moody\u2019s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by Moody\u2019s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors. Any inability of Moody\u2019s to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody\u2019s Is Exposed to Risks Related to Loss of Key Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures.\nMoody\u2019s success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody\u2019s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries. As greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, Moody\u2019s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than Moody\u2019s. Moody\u2019s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Additionally, relocation and/or restaffing of employees due to Brexit could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent for our European operations. There is a risk that even when the Company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be harmed.\nMoody\u2019s is highly dependent on the continued services of Robert Fauber, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior officers and key employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and Moody\u2019s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody\u2019s Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Strategic Transactions or Investments May Not Produce Anticipated Results Exposing the Company to Future Significant Impairment Charges Relating to Its Goodwill, Intangible Assets or Property and Equipment.\nMoody\u2019s regularly evaluates and enters into acquisition, disposition or other strategic transactions and investments to strengthen its business and grow the Company. For example, Moody\u2019s acquired Bureau van Dijk in 2017, Reis in 2018, and Regulatory DataCorp (RDC) in February 2020. Such transactions and investments present significant challenges and risks. The Company faces intense competition for acquisition targets, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect Moody\u2019s ability to complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, the Company makes significant investments in technology, including software for internal use, which can be expensive, time-intensive and complex to develop and implement.\n36 MOODY'S 2020 10-K\nAny strategic transaction involves a number of risks, including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations, technologies and new employees; the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the Company prior to closing a transaction; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities; failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; future developments that impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets; diversion of management\u2019s focus from other business operations; failure to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; disputes or litigation arising out of acquisitions or dispositions; challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business; coordination of product, sales, marketing and program and systems management functions; integration of employees from the acquired business into Moody\u2019s organization; integration of the acquired business\u2019s accounting, information technology, human resources, legal and other administrative systems with Moody\u2019s; risks that acquired systems expose us to cybersecurity risks; and for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction or investment may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions and investments to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2020, Moody\u2019s had $4,556 million of goodwill and $1,824 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet. Approximately 93% of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the MA business, including those related to Bureau van Dijk, and are allocated to the five reporting units within MA: Content; ERS; MALS; Bureau van Dijk; and Reis. The remaining 7% of goodwill and intangible assets reside in MIS and primarily relate to ICRA. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, and is having a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of many of our customers. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nOur operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, the global slowdown of economic activity and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences continue to be uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic\u2019s impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; uncertainty presented by approved vaccines, corresponding rollout and unanticipated consequences of such vaccine; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations and financial performance to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those discussed below:\n-The global credit market disruptions and economic stimulus measures led to robust U.S. investment grade and U.S. speculative grade issuance that may not continue as government programs are scaled back, wound down or terminated and as issuers reassess their capital position and liquidity needs.\n-We continue to publish research and issue credit ratings in accordance with our public credit rating methodologies in a highly uncertain, rapidly changing environment where it is difficult to predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the operations and financial performance of many of our rated issuers. Given these unprecedented events, and our prior experience during periods of volatility and economic uncertainty, it is likely that our ratings and research will be challenged around the globe by the press, rated entities, investors and government agencies and officials. Such scrutiny has impacted and may continue to impact our reputation, brand and credibility and result in future government and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries and litigation.\n-Likewise, MA continues to offer quantitative analytics in a highly uncertain, rapidly changing environment where it is difficult to accurately capture the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within its analytical models across different business sectors and geographies. Any failure of MA\u2019s models to sufficiently account for COVID-19 impacts may impact MA\u201ds reputation, brand and credibility and could result in customer dissatisfaction and/or contract cancellations.\nMOODY'S 2020 10-K 37\n-Illness, travel restrictions or workforce disruptions could result in reduced sales opportunities for both MIS and MA and result in an extension of the MA sales cycles on existing opportunities as well as higher attrition rates and/or lower yields on renewable contracts.\n-The COVID-19 pandemic may decrease demand for the financial intelligence and analytical tools MA provides, in particular in the event that MA\u2019s customers come under financial pressure and reduce spending for the types of products and services offered by MA.\n-Our customers are being impacted and will be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to differing degrees. Some of our customers may go out of business or lose access to market-based sources of capital, or experience significant spending constraints and layoffs, reducing the number of issuers in the market, issuance volume and demand for our products and services. As a result, we may face pricing pressure on our products, delayed renewals for certain subscription based products, and challenges to new sales which would in turn reduce revenue, ultimately impacting our results of operations.\n-The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility in the capital markets. The Company might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like, and our borrowing costs could increase.\n-While we have transitioned to remote work for all employees globally, maintaining such a state for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our productivity, our ability to meet the needs of our customers and may expose us to both operational and security risks. In addition, maintaining an infrastructure that supports a prolonged remote working environment may limit information technology resources available for other projects.\n-As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the global economy, it may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks, such as those surrounding cybersecurity, described in our risk factors in this Form 10-K. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results.\nC. Technology Risks\nThe Company is Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Protection of Confidential Information.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the Company\u2019s computer systems and networks, and in those of its third party vendors. The risks the Company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target the Company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to its ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of Moody\u2019s or Moody\u2019s vendors\u2019 technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company\u2019s or such vendors\u2019 web sites or systems, applications, data processing, or disruption of other business operations, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about Moody\u2019s business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Measures that Moody\u2019s takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective. Further, the Company may be exposed to additional threats as the Company migrates its data from legacy systems to cloud-based solutions, and increased dependence on third parties to store cloud-based data subjects the Company to further cyber risks.\n38 MOODY'S 2020 10-K\nThe Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, disaster plans, and technical defenses. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex, and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite the Company\u2019s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from, and has in the past experienced, security threats and system disruptions. Although past incidents have not had a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Because the methods used for these systems cyberattacks are rapidly changing, the Company, despite significant focus and investment, may be unable to anticipate/deploy sufficient protections against such incidents. Further, the extent of a particular security incident and the steps needed to investigate may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident, including the extent of the harm and how best to remediate it, is known. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity compliance requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Cybersecurity incidents, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, could cause reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. In addition, disclosure or media reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company\u2019s systems or those of the Company\u2019s third parties, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could lead to reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, or increased regulatory actions oversight and scrutiny.\nAny of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is Exposed to Risks Related Protection of Confidential Information\nTo conduct its operations, the Company regularly moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to Moody\u2019s is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union privacy law and added a broad array of requirements for processing personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. Additionally, other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. Further, laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, enacted in January 2020, will, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to consumers, and affords consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The effects of non-compliance with the CCPA and other similar data privacy laws in other jurisdictions are significant, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur additional costs and expenses. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements have required changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, requiring significant management time and attention, and subjecting the Company to negative publicity, as well as remedies that may harm its business, including fines, modified demands or orders. the cessation of existing business practices, and exposure to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties.\nThe Company Is Dependent on the Use of Third-Party Software, Data, Hosted Solutions, Data Centers, Cloud and Network Infrastructure (Together, \u201cThird Party Technology\u201d), and Any Reduction in Third-Party Product Quality or Service Offerings, Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations.\nMoody\u2019s relies on Third Party Technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations. The Company depends on the ability of Third Party Technology providers to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, provide data necessary to develop and maintain its products and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. The Third Party Technology Moody\u2019s uses can become obsolete or restrictive, incompatible with future versions of the Company\u2019s products, fail to be comprehensive or accurate, unavailable or fail to operate effectively (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), and Moody\u2019s business could be adversely affected when the Company is unable to timely or effectively replace such Third Party Technology.\nThe Company also monitors its use of Third Party Technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the Company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit Moody\u2019s use in the future, resulting in increased Third Party Technology acquisition costs and loss of rights. In addition, the Company\u2019s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for Third Party Technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to Third Party Technology are substantial. In the ordinary course, our third-parties, including our vendors, are subject to various forms of cyber attacks. To date, such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Some of these third-party suppliers are also Moody\u2019s competitors, increasing the risks noted above. When any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMOODY'S 2020 10-K 39", "PERMNO": 48506, "SIC": 7323, "TIC": "MCO"}
