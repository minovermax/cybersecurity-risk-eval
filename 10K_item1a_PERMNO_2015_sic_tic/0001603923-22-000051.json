{"cik": "1603923", "company": "Weatherford International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. You should consider carefully all the risk factors described below, the matters discussed herein under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K, were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and investors could lose part or all of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnergy Services Industry Risks\nOur business is dependent on capital spending by our customers which is greatly affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and the availability and cost of capital; reductions in capital spending by our customers has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for our services and products is tied to the level of exploration, development and production activity and the corresponding capital and operating spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, including national oil companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical and economic conditions. Low oil and natural gas prices and declines in global demand for oil and natural gas, including reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have previously led to our customers, including large oil and gas exploration and production companies, to greatly reduce planned future capital expenditures. Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include, but are not limited to: (1) the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas; (2) the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and the expanded alliance (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) and other high oil exporting non-OPEC+ nations to set and maintain oil production levels; (3) the level of oil and natural gas production in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC+ countries; (4) oil refining capacity; (5) shifts in end-customer preferences toward sustainable energy sources, fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; (6) the cost of, and constraints associated with, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; (7) governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves; (8) weather conditions, natural disasters, and health or similar issues, such as pandemics or epidemics; (9) worldwide political, military, and economic conditions; and (10) increased demand for alternative energy and electric vehicles, including government initiatives to promote the use of sustainable, renewable energy sources and public sentiment around alternatives to oil and gas.\nIn addition, actual and anticipated declines in commodity prices, the short-term tenor of most of our contracts and the financial stress experienced by some of our customers have combined to increase the demands by many of our customers for reductions in the prices we receive for our products and services in the past. Reductions in capital spending or requests for further cost reductions by our customers could directly impact our business by reducing demand and pricing for our services and products which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Spending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets, which have been volatile in recent years. Limitations on the availability of capital or higher costs of capital may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets even if oil and natural gas prices increase from current levels. In addition, the transition of the global energy sector from primarily a fossil fuel-based system to renewable energy sources could affect our customers' levels of expenditures. Any such cuts in spending would curtail drilling programs, as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change, environmental, social and governance and sustainability initiatives may result in regulatory or structural industry changes that then further results in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business, results of operations, stock price or access to capital markets.\nClimate change, environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) and sustainability are a growing global movement. Continuing political and social attention to these issues has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation, regulatory measures and policy changes. Also, there is increasing societal pressure in some areas, to limit greenhouse gas emissions and in the U.S., is a stated priority of the Biden Administration, as well as other global initiatives. These agreements and measures, including the Paris Climate Accord, may require, or could result in future legislation,\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 10\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nregulatory measures and policy changes that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. As a result of heightened public awareness and attention to these issues as well as continued regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of oil and gas, demand for hydrocarbons may be reduced, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business.\nCertain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in financing of conventional energy-related activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our customer\u2019s businesses or our own business. Increasing attention to climate change, ESG and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on the price of our securities and our access to and costs of capital.\nAny or all of these ESG and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and services, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, stock price or access to capital markets.\nFailure to effectively and timely address the need to operate more sustainably and with a lower carbon footprint and impact could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur long-term success may depend on our ability to effectively lower the carbon impact of how we deliver our products and services to our customers as well as adapting our technology portfolio for potentially changing government requirements and customer preferences towards more sustainable competitors. We must also consider engaging with our customers to develop solutions to decarbonize their oil and gas operations. If we fail or are perceived to not be effectively lowering our carbon impact, then we could potentially lose engagement with customers, investors and/or certain financial institutions.\nFailure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to effectively participate in the energy transition, which will require adapting our technology portfolio to potentially changing market demand for services and products to support the production of energy from sources other than hydrocarbons (e.g., geothermal, carbon capture, responsible abandonment, wind, solar and hydrogen). If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies focused primarily or solely in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted.\nSevere weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with global climate change, has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business has been, and in the future will likely be, affected by severe weather in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. In addition, impacts of climate change could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions. Any such extreme weather-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 11\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nLiability claims resulting from catastrophic incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nDrilling for and producing hydrocarbons, and the associated products and services that we provide, include inherent dangers that may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Many of these events are outside our control. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment are located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and third parties, such as other service providers. At many sites, we depend on other companies and personnel to conduct drilling and other operations in accordance with appropriate safety standards. From time to time, personnel are injured or equipment or property is damaged or destroyed, as a result of accidents, failed equipment, faulty products or services, failure of safety measures, uncontained formation pressures or other dangers inherent in drilling for or producing oil and natural gas. Any of these events can be the result of human error. With increasing frequency, our products and services are deployed on more challenging prospects both onshore and offshore, where the occurrence of the types of events mentioned above can have an even more catastrophic impact on people, equipment or the environment. Such events may expose us to significant potential losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly weakened demand for our products and services and has had a substantial negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus, have resulted in a significant reduction in international and U.S. economic activity and we have not yet reached pre-pandemic activity levels. These effects materially adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as for our services and products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted our business and our industry in 2020 and 2021. These effects included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, exacerbated, and could continue to exacerbate, the potential negative impact from many of the other risks we face. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have a considerable and detrimental effect on our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider as significant risks to our operations.\nGiven the nature and significance of the events described above, we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business and operations; however, we believe that in addition to the impacts described above, other current and potential impacts of these recent events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression;\n\u2022Reduction of our global workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022Infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers and other third parties in areas in which we operate;\n\u2022Our insurance policies may not cover losses associated with pandemics like COVID-19 or similar global health threats;\n\u2022Litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employment matters, personal injury and insurance arrangements; and\n\u2022Cybersecurity issues, as our reliance on digital technologies increases, those digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity due to stay-at-home orders.\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 12\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nOur fulfillment system relies on external suppliers and service providers. Shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase a variety of raw materials, as well as, parts and components made by other manufacturers and suppliers for use in our manufacturing facilities. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of materials could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Also, certain parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases may be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operational and financial growth is dependent on our liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, as well as service our debt, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand; (ii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations; and (iii) our ability to access the capital markets; and (iv) changes in market conditions that negatively impact our revenue.\nThe energy industry faces negative sentiment in the capital markets which has impacted the ability of participants to access appropriate amounts of capital under suitable terms. This negative sentiment in the energy industry has not only impacted our customers in North America, it is also affecting the availability and the pricing for most credit lines and other capital resources extended to participants in the industry.\nWe utilize letters of credit and performance and bid bonds to provide credit support to our customers. If the beneficiaries were to call the letters of credit issued under our committed and or uncommitted facilities, our available cash balance may be reduced by the amount called and it could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $342 million of letters of credit outstanding, consisting of $181 million under our senior secured letter of credit agreement (the \u201cLC Credit Agreement\u201d) and $161 million under various uncommitted facilities (of which there was $158 million in cash collateral held and recorded in \u201cRestricted Cash\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets). In Latin America, we utilize surety bonds as part of our customary business practice. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding surety bonds of $293 million. Any of our outstanding letters of credit or surety bonds could be called by the beneficiaries should we breach certain contractual or performance obligations. If the beneficiaries were to call the letters of credit under the LC Credit Agreement or the surety bonds, our available liquidity would be reduced by the amount called.\nWe may not be fully indemnified against financial losses in all circumstances where damage to or loss of property, personal injury, death or environmental harm occur.\nAs is customary in our industry, our contracts typically require that our customers indemnify us for claims arising from the injury or death of their employees (and those of their other contractors), the loss or damage of their equipment (and that of their other contractors), damage to the well or reservoir and environmental impacts originating from the customer\u2019s equipment or from the reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir) and claims arising from catastrophic events, such as a well blowout, fire, explosion and from environmental impacts below the surface. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for claims arising from the injury or death of our employees, the loss or damage of our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole) or environmental impacts originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth or water.\nOur indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, our indemnity arrangements may be held to be overly broad in some courts and/or contrary to public policy in some jurisdictions, and to that extent may be unenforceable. Additionally, some jurisdictions which permit indemnification nonetheless limit its scope by applicable law, rule, order or statute. We may be subject to claims brought by third parties or government agencies with respect to which we are not indemnified. Furthermore, the parties from which we seek indemnity may not be solvent, may become bankrupt, may lack resources or insurance to honor their indemnities or may not otherwise be able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us. The lack of enforceable indemnification could expose us to significant potential losses.\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 13\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nFurther, our assets generally are not insured against loss from political violence such as war, terrorism or civil unrest. If any of our assets are damaged or destroyed as a result of an uninsured cause, we could recognize a loss of those assets.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2.4 billion of long-term debt with $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11.0% Senior Notes maturing on December 1, 2024 (\u201cExit Notes\u201d) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Secured Notes maturing on September 15, 2028 (\u201c2028 Senior Secured Notes\u201d) and $1.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 8.625% Senior Notes maturing on April 30, 2030 (\u201c2030 Senior Notes\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of our Exit Notes, 2028 Senior Secured Notes and 2030 Senior Notes, we expect to make $215 million in interest payments in 2022 and approximately $204 million in interest payments annually until the maturity of our long-term debt obligations. If business activity declines, or otherwise does not increase, our level of indebtedness could have negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, or refinance, on terms that are commercially acceptable;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our free cash flow and the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors or competitors that may have better access to capital resources; and\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In the past, lower commodity prices and in turn lower demand for our products and services have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and low oil and natural gas prices could have an adverse effect on our liquidity position. Any harm to our business and operations resulting from our current or future level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to pay amounts due to our lenders and noteholders.\nOur business may be exposed to uninsured claims and, as a result, litigation might result in significant potential losses. The cost of our insured risk management program may increase.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims and litigation. We maintain liability insurance, which includes insurance against damage to people, property and the environment, in commercially reasonable amounts, subject to self-insured retentions and deductibles.\nOur insurance policies are subject to exclusions, limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases, for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged. It is possible an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring, and in some cases those potential losses could be material.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or our insurance may not cover all losses. For example, although we maintain product liability insurance, this type of insurance is limited in coverage and it is possible an adverse claim could arise in excess of our coverage. Additionally, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and may be unavailable on terms that we or our customers believe are economically acceptable. Reductions in coverage, changes in the insurance markets and accidents affecting our industry may result in further increases in our cost and higher deductibles and retentions in future years and may also result in reduced activity levels in certain markets. As a result, we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 14\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our operations outside the United States, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the 75 countries in which we operate.\nOur non-United States operations accounted for approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue in 2021. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022volatility in political, social and economic conditions including currency exchange controls, inflation, and currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u2022exposure to expropriation of our assets, deprivation of contract rights or other governmental actions;\n\u2022social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;\n\u2022fraud and political corruption;\n\u2022varying international laws and regulations;\n\u2022adequate responses to COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions;\n\u2022confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u2022trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other countries;\n\u2022exposure under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation; and\n\u2022restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby and the implementation of Fresh Start Accounting.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start Accounting and adjusted our assets and liabilities to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero as of December 13, 2019, which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from bankruptcy will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our pre-December 13, 2019 historical financial statements. Implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby materially changed the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements. The lack of recent comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our ordinary shares or debt securities or providing credit or financing on commercially acceptable terms to the Company.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant shareholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\nIn the aggregate, certain funds associated with our six largest shareholders currently own in excess of 68% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares. Circumstances may arise in which these shareholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional equity or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or could be in conflict with the interest of our other shareholders. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our securities because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning securities in companies with significant shareholders and may restrict the trading volume in our ordinary shares.\nAn active trading market for our ordinary shares may not continue and the price and trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly.\nOn June 1, 2021, NASDAQ approved our application for the listing of our ordinary shares. In connection with the listing, we became subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our ordinary shares began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 2, 2021 under the ticker symbol \u201cWFRD\u201d. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to a continued active trading market or how liquid that market will be. If an active trading market does not continue, holders of our shares may have difficulty selling any of our ordinary shares that may now be owned or may be purchased later.\nEven if an active trading market continues for our ordinary shares, the market price of our ordinary shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares may prevent one from being able to sell shares at or above the ordinary share issuance price or above the price one paid to acquire the ordinary shares.\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 15\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe LC Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our Exit Notes, 2028 Senior Secured Notes and 2030 Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that we may believe to be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022make loans and investments; and\n\u2022sell assets and incur liens.\nThese covenants and other restrictions may limit our ability to effectively operate our business, and to execute our growth strategy or take advantage of new business opportunities. These covenants and restrictions include minimum liquidity covenants, certain financial ratios, which may apply in certain circumstances, and other restrictions. Our ability to meet the liquidity thresholds and those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants and other restrictions under the LC Credit Agreement, the indentures governing our Exit Notes, 2028 Senior Secured Notes and 2030 Senior Notes or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default thereunder. Such a default may allow the lenders, holders or the trustee, as applicable, to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under LC Credit Agreements would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including treaties and international agreements related to greenhouse gases, climate change and renewable energy sources that may expose us to significant liabilities, result in additional compliance costs and could reduce our business opportunities and revenues.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to the energy industry related to pollution, protection of the environment and natural resources, public and worker health and safety, and treaties and international agreements related to climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gasses. These laws and regulations sometimes provide for strict liability for remediation costs, damages to natural resources, or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault. Some environmental laws also provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others. Thus, an environmental claim could arise with respect to one or more of our current businesses, operations, products or services, or a business or property that one of our predecessors owned or used, and such claims could involve material expenditures. Generally, environmental laws have in recent years become more stringent and have sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties and have required increased costs to comply with their requirements. The scope of regulation of our industry and our products and services may increase further, including possible increases in liabilities, financial assurance, or funding requirements imposed by governmental agencies. Additional regulations on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere in the world could be imposed, and those regulations could limit our business where they are imposed.\nIn addition, members of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various agencies of several states within the U.S. frequently review, consider and propose more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. We previously provided (and may, in the future, resume providing) fracturing services to customers. Regulators periodically investigate whether any chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process might adversely affect groundwater or whether the fracturing processes could lead to other unintended effects or damages. In recent years, local and national governments (including several cities and states within the U.S.) passed new laws and regulations restricting or banning hydraulic fracturing. A significant portion of North American service activity today is directed at prospects that require hydraulic fracturing in order to produce hydrocarbons. Therefore, additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business by subjecting fracturing to more stringent regulation. Regulation of hydraulic fracturing could increase our cost of providing services or materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if customers decrease their levels of activity or we cannot pass along cost to customers. We are unable to predict whether changes in laws or\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 16\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nregulations or any other governmental proposals or responses will ultimately occur, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.\nAdverse changes in tax laws both in the United States and abroad, changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could significantly increase our tax expense and require us to take actions, at potential significant expense, to seek to preserve our current level of tax expense.\nIn 2002, we reorganized from the United States to a foreign jurisdiction. There are frequent legislative proposals in the United States that attempt to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to United States subsidiaries of these corporations. Our tax expense could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, acting in unison or separately. The inability to reduce our tax expense could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), which represents a coalition of member countries, issued various white papers addressing Tax Base Erosion and Jurisdictional Profit Shifting. The recommendations in these white papers are generally aimed at combating what they believe is tax avoidance. Numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have been influenced by these white papers as well as other factors and are increasingly active in evaluating changes to their tax laws. In addition, the OECD has advanced reforms focused on global profit allocation, and implementing a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational corporations on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, known as the \u201ctwo pillar plan.\u201d On October 8, 2021, the OECD announced an accord endorsing and providing an implementation plan for the two pillar plan agreed upon by 136 nations. While the implementation of the accord is uncertain, if legislation is enacted to implement the accord in some or all of the jurisdictions in which we have operations, it could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe, on a retroactive or prospective basis, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and our cash flows from operations.\nOur effective tax rate has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries in which we operate with differing tax rates, non-income-based taxes, changes in tax laws, or changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance may be required. We have recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our shares, such holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are now classified as \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes due to the expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules within a multinational corporate group. If a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our shares, such person may be treated as a \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d with respect to one or more of our controlled foreign corporation subsidiaries. In addition, if our shares are treated as owned more than 50% by United States shareholders, we would be treated as a controlled foreign corporation. A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income, as ordinary income, its pro rata share of \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income\u201d and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, whether or not we make any distributions to such United States shareholder. An individual United States shareholder generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation. A failure by a United States shareholder to comply with its reporting obligations may subject the United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may extend the statute of limitations with respect to the United States shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which such reporting was due. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations or whether any investor is a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporations. We also cannot guarantee that we will furnish to United States shareholders information that may be necessary for them to comply with the aforementioned obligations. United States investors should consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us. The risk of being subject to increased taxation may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 17\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nThe United States could treat Weatherford International plc (parent corporation) as a United States taxpayer under IRC Section 7874.\nFollowing the emergence from bankruptcy on December 13, 2019, Weatherford continues to operate under Weatherford International plc (\u201cPLC\u201d), an Irish tax resident. The IRS may, however, assert that PLC should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to IRC Section 7874. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation generally is classified as either a U.S. corporation or a foreign corporation by reference to the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because PLC is an Irish incorporated entity, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under these rules. IRC Section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under IRC Section 7874, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a foreign corporation) will nevertheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes when (i) the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the assets held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the U.S. corporation by acquiring the outstanding shares of the U.S. corporation), (ii) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 80% (or 60% in certain circumstances if the Third Country Rule applies) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation, and (iii) the foreign corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d does not have substantial business activities in the foreign corporation\u2019s country of organization or incorporation relative to such expanded affiliated group\u2019s worldwide activities. Although it is not free from doubt, we believe that as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization in 2019, PLC should not be treated as acquiring directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a U.S. corporation and, as a result, PLC is not expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation or otherwise subject to the adverse tax consequences of IRC Section 7874. The law and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under IRC Section 7874 are, however, unclear and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this conclusion. If it is determined that IRC Section 7874 is applicable, PLC would be a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the taxable year of Weatherford US consolidated group could end on or prior to the emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in additional adverse tax consequences. In addition, although PLC would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would generally also be considered an Irish tax resident for Irish tax and other non-U.S. tax purposes.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Irish law; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.\nWe are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive, and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.\nSimilarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.\nWeatherford International plc - 2021 Form 10-K | 18\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nGeneral Risks\nIf our long-lived assets and other assets are impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to our earnings.\nWe recognize impairments of long-lived assets when we determine the carrying amount of certain long-lived asset groups exceed their respective fair values. Our impairment assessment includes analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of our asset groups, which include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and right of use assets. Based on the uncertainty of forecasted revenue, forecasted operating margins, and discount rate assumptions used to estimate our asset groups\u2019 fair value, future reductions in our expected cash flows could cause a material non-cash impairment charge of long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cybersecurity incidents and other technology disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. These information systems are increasingly subject to sophisticated cybersecurity incidents such as unauthorized access to data and systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer, supplier and employee information), computer viruses, or other malicious code, phishing and cyberattacks, and other similar events. These incidents arise from numerous sources, not all of which are within our control, including fraud or malice on the part of third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, human error, complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity incidents or attacks will be sufficient in preventing all such incidents or attacks, or be able to avoid a material impact to our systems should such incidents or attacks occur. Recent widespread ransomware attacks and cybersecurity breaches in the U.S. and elsewhere have affected many companies, including the cybersecurity incident involving SolarWinds Orion in December 2020. While these attacks did not affect our business operations, future events of this kind could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer, supplier or employee information, theft or loss of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers, suppliers and the market, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft or exposure to litigation, damage to equipment (which could cause environmental or safety issues) and other financial costs and losses. Moreover, although Weatherford implements stringent controls on third party connectivity to our systems, we have limited control in ensuring their systems consistently enforce strong cybersecurity controls. As a result, the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident or attack could go unnoticed for a period time. As cybersecurity incidents and attacks continue to evolve, we may also be required to devote additional resources to continue to enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We maintain insurance coverage to protect against certain cybersecurity risks. However, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cybersecurity incident or attack. Any cybersecurity incident or attack could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 32791, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "WFTLF"}
