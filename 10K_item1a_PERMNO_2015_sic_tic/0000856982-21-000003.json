{"cik": "856982", "company": "MERIT MEDICAL SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors.\nOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results will vary, and may vary materially, from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on our business, operations or financial condition are the factors identified below:\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business and operations around the world and may continue to materially and adversely impact our business, operations and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruption and uncertainty in the global economy, has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition, and we anticipate that it may continue to negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future.\nNumerous national, international, state and local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, a variety of government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders or restrictions may cause significant alteration of our operations, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions and event cancellations, among other effects, thereby significantly and negatively impacting our operations. Other disruptions or potential disruptions include (i) restrictions on our personnel and personnel of business partners to travel and access customers for training and case support\u037e (ii) reductions in spending by our customers; (iii) delays in approvals by regulatory bodies\u037e (iv) diversion of or limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the operations of our business, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people\u037e (v) reductions in our sales team, including through layoffs, furloughs or other losses of sales representatives\u037e (vi) additional government requirements or other incremental mitigation efforts that may further impact our or our suppliers' capacity to manufacture our products; (vii) disruption of our research and development activities; and (viii) delays in ongoing studies and pre-clinical trials.\nIn addition, elective procedures that use our products significantly decreased in number during 2020 as health care organizations around the world prioritized the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and reduced spending in other areas. For example, in the United States, governmental authorities have recommended, and in certain cases required, that elective, deferrable, specialty and other procedures and appointments, be suspended or canceled to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Specifically, many of these procedures that use our products have been suspended or postponed. While certain of these procedures have resumed in certain locations, it is unclear when or if all procedures in all locations will resume.\nWhile we have seen increases in demand for certain product lines during the pandemic, including our Cultura\u2122 nasopharyngeal swab and test kit, this increased demand has not been, and may not be, sufficient to offset the revenue declines in other areas. We also expect continued pressure on our margins due to decreased demand for products with gross margins that are higher than the company average.\nIn addition, most of the hospitals and clinics that purchase our products have instituted strict procedures at their facilities in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on sales representatives entering these facilities. This has been, and currently remains, a major impediment to our sales efforts, as supporting existing customers and acquiring new customers is much more difficult in this environment. These restrictions have had a significant adverse effect on our sales and, until they are lifted, our business, operations and financial results will continue to be adversely impacted.\nFurther, once the pandemic subsides, we anticipate there will be substantial backlog of patients seeking appointments with physicians and surgeries to be performed at hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers relating to a variety of medical conditions, and as a result, patients seeking procedures that use our products will have to navigate limited provider capacity. On the other hand, we do not know if demand for these postponed, elective procedures will return to the levels we experienced prior to the pandemic. We believe this limited provider, hospital and ambulatory surgery center capacity,\nand a decline in demand for the procedures that use our products, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results following the end of the pandemic.\nThese challenges and restrictions will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and may even continue beyond the pandemic. Many areas are relaxing restrictions and resuming business operations, but a resurgence in infections or mutations of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 could cause authorities to reinstate such restrictions or impose additional restrictions. All of these factors also may cause or contribute to disruptions and delays in our logistics and supply chain. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and spread of the virus and the actions by government entities, our customers and other parties to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, operations and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described herein, such as those relating to general economic conditions, demand for our products, relationships with suppliers and sales efforts.\nBusiness, Economic, Industry and Operational Risks\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. In recent years, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including the replacement of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) which became effective on July 1, 2020. At this time, it is unknown whether the current administration will attempt to renegotiate the terms of the USMCA or implement its own policies and regulations to replace those established by the Trump Administration. In addition, with changes in the balance of power between the parties in the U.S. Congress, new legislation could be passed into law. It is unclear what the effect of any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry or our Company. If any new legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, it may be inefficient and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes.\nIn addition, any changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, such as China, resulting in a \u201ctrade war.\u201d A trade war could result in increased costs for raw materials we use in our manufacturing and could result in foreign governments imposing tariffs on products that we export outside the U.S. or otherwise limiting our ability to sell our products abroad. Furthermore, regulations and trade policies implemented by foreign governments to reduce the costs of healthcare or promote business in their countries could also cause our sales to decline in such countries. For example, China has implemented a volume-based procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products. These events could result in increased costs, lower margins and lower sales than we would otherwise expect, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our customers and suppliers may also be affected by these events, so even if we are not directly impacted, we may still experience lower demand for our products and increases in our manufacturing costs because of the effects these events may have on our customers and suppliers.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cUK\u201d) departure from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d) has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the UK, the EU and a number of other countries, including with respect to compliance with the regulatory regimes regarding the labeling and registration of the products we sell in these markets. While we have taken proactive steps to mitigate possible disruption to our operations, we could face increased costs, volatility in exchange rates, market instability and other risks, depending on the effects of existing and future agreements between the UK and EU regarding Brexit and the future EU/UK trading relationship.\nThe above factors, including a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the U.S. and abroad, could ultimately have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the following :\n\u25cf a global or regional economic slowdown in any of our market segments;\n\u25cf postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors;\n\u25cf effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures;\n\u25cf rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation;\n\u25cf changes in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers;\n\u25cf industrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether;\n\u25cf difficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u25cf new or stricter trade policies and tariffs enacted by countries, such as China, in response to changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u25cf the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry, group purchasing organizations and public procurement policies have lead to demands for price concessions, which reduces our revenues and may harm our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, which has resulted in or led to numerous cost reform initiatives by legislators, regulators and third-party payers. Cost reform has triggered a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power, which has created more requests for pricing concessions and is expected to continue in the future. Additionally, many of our customers belong to group purchasing organizations or integrated delivery networks that use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for these hospitals and healthcare service providers. These customers are often able to obtain lower prices and more favorable terms because of the potential sales volume they represent, which has lead to lower revenues and required us to take on additional liability. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry worldwide, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products.\nTermination or interruption of, or a failure to monitor, our supply relationships and increases in labor costs and the price of our component parts, finished products, third-party services or raw materials, particularly petroleum-based products, could have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe rely on raw materials, component parts, finished products and third-party services in connection with our business. For example, substantially all of our products are sterilized by only a few different entities. If any of these sterilizers goes out of business or fails to comply with quality or regulatory requirements, we may be unable to find a suitable supplier to replace them. This could significantly delay or stop production and cause sales of such products to materially decline. Additionally, many of our products have components that are manufactured using resins, plastics and other petroleum-based materials which are available from a limited number of suppliers. We are experiencing a growing trend among suppliers of polymer resins to refuse to supply resin to the medical device manufacturers or to require such manufacturers to assume additional risks due to the potential for product liability claims. Additionally, there is no assurance that crude oil supplies will be uninterrupted or that petroleum-based manufacturing materials will be available for purchase in the future. Any interruption to the supply of polymers or petroleum-based resins could have an adverse effect on our ability to produce, or on the cost to produce, our products.\nThe availability and price of these materials, parts, products and services are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including the willingness of suppliers to sell into the medical device industry, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel-related transportation costs, liability concerns, climate change (including new and existing laws and regulations to address climate change), competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates and political uncertainty around the world. Our suppliers often pass some of their cost increases on to us, and if such increased costs are sustained or increase further, our suppliers may pass further cost increases on to us. In addition to the effect on resin prices, transportation costs generally increase based on the effect of higher crude oil prices, and these increased transportation costs are often passed on to us. Our costs may also be impacted by laws to increase minimum wages, including the potential increase to the federal minimum wage in the United States that has been recently proposed by the current administration.\nOur ability to recover such increased costs may depend upon our ability to raise prices on our products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of our customers and third-party payers, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or we experience terminations or interruption of our relationships with our suppliers, we could experience lower margins and profitability, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nAny damage or interruption to our facilities, infrastructure, manufacturing processes or information technology systems, or those of our suppliers, could result in lost revenues and our business could be seriously harmed.\nDamage or interruption to our facilities or systems relating to manufacturing, distribution, research and development, or information technology because of fire, extreme weather conditions, natural disaster, power loss, communications failure, geopolitical disruption, labor strikes, riots, cyber-attack, health epidemics and pandemics, unauthorized entry or other events could significantly disrupt our operations, the operations of suppliers and critical infrastructure. These events may also delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace the damaged facilities or systems. We have recently closed certain facilities, and the resulting consolidation may further exacerbate the effects of these events or make it more difficult for us to respond to the effects of these events. Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and, consequently, risks to our operations and growth. Although we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance coverage on our facilities, our insurance might not cover all losses under such circumstances, and we may not be able to renew or obtain such insurance in the future on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs.\nWe may be unable to compete in our markets, particularly if there is a significant change in relevant practices or technology.\nThe markets in which our products compete are highly competitive. We face competition from many companies which are larger, better established, have greater financial, technical and other resources and possess a greater market presence than we do. Such resources and market presence may enable our competitors to more effectively market competing products or to market competing products at reduced prices in order to gain market share.\nIn addition, our ability to compete successfully is dependent, in part, upon our response to changes in technology and upon our efforts to develop and market new products which achieve significant market acceptance. Competing companies with substantially greater resources than us are actively engaged in research and development of new methods, treatments, drugs, and procedures to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease that could limit the market for our products and eventually make some of our products obsolete. A reduction in the demand for a significant number of our products, or a few key products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nStrategic, Business Development and Employee Attraction and Retention Risks\nWe may be unable to successfully manage growth and maintain operational efficiencies.\nSuccessful implementation and execution of our business strategy will require that we effectively manage our growth. As the Company grows, we are often faced with decisions to (i) expand certain product lines and discontinue others, (ii) open or expand new facilities and close others, (iii) allocate resources between new and established markets, or (iv) allocate resources between the expansion of organic business and the acquisition of new product lines. The outcome of each choice in these decisions is uncertain, and even with the exercise of excellent business judgment, results may not align with expectations because of the many factors listed in this section. In addition, our management will need to continue to implement changes in certain aspects of our business, improve our information systems, infrastructure and operations to respond to increased demand, attract and retain qualified personnel, and develop, train, and manage an increasing number of employees. We may not have the resources available to implement certain necessary changes, and as a result, growth may be delayed or we may not be able to take advantage of certain business opportunities. Growth has placed, and will likely continue to place, an increasing strain on our management, sales and other personnel, and on our financial, product design, marketing, distribution, technology and other resources. Any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nSubstantial costs are incurred when identifying, evaluating, negotiating and closing acquisitions, and failure to integrate acquired businesses may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nOver the past several years, we have completed a series of significant acquisitions and, in the future we may consider other potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, certain of which may also be significant. We have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, significant expenses in connection with negotiating and consummating various acquisition and other strategic transactions. As we grow through acquisitions, we face the additional challenges of integrating the operations, culture, information management systems and other characteristics of the acquired entity with our own, including sales models related to capital equipment. Our efforts to integrate acquisitions may be hampered by delays, the loss of certain employees, suppliers or customers, proceedings resulting from employment terminations, culture clashes, unbudgeted costs, and other issues, which may occur at levels that are more severe or prolonged than anticipated.\nAdditionally, past and future acquisitions may increase the risks of competition we face by, among other things, extending our operations into industry segments and product lines where we have few existing customers or qualified sales personnel and limited expertise. Further, as a result of certain acquisitions, we are selling capital equipment, in addition to our historical sales of disposable medical devices. The sale of capital equipment may create additional risks and potential liability, which may negatively affect our business, operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, we may not realize competitive advantages, synergies or other benefits anticipated in connection with any such acquisition or other transaction. If we do not adequately identify and value targets for, or manage issues related to, acquisitions and strategic transactions, such transactions may not produce the anticipated benefits and have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe will be required to expend significant resources for research, development, testing and regulatory approval or clearance of our products under development, and these products may not be developed successfully or approved for commercial use.\nMost of our products under development will require significant additional research, development, engineering and, in some cases, preclinical and clinical testing, as well as regulatory approval or clearance and a commitment of significant additional resources prior to their commercialization. It is possible that our products may not:\n\u25cf be developed successfully;\n\u25cf be proven safe or effective in clinical trials;\n\u25cf offer therapeutic or other improvements over current treatments and products;\n\u25cf meet applicable regulatory standards or receive regulatory approvals or clearances;\n\u25cf be capable of production in commercial quantities at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf be successfully marketed; or\n\u25cf be covered by private or public insurers.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and manage our inventory.\nTo ensure adequate supply, we must forecast our inventory needs and place orders with our suppliers based on estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors, including our failure to accurately manage our expansion strategy and customer acceptance of new products, product introductions by our competitors, an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products or for products of our competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions or regulatory matters and weakening of economic conditions, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs, which would impact our gross margin. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities may not be able to deliver products to meet our order requirements, which could damage our reputation and customer relationships.\nOur forecasts of customer demand and related decisions that we make about production levels may take into account potential opportunities created by regulatory issues, supply disruptions or other challenges experienced by our competitors.\nWe generally do not know the extent and cannot predict the duration of these challenges experienced by our competitors. As a result, our estimates about related increased demand for our products are inherently uncertain and subject to change. If our estimates incorrectly forecast the extent or duration of this increased demand, or the product types to which it relates, our revenues, margins and earnings could be adversely affected.\nWe lack direct sales and marketing capabilities in many countries and are dependent on our distributors for the commercialization of our products in these countries. If we are unable to maintain or establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to commercialize any of our products in those countries.\nWe have no or limited direct sales or marketing capabilities in some of the regions and countries in which our products are sold, including, among others, China, Japan, Russia and India. We have entered into distribution agreements with third parties to market and sell our products in those countries in which we do not have a direct sales force and in those countries in which we utilize a \u201cmodified direct\u201d sales approach. If we are unable to maintain or enter into such distribution arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products in certain countries. Moreover, to the extent that we enter into distribution arrangements with other companies, our revenues, if any, will depend on the terms of any such arrangements and the efforts of others. These efforts may turn out not to be sufficient and our third-party distributors may not effectively sell our products. In addition, although our contract terms require our distributors to comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products, including anti-competition, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, we may not be able to ensure proper compliance. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products in full compliance with applicable laws, our results of operations and business could be impacted.\nActions of activist shareholders, including a proxy contest, could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may contest, or seek changes that conflict with, our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nOn May 26, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Starboard Value and Opportunity Master Fund Ltd (\u201cStarboard\u201d). Starboard is a significant shareholder and had previously informed us that it intended to nominate up to seven individuals to stand for election as directors at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Pursuant to the agreement, Starboard agreed to withdraw its slate of directors and we agreed to nominate three new directors. These three directors were elected to our Board of Directors at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Additional terms of the agreement with Starboard can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on May 27, 2020.\nWhile our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our shareholders, including Starboard, and we welcome constructive input from all shareholders toward the shared goal of enhancing stakeholder value, activist campaigns that contest, or seek to change, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because: (i) responding to actions by activist shareholders could disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition; (ii) perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, cause concern in the minds of our employees and lead to the departure of critical employees, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and (iii) these types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nWe are dependent upon key personnel.\nOur success is dependent on key management personnel, including Fred P. Lampropoulos, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lampropoulos is not subject to any agreement prohibiting his departure, and we do not maintain key man life insurance on his life. The loss of Mr. Lampropoulos, or of certain other key management personnel, could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operations. Our success also depends on, among other factors, the successful recruitment and retention of key operating, manufacturing, sales and other personnel.\nIntellectual Property\nWe may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to remain competitive is dependent, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and prevent other companies from using our intellectual property to produce competing products. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of confidentiality and license agreements, and through registrations under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. However, these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Additionally, these measures may not prevent competitors from duplicating our products or gaining access to our proprietary information and technology. Third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise use our intellectual property without authorization, and we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property by consultants, vendors, former employees and current employees. Despite our efforts to restrict such unauthorized disclosure or use through nondisclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions, we may not be able to enforce these contractual provisions or we may incur substantial costs enforcing our legal rights.\nThird parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently or by designing around our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection for our intellectual property as the laws of the U.S. Further, no assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate or meaningful protection against competitors or against similar technologies. All of our patents will eventually expire and some of our patents, including patents protecting significant elements of our technology, will expire within the next several years.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending our intellectual property in countries throughout the world may be impractical and prohibitively expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such lawsuits that we might initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from our business. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protections, which makes it difficult to stop infringement. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable.\nThird parties claiming that we infringe their intellectual property rights could cause us to incur significant legal or licensing expenses and prevent us from selling our products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We may not be aware of whether our products do or will infringe existing or future patents or the intellectual property rights of others. Because of constant technological change in the medical device industry in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of such former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, distract management from day-to-day operations and harm our brand or reputation, which in turn could harm our business or results of operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to (i) stop selling our products, (ii) redesign our products, (iii) discontinue the use of related trademarks, technologies or designs, (iv) pay damages or indemnification obligations, or (v) enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and we may not be able to redesign applicable products in a way to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.\nRegulatory, Litigation, Tax and Legal Compliance Risks\nThe FDA regulatory clearance process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and the failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory clearances and approvals could prevent us from commercializing our products.\nBefore we can introduce a new device or a new use of or a claim for a cleared device in the U.S., we must generally obtain clearance from the FDA, unless an exemption from premarket review or an alternative procedure, such as a de novo risk-based classification or a humanitarian device exemption, applies. The FDA clearance and approval processes for medical devices are expensive, uncertain and time-consuming.\nWe may make changes to our cleared products without seeking additional clearances or approvals if we determine such clearances or approvals are not necessary and document the basis for that conclusion. However, the FDA may disagree with our determination or may require additional information, including clinical data, to be submitted before a determination is made, in which case we may be required to delay the introduction and marketing of our modified products, redesign our products, conduct clinical trials to support any modifications and pay significant regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, the FDA may not approve or clear our products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization.\nIn particular, we are currently conducting a large, multinational pivotal human clinical trial of the Wrapsody\u2122 Stent Graft. A successful outcome of this trial is required to obtain approval from the FDA and some international regulatory agencies. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for the Wrapsody\u2122 Stent Graft or any other products on a timely basis or at all. Further, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, regulatory clearances for any product enhancements or new products we develop would result in delayed or no realization of revenue from such product enhancements or new products and in substantial additional costs, which could decrease our profitability.\nIn addition, we are required to continue to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once we have obtained clearance or approval for a product. We cannot provide assurance that we will successfully maintain the clearances or approvals we have received or may receive in the future. The loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements, could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur products are generally subject to regulatory requirements in foreign countries in which we sell those products. We will be required to expend significant resources to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances of our products, and there may be delays and uncertainty in obtaining those approvals or clearances.\nIn order to sell our products in foreign countries, generally we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearances and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country-to-country.\nThe EU requires that manufacturers of medical devices obtain the right to affix the CE mark, for compliance with the MDD, to medical devices before selling them in member countries of the EU. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. In order to obtain the authorization to affix the CE mark to products, a manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes and products meet certain European quality standards.\nIn May 2017, the EU adopted the MDR, which will repeal and replace the MDD with effect from May 26, 2021. Under transitional provisions, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2021 may continue to be placed on the market for the remaining validity of the certificate, until May 26, 2024 at the latest. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the MDR may be placed on the market in the EU. The MDR includes increasingly stringent requirements in multiple areas, such as pre-market clinical evidence (some of which are now in effect), review of high-risk devices, labeling and post-market surveillance. Under the MDR, pre-market clinical data will now be required to obtain CE Mark approval for high-risk, new and modified medical\ndevices. We plan to be fully compliant with the MDR ahead of expiry dates, however for multiple reasons, including but not limited to changing business strategies, costs of obtaining MDR certification, availability of necessary data and Notified Body capacity, there may be some products that we will discontinue in the EU or which may not be fully compliant at the time of expiry.\nChina and some of its provinces have also implemented policies and regulations to reduce prices for medical devices, such as a volume-based procurement process. China-based companies may also have certain competitive advantages because of these policies and regulations.\nComplying with and obtaining regulatory approval in foreign countries, including compliance with the MDR when effective, have caused and will likely continue to cause us to experience more uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.\nThe medical device industry is subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and we are currently operating under a Corporate Integrity Agreement. If governmental authorities determine that we have violated laws, regulations or our Corporate Integrity Agreement, our company or our employees may be subject to various penalties, including civil or criminal penalties.\nOur medical devices and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities and domestic and foreign legislators continue to scrutinize the medical device industry. In recent years, the U.S. Congress, DOJ, the OIG and the Department of Defense, as well as foreign counterparts, have issued subpoenas and other requests for information to medical device manufacturers, primarily related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices.\nIn October 2020, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the DOJ to resolve their investigation into our past marketing transactions and practices. Under the Settlement Agreement and related agreements, we paid approximately $18.7 million (which includes interest and certain fees) in exchange for a release from liability for the alleged conduct. The settlement was also conditioned upon our entering into a CIA with the OIG, see \u201cRegulation - DOJ Settlement and Corporate Integrity Agreement\u201d in Item 1 of this report. Even if we fully comply with the CIA, we have incurred, and anticipate that we will continue to incur, substantial costs in connection with the settlement and compliance with the CIA. It is unclear what impact the settlement has had and may have on our reputation. This matter has consumed a significant amount of our resources and management\u2019s attention.\nWe anticipate that government authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by government authorities may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects on our operations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and the terms of the CIA, we may be subjected to a wide variety of sanctions and enforcement actions, including warning letters that require corrective action, injunctions, product seizures or recalls, suspension of product manufacturing, revocation of approvals, import or export prohibitions, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, civil fines and/or criminal penalties, which in turn may have a negative impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms.\nWe are subject to laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, the violation of which could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nOur operations are subject to various state and federal laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and other anti-kickback laws, which prohibit any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for an item or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of these fraud and abuse-related laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could harm our business or financial results. Allegations of such violations could lead to expensive and time-consuming investigations by government authorities and result in conviction\nof these violations or settlement costs and additional restrictions, like a CIA, as was the outcome of our DOJ investigation discussed above.\nWe are also subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from illegally offering things of value to any individual for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. As we continue to expand our business activities internationally, compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws presents greater challenges to our operations. If our employees or agents violate the provisions of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, we may incur fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nLimits on reimbursement imposed by governmental and other programs may adversely affect our business and results of operation.\nWe sell our products to hospitals and other healthcare providers around the world that typically receive reimbursement for the services provided to patients from third-party payers such as government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance programs. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for the cost of our products from governmental and private third-party payers is critical to our business. Limits on reimbursement imposed by such programs may adversely affect the ability of hospitals and others to purchase our products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThird-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In general, a third-party payer covers a medical procedure only when the plan administrator is satisfied that the product or procedure is reasonable and necessary to the patient\u2019s treatment; however, the cost-effectiveness of the treatment may also be a condition. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products can differ significantly from payer to payer. In addition, payers continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage or alter pre-authorization requirements for new or existing products and procedures. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in any efforts we may potentially undertake to reverse such non-coverage decisions. If we are not successful in reversing non-coverage policies, or if third-party payers that currently cover or reimburse certain procedures reverse or limit their coverage of such procedures in the future, or if other third-party payers issue similar policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions, such as additional preauthorization requirements, both in the U.S. and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products or any of our products in development for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S., state and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nThe U.S. and many other countries in which we conduct our operations have adopted laws and regulations protecting certain data, including medical and personal data (including HIPAA, the HITECH Act and the rules issued thereunder), and requiring data holders and controllers to implement administrative, logical and technical controls and procedures in order to protect the privacy of such data. Individual states have also begun to enact data privacy laws. For example, California\u2019s Consumer Protection Act went into effect on January 1, 2020, giving consumers the right to demand certain information and actions from companies who collect personal information. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws and regulations that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. In addition, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of additional proposals concerning data protection. These laws and regulations have been, and may continue to be, inconsistent with each other, requiring different approaches in different jurisdictions. In addition, the interpretation and application of medical and personal data protection laws and regulations in the U.S., Europe, China and elsewhere are\noften uncertain and in flux. Further, we have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, significant expense in connection with our efforts to comply with those applicable laws and regulations. It is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices, possibly resulting in fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nLegal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S. and other non-EU jurisdictions (in particular taking into account the recent decision of the European Court of Justice in Case C-311/18 (Schrems II)). For example, the GDPR, which came into application in the EU on May 25, 2018, applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users. The GDPR created a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).\nOur failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could affect our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe manufacture and assemble certain products that require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to various national, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety. Moreover, climate change and sustainability efforts and potential climate change regulations could lead to business interruption, significantly increased costs and other adverse consequences to our business. While the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically, compliance with future regulations may require additional capital investments. Additionally, because we use a limited amount of hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes, we are subject to certain risks of future liabilities, lawsuits and claims resulting from any substances we manufacture, dispose of or release. Certain environmental laws and regulations may impose \u201cstrict liability\u201d for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others, or for acts that were in non-compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed, rendering us liable without regard to our negligence or fault. Because of these laws, any accidental release may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nOur operations are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety, training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require significant expenditures.\nWe are also subject to corporate social responsibility, or CSR, laws and regulations which require us to monitor the labor standards in our supply chain, including the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the UK Modern Slavery Act, and U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations regarding Combating Trafficking in Persons. These CSR labor laws and regulations may impose additional processes and supplier management systems and have led certain key customers to impose additional requirements on medical device companies, including audits, as a prerequisite to selling products to such customers, which could result in increased costs for our products, the termination or suspension of certain suppliers, and reductions in our margins and profitability.\nUse of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.\nThe marketing clearances and approvals from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific uses. We are prohibited from marketing or promoting any uncleared or unapproved use of our product. However, physicians may use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval or clearance. The use of our products for unauthorized purposes could arise from our sales personnel or distributors violating our policies by providing information or recommendations about such unauthorized uses. Consequently, claims may be asserted by the FDA or other enforcement agencies that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or have improperly promoted our products for uncleared or unapproved uses. The FDA or such other agencies could require a recall of products or allege that our promotional activities misbrand or adulterate our\nproducts or violate other legal requirements, which could result in investigations, prosecutions, fines or other civil or criminal actions.\nOur products may be subject to product liability claims and warranty claims.\nOur products are used in connection with invasive procedures and in other medical contexts that entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. If medical personnel or their patients suffer injury or death in connection with the use of our products, whether as a result of a failure of our products to function as designed, an inappropriate design, inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or information, improper use, or for any other reason, we could be subject to lawsuits seeking significant compensatory and punitive damages. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class. We have previously faced claims by patients claiming injuries from our products. To date, these claims have not resulted in material harm to our operations or financial condition. The outcome of this type of personal injury litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. We maintain product liability insurance; however, there is no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any claim made against us. Moreover, any product liability claim brought against us could result in significant costs, divert our management\u2019s attention from other business matters or operations, increase our product liability insurance rates, or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. As a result, any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe generally offer a limited warranty for the return of product due to defects in quality and workmanship. We attempt to estimate our potential liability for future product returns and establish reserves on our financial statements in amounts that we believe will be sufficient to address our warranty obligations; however, our actual liability for product returns may significantly exceed the amount of our reserves. If we underestimate our potential liability for future product returns, or if unanticipated events result in returns that exceed our historical experience, our financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, the occurrence of such an event or claim could result in a recall of products from the market or a safety alert relating to such products. Such a recall could result in significant costs, reduce our revenue, divert management\u2019s attention from our business, and harm our reputation.\nOur products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA or other governmental authorities, and if we fail to do so, we may be subject to sanctions that may materially harm our business.\nOur products are subject to medical device reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA information that reasonably suggests one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or one of our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, this device or a similar device that we market would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Our obligation to report under the medical device reporting regulations is triggered on the date on which we become aware of information that reasonably suggests a reportable adverse event occurred. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or if the product characteristic that caused the adverse event is removed in time from our products. If we fail to comply with our medical device reporting obligations, the FDA could issue warning letters or untitled letters, take administrative actions, commence criminal prosecution, impose civil monetary penalties, demand or initiate a product recall, seize our products, or delay the clearance of our future products.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, manufacturers and distributors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, manufacturers and distributors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates healthcare laws and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and international authorities, manufacturing standards, and laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, and a global anti-corruption policy, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties.\nWe may be a party to litigation in the course of our business or otherwise, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims or other legal matters, arising in the course of our business. In particular, our company, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have been named in a complaint filed in the Central District of California, which alleges violations of certain federal securities laws. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although it is our intention to vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in significant compensatory damages or injunctive relief that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business, and a material disruption of critical information systems or a material breach in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.\nWe rely on information technology systems (including technology from third-party providers) to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information. We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious code, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurance that our protective measures have prevented or will prevent security breaches, any of which could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial condition, particularly attacks that result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed or stolen.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to supply and support certain aspects of our information technology systems. These third-party systems could also become vulnerable to cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference or other significant disruptions, and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. In addition, we continue to grow in part through business and product acquisitions and, as a result, may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in the systems operated by the other parties to those transactions, or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquired businesses and products into our information technology systems.\nCyber-attacks could also result in unauthorized access to our systems and products, including personal information of individuals, which could trigger notification requirements, encourage actions by regulatory bodies, result in adverse publicity, prompt us to offer credit support products or services to affected individuals and lead to class action or other civil litigation. If we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could (i) lose customers, (ii) be subject to fraud, (iii) breach our agreements with or duties toward customers, physicians, other health care professionals and employees, (iv) be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, (v) incur expenses or lose revenues, (vi) sustain damage to our reputation, or (vii) suffer other adverse consequences. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety, and product recalls or field actions. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nMarket, Liquidity and Credit Risks\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.\nOn July 31, 2019 we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\u201cThird Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and a lender, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, BOFA Securities, Inc., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, and U.S. Bank National Association as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association and U.S. Bank National Association as co-syndication agents. In addition, Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, U.S. Bank, National Association, BMO Harris Bank, N.A., and MUFG Union Bank, Ltd. are parties to the Third Amended Credit Agreement as lenders. The Third Amended Credit Agreement amends and restates in its entirety our previously outstanding Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and all amendments thereto (the \u201cSecond Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Third Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity or our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens or pledges on our assets, mergers or similar combinations or liquidations, asset dispositions, repurchases or redemptions of equity interests or debt, issuances of equity, payment of dividends and certain distributions and entry into related party transactions.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral for the Third Amended Credit Agreement. Our breach of any covenant in the Third Amended Credit Agreement, not otherwise cured, waived or amended, could result in a default under that agreement and could trigger acceleration of the underlying obligations. Any default under the Third Amended Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations. The administrative agent, joint lead arrangers, joint bookrunners and lenders under the Third Amended Credit Agreement have available to them the remedies typically available to lenders and secured parties, including the ability to foreclose on the collateral we have pledged. It could lead to an acceleration of indebtedness and foreclosure on our assets.\nAs currently amended, the Third Amended Credit Agreement provides for potential borrowings of up to $750 million. Such increased borrowing limits may make it more difficult for us to comply with leverage ratios and other restrictive covenants in the Third Amended Credit Agreement. We may also have less cash available for operations and investments in our business, as we will be required to use additional cash to satisfy the minimum payment obligations associated with this increased indebtedness.\nWe depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.\nWe are dependent on our cash on hand and free cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations. Our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service or repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has recently been, and may in the future be, volatile for various reasons, including those discussed in these risk factors. Other events that could cause volatility in our stock, include without limitation, variances in our financial results; analysts\u2019 and other projections or recommendations regarding our common stock specifically or medical technology stocks generally; any restatement of our financial statements or any investigation of us by the SEC, DOJ, OIG, FDA, or another regulatory authority; significant litigation or a decline, or rise, of stock prices in capital markets generally.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results.\nAs our operations have grown outside the U.S., we have also become increasingly subject to market risk relating to foreign currency. Those fluctuations could have a negative impact on our margins and financial results. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the exchange rate between all applicable foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar resulted in a decrease in net sales of\napproximately $1.3 million, a decrease of approximately $13.5 million and an increase of approximately $5.2 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $323.8 million, or 33.6%, of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies, with our CNY- and Euro-denominated sales representing our largest currency risks to net sales. If the rate of exchange between foreign currencies declines against the U.S. Dollar, we may not be able to increase the prices we charge our customers for products whose prices are denominated in those respective foreign currencies. Furthermore, we may be unable or elect not to enter into hedging transactions which could mitigate the effect of declining exchange rates. As a result, if the rate of exchange between foreign currencies declines against the U.S. Dollar, our financial results may be negatively impacted.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nWe are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation method and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the interest rates under our Third Amended Credit Agreement.\nCertain of the interest rates applicable to our Third Amended Credit Agreement, and applicable to hedging instruments we have purchased to offset interest rate risk under our Third Amended Credit Agreement, are LIBOR-based. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. Actions by the FCA, other regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the UK or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, including the floating rates applicable to our Third Amended Credit Agreement and related hedges. It is possible that the changes in how LIBOR is calculated, changes in the trading market for LIBOR-based securities or actions of the FCA and other government entities may cause unexpected increases in LIBOR rates or a breakdown in the LIBOR systems. If these issues arise, we could experience increased interest rates or uncertainty with respect to the calculation of interest on our Third Amended Credit Agreement and other instruments, which could harm our operations.", "PERMNO": 76392, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "MMSI"}
