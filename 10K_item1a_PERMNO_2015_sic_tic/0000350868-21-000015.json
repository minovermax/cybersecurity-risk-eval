{"cik": "350868", "company": "ITERIS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, some of which are discussed below. Other risks are presented elsewhere in this report and in the information incorporated by reference into this report. You should consider the following risks carefully in addition to the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, before deciding to buy, sell or hold our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Related to Our Business\nBecause we depend on government contracts and subcontracts, we face additional risks related to contracting with federal, state and local governments, including budgetary issues and fixed price contracts, that could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with governmental agencies, either as a general contractor, subcontractor or supplier. We anticipate that revenue from government contracts will continue to remain a significant portion of our revenues. Government business is, in general, subject to special risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022delays in funding and uncertainty regarding the allocation of funds to state and local agencies from the U.S. federal government, delays in the expenditures from the federal highway bill and delays or reductions in other state and local funding dedicated for transportation and ITS projects;\n\u2022other government budgetary constraints, cut-backs, delays or reallocation of government funding, including without limitation, changes in the administration and repeal of government purchasing programs;\n\u2022long purchase cycles or approval processes;\n\u2022competitive bidding and qualification requirements, as well as our ability to replace large contracts once they have been completed;\n\u2022changes in government policies and political agendas;\n\u2022maintenance of relationships with key government entities from whom a substantial portion of our revenue is derived;\n\u2022milestone deliverable requirements and liquidated damage and/or contract termination provisions for failure to meet contract milestone requirements;\n\u2022performance bond requirements;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions or other natural or medical disasters or developments, such as, the novel coronavirus COVID-19, and evacuations and flooding due to hurricanes, can result in our inability to perform work in affected areas; and\n\u2022international relations and international conflicts or other military operations that could cause the temporary or permanent diversion of government funding from transportation or other infrastructure projects.\nGovernmental budgets and plans are subject to change without warning. Certain risks of selling to governmental entities include dependence on appropriations and administrative allocation of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that may reflect political developments or agendas, significant changes in contract scheduling, intense competition for government business and termination of purchase decisions for the convenience of the governmental entity. Substantial delays in purchase decisions by governmental entities, and the current constraints on government budgets at the federal, state and local level, and the ongoing uncertainty as to the timing and accessibility to government funding could cause our revenues and income to drop substantially or to fluctuate significantly between fiscal periods.\nIn addition, a number of our government contracts are fixed price contracts. As a result, we may not be able to recover any cost overruns we may incur. These fixed price contracts require us to estimate the total project cost based on preliminary projections of the project's requirements. The financial viability of any given project depends in large part on our ability to estimate these costs accurately and complete the project on a timely basis. In the event our costs on these projects exceed the fixed contractual amount, we will be required to bear the excess costs. Such additional costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, certain of our government contracts are subject to termination or renegotiation at the convenience of the government, which could result in a large decline in our revenues in any given period. Our inability to address any of the foregoing concerns or the loss or renegotiation of any material government contract could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability could be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain adequate utilization of our Transportation Systems workforce.\nThe cost of providing our Transportation Systems engineering and specialized consulting services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and assimilate new employees;\n\u2022our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in our various regions;\n\u2022the timing of new contract awards, the commencement of work under an awarded contract or the completion of large contracts;\n\u2022availability of funding or other budget issues;\n\u2022our need to devote time and resources to training, business development, professional development and other non-chargeable activities; and\n\u2022our ability to match the skill sets of our employees to the needs of the marketplace.\nAn inability to properly and fully utilize our Transportation Systems workforce would reduce our profitability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur management information systems and databases have been and could in the future be disrupted by data protection breaches, system security failures, cyber threats or by the failure of, or lack of access to, our internal operations, such as our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system, or services provided to our customers. These disruptions could negatively impact our sales, increase our expenses, significantly harm our reputation and/or adversely affect our stock price.\nExperienced users and computer programmers may be able to penetrate, or \"hack\", our network security and create system disruptions, cause shutdowns and compromise or misappropriate our confidential information or that of our employees and third parties. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our internal network, any of our systems, service offerings or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our network, systems or service offerings. In addition, sophisticated services, hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of a system. We could incur expenses addressing problems created by cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful. We must, and do, take precautions to secure customer information and prevent unauthorized access to our databases and systems containing confidential information. Any data security event,\nsuch as a breach, data loss or information security lapses, whether resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of confidential, sensitive or classified information, could result in interruptions, cessation of service(s), claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us, loss of current and future contracts, adverse effects to results of operations and financial condition, serious harm to our reputation and/or adverse effects to our stock price. We operate our ERP system on a SaaS platform, and we use this system for reporting, planning, sales, audit, inventory control, loss prevention, purchase order management and business intelligence. Accordingly, we depend on this system, and the third-party provider of this service, for a number of aspects of our operations. If this service provider or this system fails, or if we are unable to continue to have access to this system on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, operations would be severely disrupted until an equivalent system could be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our operations. This disruption would have a material adverse effect on our business. We carry insurance, including cyber insurance, commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations, although there is no certainty that such insurance will in all cases be sufficient to fully reimburse us for all losses incurred in connection with the occurrence of any of these system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks or other events.\nIn April 2020, certain internal computer systems at our headquarters in Santa Ana were breached by an intruder, which prevented them temporarily from operating. We immediately took steps to isolate those systems and implemented measures to prevent additional systems from being affected, including taking systems offline as a precaution. The intrusion did not affect any customer-facing systems. Third party forensic experts were engaged to assist our information technology team to restore those affected internal systems to operation. We completed our investigation on June 3, 2020 and we have not experienced, nor do we believe there has been, any material impact to our operating activities nor our controls over financial reporting. To date, we have found no evidence of data exfiltration or misappropriation.\nIf unauthorized access is obtained to our customer's personal and/or proprietary data in connection with our web-based and mobile application solutions and services, we may suffer various negative impacts, including a loss of customer and market confidence, loss of customer loyalty, and significant liability to our customers and to individuals or businesses whose information was being stored.\nProtecting data of our customers is critical to our business, and if there is unauthorized access we may incur significant costs or liabilities. In addition, we are required to comply with government contracting requirements and make investments in our systems to protect that data. If we are unable to do so, our customers may lose confidence in us, which would harm our sales, and we may incur significant expenses or liabilities.\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID19 (\"the Pandemic\"). The Pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to this public health crisis, with mitigation measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines and \"stay-at-home\" orders. The uncertainties caused by the Pandemic include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, workplace dislocations, economic contraction, and downward pressure on some customer budgets and customer sentiment in general. The uncertainties caused by these events and actions include, but are not limited to, the adverse effect of the Pandemic on the economy, our vendors, our employees and customers and customer sentiment in general, such as supply chain disruptions, workplace dislocations, economic contraction, and downward pressure on some customer budgets and customer sentiment in general. . Continued impacts of the Pandemic have materially adversely impacted global economic conditions, and have impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition, such as expense reductions, in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The extent of the impact of the Pandemic on our business and financial results and volatility of our stock price will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak, the impact on capital and financial markets, the distribution, rate of adoption and efficacy of vaccines, and the related impact on the financial circumstances of our customers, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nAcquisitions of companies or technologies, including our acquisition of AGI and TrafficCast, may require us to undertake significant capital infusions and could result in disruptions of our business and diversion of resources and management attention.\nWe completed the acquisitions of AGI in July 2019 and TrafficCast in December 2020 and we plan to continue to explore acquiring additional complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies. Acquisitions may require significant capital infusions and, in general, acquisitions also involve a number of special risks, including:\n\u2022potential disruption of our ongoing business and the diversion of our resources and management's attention;\n\u2022the failure to retain or integrate key acquired personnel;\n\u2022the challenge of assimilating diverse business cultures, and the difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies and information system of the acquired companies;\n\u2022increased costs to improve managerial, operational, financial and administrative systems and to eliminate duplicative services;\n\u2022the incurrence of unforeseen obligations or liabilities;\n\u2022potential impairment of relationships with employees or customers as a result of changes in management; and\n\u2022increased interest expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as unanticipated accounting charges.\nOur competitors are also soliciting potential acquisition candidates, which could both increase the price of any acquisition targets and decrease the number of attractive companies available for acquisition. Acquisitions may also materially and adversely affect our operating results due to large write-offs, contingent liabilities, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges or intangible asset amortization, or other adverse tax or accounting consequences. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify or consummate any additional acquisitions, successfully integrate any acquisitions or realize the benefits and opportunities anticipated from any acquisition.\nAcquisitions, investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding potential strategic transactions. Effecting these strategic transactions could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. We face risks that include, among other things:\n\u2022the strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;\n\u2022strategic benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;\n\u2022our ability to realize the expected financial benefits of an acquisition, divestiture or other strategic transaction;\n\u2022cost reductions may not occur as expected;\n\u2022management time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022cultural challenges may arise associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022we may fail to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology.\nOur failure to address the risks and other issues in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits and opportunities, including unanticipated liabilities, increased costs, and harm our business generally.\nWe participate in the software development market, which may be subject to various technical and commercial challenges.\nWe have only been in the business of software development for a few years and have in the past and may in the future experience development and technical challenges. Our business and results of operations could also be seriously harmed by any significant delays in our software development activities. Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in our software after its release. Any faults or errors in our existing products or in any new products may cause delays in product introduction and shipments, require design modifications, or harm customer relationships or our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business and competitive position. In addition, software companies are subject to litigation concerning intellectual property disputes, which could be costly and distract our management.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards, we will not be able to remain competitive, and the demand for our products will likely decline.\nOur markets are in general characterized by the following factors:\n\u2022rapid technological advances;\n\u2022downward price pressures in our target markets as technologies mature;\n\u2022changes in customer requirements;\n\u2022additional qualification requirements related to new products or components;\n\u2022frequent new product introductions and enhancements;\n\u2022obsolescence of certain parts and components from time to time that may require re-engineering of certain portions of our product;\n\u2022inventory issues related to transition to new or enhanced models; and\n\u2022evolving industry standards and changes in the regulatory environment.\nOur future success will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, and to effectively develop, introduce, market and gain broad acceptance of new products and product enhancements incorporating the latest technological advancements.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a cost-effective and timely manner, or are unable to achieve market acceptance of our new products, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe believe our revenue growth and future operating results will depend on our ability to complete development of new products and enhancements, introduce these products in a timely, cost-effective manner, achieve broad market acceptance of these products and enhancements, and reduce our production costs. During the past few fiscal years, we have introduced, and will continue to introduce this fiscal year, both new and enhanced products across all segments. We cannot guarantee the success of these products, and we may not be able to introduce any new products or any enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, the introduction of any new products could adversely affect the sales of certain of our existing products.\nWe believe that we must continue to make substantial investments to support ongoing research and development in order to develop new or enhanced products and software to remain competitive. We need to continue to prepare updates for existing products and develop and introduce new products that incorporate the latest technological advancements in outdoor image processing hardware, camera technologies, software and analysis in response to evolving customer requirements. In addition, we are beginning to migrate some of our products to a new platform. We cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately manage product transition issues. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments or changing customer requirements or if we cannot adequately manage inventory issues typically related to new product transitions and introductions. We cannot assure you that any such investments in research and development will lead to any corresponding increase in revenue.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have historically experienced volatility in our earnings and cash flows from operations from year to year. Should the credit markets further tighten or our business decline, we may need or choose to raise additional capital to fund our operations, to repay indebtedness, pursue acquisitions or expand our operations. Such additional capital may be raised through bank borrowings, or other debt or equity financings. We cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, and such additional financing may result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022market acceptance of our products and product enhancements, and the overall level of sales of our products;\n\u2022our ability to control costs and achieve profitability;\n\u2022the supply of key components for our products;\n\u2022our ability to increase revenue and net income;\n\u2022increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses;\n\u2022our need to respond to technological advancements and our competitors' introductions of new products or technologies;\n\u2022capital improvements to new and existing facilities and enhancements to our infrastructure and systems;\n\u2022any acquisitions of businesses, technologies, product lines, or possible strategic transactions or dispositions;\n\u2022our relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u2022government budgets, political agendas and other funding issues, including potential delays in government contract awards or commencement of work for a project;\n\u2022our ability to successfully negotiate credit arrangements with our bank and the state of the financial markets in general; and\n\u2022general economic conditions, including the effects of the economic slowdowns and international conflicts.\nIf our capital requirements are materially different from those currently planned, we may need additional capital sooner than anticipated. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms when needed, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned, develop or enhance our products, expand our sales and marketing programs, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive with many companies more established than we are.\nWe compete with numerous other companies in our target markets including, but not limited to, large, multi-national corporations and many smaller regional engineering firms.\nWe compete with existing, well-established companies and technologies in our Roadway Sensors segment, both domestically and abroad. Only a portion of the traffic intersection market has adopted advanced above-ground detection technologies, and our future success will depend in part upon gaining broader market acceptance for such technologies. Certain technological barriers to entry make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market with competing video or other technologies; however, we are aware of new market entrants from time to time. Increased competition could result in loss of market share, price reductions and reduced gross margins, any of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Transportation Systems market is highly fragmented and is subject to evolving national and regional quality and safety standards. Our competitors vary in size, number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer, and include large multi-national engineering firms and smaller local or regional firms.\nIn each of our operating segments, many of our competitors have far greater name recognition and greater financial, technological, marketing and customer service resources than we do. This may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. It may also allow them to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services than we can. Consolidations of end users, distributors and manufacturers in our target markets exacerbate this problem. As a result of the foregoing factors, we may not be able to compete effectively in our target markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully secure new contracts and renew existing contracts could reduce our revenues and profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully bid on new contracts and renew existing contracts with private and public sector customers. We continually bid on new contracts and negotiate contract renewals on expiring contracts. Contract\nproposals and negotiations are complex and frequently involve a lengthy bidding and selection process, which are affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financing arrangements and required governmental approvals. As a condition to contract award, customers require us to provide a surety bond or letter of credit to protect the client should we fail to perform under the terms of the contract. Government entities are also taking more time between contract award and approval to commence work under the contract, which delays our ability to recognize revenues under the contract. If negative market conditions materialize, or if we fail to secure adequate financing arrangements or the required governmental approval or fail to meet other required conditions, we may not be able to pursue, obtain or perform particular projects, which could reduce or eliminate our profitability.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, including senior management, which could seriously harm our business.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent on the continued service of our executive officers and other key management, engineering and technical personnel. We believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team to retain existing business and generate new business. The loss of any of our officers, or any of our other executives or key members of management could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations (e.g., loss of customers or loss of new business opportunities). Our success will also depend in large part upon our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified engineering and other highly skilled technical personnel. Particularly in highly specialized areas, it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which may adversely affect our growth in the current fiscal year and in future years. This situation is exacerbated by pressure from agency customers to contain our costs, while salaries for highly skilled employees are on the rise. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain qualified skilled personnel, we may not be able to attract and retain such employees, which could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations, meet our customers' needs, win new business, and adversely affect our future results. Likewise, the future success of our Transportation Systems segment will depend on our ability to hire additional qualified engineers, planners and technical personnel. Competition for qualified employees, particularly development engineers and software developers, is intense. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of such highly skilled employees. Our inability to attract and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of our current key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect or enforce the proprietary aspects of our technology, competitors may be able to access our proprietary technology and our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be seriously harmed. We currently attempt to protect our technology through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and similar means. Despite our efforts, other parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our technologies or systems. Our competitors may also be able to independently develop products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or design around our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights adequately in the U.S. or internationally.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property rights. An adverse outcome in litigation or any similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license disputed rights from others or require us to cease marketing or using certain products or technologies. We may not be able to obtain any licenses on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may have to indemnify certain customers or strategic partners if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated another party's intellectual property. Our continued expansion into software development activities may subject us to increased possibility of litigation. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of addressing any intellectual property litigation claim, including legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management's attention and resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may continue to be subject to traffic-related litigation.\nThe traffic industry in general is subject to frequent litigation claims due to the nature of personal injuries that can result from traffic accidents. As a provider of traffic engineering services, products and solutions, we are, and could from time to time in the future continue to be, subject to litigation for traffic related accidents, even if our products or services did not cause the particular accident. While we generally carry insurance against these types of claims, some claims may not be covered by insurance or the damages resulting from such litigation could exceed our insurance coverage limits. In the event that we are required to pay significant damages as a result of one or more lawsuits that are not covered by insurance or exceed our coverage limits, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or cash flows. Even defending against unsuccessful claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and result in a diversion of management's attention.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nWe may not be able to consistently achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nWe had net income of approximately $10.1 million in Fiscal 2021, which includes $9.6 million of net income from discontinued operations, and net losses of $5.6 million in Fiscal 2020 and $7.8 million in Fiscal 2019, and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Our ability to operate at a profit in future periods could be impacted by governmental budgetary constraints, government and political agendas, economic instability and other items that are not in our control. Furthermore, we rely on operating profits from certain of our business segments to fund investments in sales and marketing and research and development initiatives. We cannot assure you that our financial performance will sustain a sufficient level to completely support those investments. Most of our expenses are fixed in advance. As such, we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short-term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues or increases in planned investments.\nIf we experience declining or flat revenues and we fail to manage such declines effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan and may experience future weaknesses in our operating results.\nBased on our business objectives, and in order to achieve future growth, we will need to continue to add additional qualified personnel, and invest in additional research and development and sales and marketing activities, which could lead to increases in our expenses and future declines in our operating results. In addition, our past expansion has placed, and future expansion is expected to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage these activities or any revenue declines successfully, our growth, our business, our financial condition and our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected.\nOur use of estimates in conjunction with the input method of measuring progress to completion of performance obligations for our Transportation Systems revenues could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nA portion of Transportation Systems revenues are measured and recognized over time using the input method of measuring progress to completion. Our use of this accounting method results in recognition of revenues and profits proportionally over the life of a contract, based generally on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project. The effects of revisions to revenues and estimated costs are recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. Although we have historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of long-term engineering, program management, construction management or construction contracts, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nDeclines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the value of securities available for sale within our investment portfolio was $3.1 million, which is generally determined based upon market values available from third-party sources. The value of our investment portfolio has fluctuated as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions. Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity. Further, to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary, the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination. Although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks, those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Accordingly, we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly.\nIf our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our business and stock price could be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 currently requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports. We are required to obtain our auditors' attestation pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Going forward, we may not be able to complete the work required for such attestation on a timely basis and, even if we timely complete such requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm may still conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Iteris have been or will be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that technology, decision-making and other processes can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. If we are not able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may lose the confidence of investors and analysts and our stock price could decline.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate as a result of many factors. Therefore, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. Factors that could affect our revenues and operating results include, among others, the following:\n\u2022the Pandemic, which may have a continuing impact on our future operating results;\n\u2022delays in government contracts and funding from time to time and budgetary constraints at the federal, state and local levels;\n\u2022our ability to access stimulus funding, funding from the federal highway bill or other government funding;\n\u2022declines in new home and commercial real estate construction and related road and other infrastructure construction;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies and the pricing policies of our suppliers and competitors, pricing concessions on volume sales, as well as increased price competition in general;\n\u2022the long lead times associated with government contracts;\n\u2022the size, timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, including costs associated with strategic alternatives;\n\u2022the mix of our products and services sold in a quarter, which has varied and is expected to continue to vary from time to time;\n\u2022our ability to develop, introduce, patent, market and gain market acceptance of new products, applications and product enhancements in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022market acceptance of the products incorporating our technologies and products;\n\u2022the introduction of new products by competitors;\n\u2022the availability and cost of components used in the manufacture of our products;\n\u2022our success in expanding and implementing our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022the effects of technological changes in our target markets;\n\u2022the amount of our backlog at any given time;\n\u2022timing of backlog fulfillment;\n\u2022the nature of our government contracts;\n\u2022decrease in revenues derived from key or significant customers;\n\u2022deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products, applications or product enhancements;\n\u2022risks and uncertainties associated with our international business;\n\u2022market condition changes such as industry structure consolidations that could slow down our ability to procure new business;\n\u2022general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022our ability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022international conflicts and acts of terrorism; and\n\u2022other factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, natural disasters.\nDue to all of the factors listed above as well as other unforeseen factors, our future operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As a result of these quarterly variations, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.\nSupply shortages or production gaps could materially and adversely impact our sales and financial results.\nWe have in the past experienced, and may from time to time in the future continue to experience parts shortages or unforeseen quality control issues by our suppliers that may impact our ability to meet demand for our products. The Pandemic has increased the occurrence of such shortages. We have historically used and continue to use single suppliers for certain significant components in our products, and have had to reengineer products from time to time to address obsolete components, especially in our Roadway Sensors products. Our Roadway Sensors products are also included with other traffic intersection products that also could experience supply issues for their products, which in turn could result in delays in orders for our products. Should any such supply delay or disruption occur, or should a key supplier discontinue operations, our future sales and costs will likely be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, we rely heavily on select contract manufacturers to produce many of our products and do not have any long-term contracts to guarantee supply of such products. Although we believe our contract manufacturers have sufficient capacity to meet our production schedules for the foreseeable future and we believe we could find alternative contract manufacturing sources for many of our products, if necessary, we could experience a production gap should for any reason our contract manufacturers become unable to meet our production requirements and our cost of goods sold could increase, adversely affecting our margins. Further, foreign imports of components in our products subject the Company to risks of changes in, or the imposition of new, export/import requirements, tariffs, work stoppages, delays in shipment, product cost increases due to component shortages, public health issues that could lead to temporary closures of facilities or shipping ports, such as the Pandemic and other economic uncertainties, affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source components for our Roadway Sensors products. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such products and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such products, which could adversely affect the financial performance of our Roadway Sensors business. Similarly, these actions could result in cost increases or supply chain delays that impact third party products (e.g. steel poles) which could lead our customers to delay or cancel planned purchases of our products.\nOur international business operations may be threatened by many factors that are outside of our control.\nWhile we historically have had limited international sales, revenues and operational experience, we have been expanding our distribution capabilities for our Roadway Sensors segment internationally, particularly in Europe and in South America. We plan to continue to expand our international efforts, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in such efforts. International operations subject us to various inherent risks including, among others:\n\u2022the Pandemic and related government responses, including travel restrictions, quarantines and \"stay-at-home\" orders;\n\u2022political, social and economic instability, as well as international conflicts and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022bonding requirements for certain international projects;\n\u2022longer accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u2022import and export license requirements and restrictions of the U.S., as well as requirements and restrictions in the other countries in which we operate;\n\u2022currency fluctuations and restrictions, and our ability to repatriate currency from certain foreign regions;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers or restrictions;\n\u2022required compliance with existing and new foreign regulatory requirements and laws, more restrictive labor laws and obligations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nSubstantially all of our international product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the relative value of the dollar could make our products more expensive and potentially less price competitive in international markets. We do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations.\nAny of the factors mentioned above may adversely affect our future international revenues and, consequently, affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, as we pursue the expansion of our international business, certain fixed and other overhead costs could outpace our revenues, thus adversely affecting our results of operations. We may likewise face local competitors in certain international markets who are more established, have greater economies of scale and stronger customer relationships. Furthermore, as we increase our international sales, our total revenues may also be affected to a greater extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower sales that typically occur during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in the past. From March 31, 2017 through March 31, 2021, our common stock has traded at prices as low as $2.08 per share and as high as $8.17 per share. The market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, improve cash flow and sustain profitability;\n\u2022statements made by third parties or speculation regarding our strategic alternatives;\n\u2022our ability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022shortages announced by suppliers;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or new products or applications by our competitors, customers or us;\n\u2022transitions to new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies, or other strategic transactions or dispositions;\n\u2022the impact of any litigation;\n\u2022changes in investor perceptions;\n\u2022government funding, political agendas and other budgetary constraints;\n\u2022changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry in general;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022international conflicts, political unrest and acts of terrorism.\nThe stock market is currently experiencing and has from time to time experienced volatility, which has often affected and may continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we were to become the subject of a class action lawsuit, it could result in substantial losses and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.\nProvisions of our charter documents may discourage a third party from acquiring us and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it difficult for a third party to influence or acquire us, even though that might be beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. For example, under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock with voting, conversion and other rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock. In addition, our bylaws contain provisions governing the ability of stockholders to submit proposals or make nominations for directors. We may also adopt provisions and agreements from time to time that could make it harder for a potential acquirer.", "PERMNO": 67029, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "ITI"}
