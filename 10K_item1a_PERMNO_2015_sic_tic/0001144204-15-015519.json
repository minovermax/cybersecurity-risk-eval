Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and there can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history that can be used to evaluate us, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that we may encounter because we are a small business. As a result, we may not be profitable and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to develop as we have planned.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow will be dependent upon:\n\u25cf management\u2019s ability to maintain the technology and skills necessary for our fuel conversion services;\n\u25cf our ability to keep abreast of changes by government agencies and in the law, particularly in the areas of intellectual property and environmental regulation;\n\u25cf our ability to attract customers who require the products and services we offer;\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues through the sale of our products and services to potential clients; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage the logistics and operations of our company and the distribution of our products and services.\nWe have had operating losses since formation and expect to incur net losses for the near term.\nWe reported a net loss of $7,152,452 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to a net loss of $6,318,724 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. Our operating results have recognized losses in the amount of $2,216,655 and $1,185,818 for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We currently use approximately $363,000 per month to fund operations. We anticipate that we will lose money in the near term and we may not be able to achieve profitable operations. In order to achieve profitable operations we need to secure sales of fuel and Plasma Arc Flow System. We anticipate the need to raise additional capital in the near term to satisfy our plan of operations.\nWe may need additional funding to continue operations, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nTo date, we have generated only limited revenue from our products and have not achieved positive cash flows or profitability. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we incur costs associated with the continuation of our research and development programs, expand our sales and marketing capabilities, increase manufacturing of our products and comply with the requirements related to being a U. S. public company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Additional funding may be needed and it may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funding through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may suffer dilution and our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future income may be limited. If we raise additional funding through debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, require us to use our cash to make payments under such indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we are unable to secure additional funding, our development programs and our commercialization efforts would be delayed, reduced or eliminated, our relationships with our suppliers and customers may be harmed, and we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThe growth of our business depends upon the development and successful commercial acceptance of our products.\nWe depend upon a variety of factors to ensure that our MagneGas and Plasma Arc Flow System are successfully commercialized, including timely and efficient completion of design and development, implementation of manufacturing processes, and effective sales, marketing, and customer service. Because of the complexity of our products, significant delays may occur between development, introduction to the market and volume production phases.\nThe development and commercialization of MagneGas and Plasma Arc Flow System involves many difficulties, including:\n\u25cf retention and hiring of appropriate operational, research and development personnel;\n\u25cf determination of the products\u2019 technical specifications;\n\u25cf successful completion of the development process;\n\u25cf successful marketing of MagneGas and Plasma Arc Flow System and achieving customer acceptance;\n\u25cf managing inventory levels, logistics and operations; and\n\u25cf additional customer service and warranty costs associated with supporting product modifications and/or subsequent potential field upgrades.\nWe must expend significant financial and management resources to develop and market our MagneGas and Plasma Arc Flow System. We cannot assure that we will receive meaningful revenue from these investments. If we are unable to continue to successfully develop or modify our products in response to customer requirements or technological changes, or our products are not commercially successful, our business may be harmed.\nThe possibility of a global financial crisis may significantly impact our business and financial condition and our ability to attract customers to our relatively new technology for the foreseeable future.\nThe turmoil in the global financial system may adversely impact our ability to raise capital, invest in the development and refinement of our technology and to successfully market it to new customers. We may face increasing challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve over time. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have a material negative impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. The economic situation could have a material negative impact on our ability to attract new customers willing to try our alternative fuel products or purchase our technology.\nFailure to comply with government regulations will severely limit our sales opportunities and future revenue.\nFailure to obtain operating permits, or otherwise to comply with federal and state regulatory and environmental requirements, could affect our abilities to market and sell MagneGas and the Plasma Arc Flow System and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe and our customers may be required to comply with a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health and environmental controls. To the extent we intend to market the Plasma Arc Flow System internationally, we will be required to comply with laws and regulations and, when applicable, obtain permits in those other countries.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or maintain, required permits and approvals, that new or more stringent environmental regulations will not be enacted or that if they are, that we will be able to meet the stricter standards.\nOur technology is unproven on a large-scale industrial basis and could fail to perform in an industrial production environment.\nThe Plasma Arc Flow System has never been utilized on a large-scale industrial basis. All of the tests that we have conducted to date with respect to our technology have been performed on limited quantities of liquid waste, and we cannot assure you that the same or similar results could be obtained on a large-scale industrial basis. We cannot predict all of the difficulties that may arise when the technology is utilized on a large-scale industrial basis. In addition, our technology has never operated at a volume level required to be profitable. As our product is an alternative to acetylene, the unstable price of acetylene will impact our ability to become profitable and to sell cost competitive fuel. It is possible that the technology may require further research, development, design and testing prior to implementation of a larger-scale commercial application. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that this technology will perform successfully on a large-scale commercial basis, that it will be profitable to us or that our MagneGas will be cost competitive in the market.\nOur future success is dependent, in part, on the performance and continued service of Ermanno Santilli and other key personnel. Without their continued service, we may be forced to interrupt our operations.\nWe are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of Ermanno Santilli, our President and CEO. Ermanno has several years of experience regarding the technical operation and deployment of our refineries and has built deep relationships with our partners. The loss of any of his services would delay our business operations substantially.\nOur related party transactions may cause conflicts of interests that may adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property was purchased through a related party transaction with Hyfuels, Inc, a company which our former Chairman of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), Dr. Santilli, serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer, who through the transaction became a stockholder of our company. We currently lease our building through a related party transaction with a company wholly-owned by Dr. Santilli and his spouse and director of our company, Carla Santilli. We own a 20% interest in MagneGas Europe, a company whose major stockholder is Ermanno Santilli, our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Dr. Santilli has personally contributed a small refinery for our use and we have received various small notes and loans from related parties, all of which have been paid in full.\nWe believe that these transactions and agreements that we have entered into with these affiliates are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and these affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital or to do business.\nWe have the potential risk of product liability, which may subject us to litigation and related costs.\nOur Plasma Arc Flow System may be utilized in a variety of industrial and other settings, and may be used to handle materials resulting from the user's generation of liquid waste and the creation of a compressed hydrogen based fuel for distribution to end customers. The equipment, cylinders and gas will therefore be subject to risks of breakdowns and malfunctions. There is also inherent risk in the compression, transportation and use of MagneGas. It is possible that claims for personal injury and business losses arising out of these risks, breakdowns and malfunctions will occur. Our insurance may be insufficient to provide coverage against all claims, and claims may be made against us even if covered by our insurance policy for amounts substantially in excess of applicable policy limits. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we are smaller and have fewer financial and other resources than many alternative fuel companies, we may not be able to successfully compete in the very competitive alternative fuel industry.\nFuel is a commodity. There is significant competition among existing alternative fuel producers. Our business faces competition from a number of producers that can produce significantly greater volumes of fuel than we can or expect to produce, producers that can produce a wider range of fuel products than we can, and producers that have the financial and other resources that would enable them to expand their production rapidly if they chose to. These producers may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale and scope, thereby substantially reducing their fixed production costs and their marginal productions costs. If these producers are able to substantially reduce their marginal production costs, the market price of fuel may decline and we may be not be able to produce biogas at a cost that allows us to compete economically. Even if we are able to operate profitably, these other producers may be substantially more profitable than us, which may make it more difficult for us to raise any financing necessary for us to achieve our business plan and may have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCosts of compliance with burdensome or changing environmental and operational safety regulations could cause our focus to be diverted away from our business and our results of operations may suffer.\nLiquid waste disposal and fuel production involves the discharge of potential contaminants into the water and air and is subject to various regulatory and safety requirements. As a result, we are subject to complicated environmental regulations of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and regulations and permitting requirements of the various states. These regulations are subject to change and such changes may require additional capital expenditures or increased operating costs. Consequently, considerable resources may be required to comply with future environmental regulations. In addition, our production plants could be subject to environmental nuisance or related claims by employees, property owners or residents near the plants arising from air or water discharges. Environmental and public nuisance claims, or tort claims based on emissions, or increased environmental compliance costs resulting therefrom could significantly increase our operating costs.\nBecause MagneGas is new to the metalworking market, it may take time for the industry to adapt to it. In addition, the economy may adversely impact consumption of fuel in the metalworking market making it more difficult for us to sell our product.\nMagneGas is a replacement for acetylene for the metalworking market. Because MagneGas is a new product in the industry, it may take time for end users to consider changing from acetylene to MagneGas and as such this may adversely impact our sales. In addition, consumption for fuel in the metalworking market is highly dependent on the economic conditions of the manufacturing industry and as such adverse conditions in the economy may also negatively impact our ability to sell our fuel to market.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could harm our operating results.\nThere is significant competition among existing alternative fuel producers. Some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause our long-term plan depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solutions to customers located outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe have limited experience operating in foreign jurisdictions. We continue to explore opportunities for joint ventures internationally. Our inexperience in operating our business outside of North America increases the risk that our current and any future international expansion efforts will not be successful. Conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that, generally, we have not faced in the United States, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf localization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards, including laws and regulations related to privacy;\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u25cf reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe success of our business depends, in part, upon proprietary technologies and information that may be difficult to protect and may be perceived to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe believe that the identification, acquisition and development of proprietary technologies are key drivers of our business. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain the secrecy of our proprietary technology and information, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, that the patents that provide us with competitive advantages will not be challenged by third parties, that we will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable or that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages. Further, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies, duplicate elements of our biomass technology or design around it.\nTo successfully commercialize our proprietary technologies, we may need to acquire licenses to use, or to contest the validity of, issued or pending patents. We cannot assure you that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we would prevail in any such contest. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another party's patents or in defending the validity or enforceability of our patents, or in bringing patent infringement suits against other parties based on our patents.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our prospective joint venture partners, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.\nWe cannot assure you that we will obtain any patent protection that we seek, that any protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged or that it will confer any significant commercial advantage. U. S. patents and patent applications may be subject to interference proceedings, U. S. patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings in the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of, the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Moreover, the U. S. patent laws may change, possibly making it easier to challenge patents. Some of our technology was, and continues to be, developed in conjunction with third parties, and thus there is a risk that such third parties may claim rights in our intellectual property. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may provide limited or no protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology.\nMany of our competitors have significant resources and incentives to apply for and obtain intellectual property rights that could limit or prevent our ability to commercialize our current or future products in the United States or abroad.\nMany of our potential competitors who have significant resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. Our current or future U. S. or foreign patents may be challenged, circumvented by competitors or others or may be found to be invalid, unenforceable or insufficient. Since patent applications are confidential until patents are issued in the United States, or in most cases, until after 18 months from filing of the application, or corresponding applications are published in other countries, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public float, limited operating history and lack of profits, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that trade on a national securities exchange and have large public floats, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than the shares of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, shares of our common stock are, compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our shares of common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand. Secondly, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our limited operating history, lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that trades on a national securities exchange and has a large public float. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nFuture sales of our common stocks in the public market by management or our large stockholders could lower our stock price.\nOur largest stockholders, together with the other members of our Board and our executive officers, collectively beneficially own approximately 27.60% of our outstanding common stock. If our officers, directors and current stockholders sell, or indicate intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly.\nWe have a significant number of warrants outstanding, and while these warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital. Additionally, certain of these warrants contain price-protection provisions that may result in the reduction of their exercise prices if certain transactions occur in the future.\nAs of March 2, 2015, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 12,619,675 shares of common stock. The holders of these warrants are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while these warrants are outstanding. At any time during which these warrants are likely to be exercised, we may be unable to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms from other sources. Furthermore, the majority of these warrants contain price-protection provisions under which, if we were to issue securities in conjunction with a merger, tender offer, sale of assets or reclassification of our common stock at a price lower than the exercise price of such warrants, the exercise price of the warrants would be reduced, with certain exceptions, to the lower price. Additionally, the exercise of these warrants will cause the increase of our outstanding shares of our common stock, which could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we decide to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock could be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we could lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nOur shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price may not reflect our value and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock now or in the future.\nOur common stock only began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 15, 2012, before which it was quoted on the OTCBB. Our stock has limited liquidity, as our common stock has historically been sporadically and thinly traded. The price of our common stock, when traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Market liquidity will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result, holders of our securities may have difficulty finding purchasers for our shares should they attempt to sell shares held by them. Even if a more active market should develop, the price of our shares of common stock may be highly volatile. Our shares should be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our shares for an indefinite period of time.\nOn December 11, 2014, the Company received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that the Company\u2019s common stock was subject to potential delisting from the Nasdaq because for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days, the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock had closed below the minimum $1. 00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2)(the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d). The notification has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the common stock on the Nasdaq.\nNasdaq stated in its letter that in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules the Company has been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until June 9, 2015, to regain compliance. The letter states that the Nasdaq Staff will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum bid price listing requirement if at any time before June 9, 2015, the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock closes at $1. 00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.\nIf the Company is unable to regain compliance by June 9, 2015, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period to demonstrate compliance with the bid price requirement. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares set forth in Market Place Rule 5550(a) and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Marketplace Rule 5505, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice to Nasdaq of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company does not qualify for the second compliance period or fails to regain compliance during the second 180 day period, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist the Company\u2019s common stock, at which point the Company would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.\nThe Company will continue to monitor the bid price for its common stock and consider various options available to it if its common stock does not trade at a level that is likely to regain compliance. These options include effecting a reverse stock split.\nNo assurances can be made that our common stock will remain listed on Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are not able to comply with the Nasdaq Capital requirements, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and our common stock would likely be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the OTC Pink Sheets. As a consequence of any such delisting, a stockholder would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of our common stock. Also, a delisting of our common stock would adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and harm our business.\nCertain members of our Board, their affiliates and our executive officers, as stockholders, control our company.\nOur largest stockholders together with the other members of our Board and our executive officers, as stockholders, collectively beneficially own approximately 27.60% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this ownership, they have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders of our company, including the election of directors. In particular, Dr. Santilli, the former Chairman of our Board, beneficially owns 14.17% of our outstanding common stock. In addition to ownership of our common stock, Dr. Santilli and his spouse Carla Santilli, together with their children, Ermanno Santilli, our Chief Executive Officer, and Luisa Ingargiola, our Chief Financial Officer (the \u201cSantilli Family\u201d), beneficially maintain voting control over 100% of our outstanding 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, which entitles the Santilli Family to voting rights in the aggregate of 100,000,000,000 votes. As a result, the Santilli Family has the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders of our company. This concentration of ownership also may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price could decline.\nSecurities analysts from Northland Capital Markets currently cover our common stock but may not do so in the future. Our lack of analyst coverage might depress the price of our common stock and result in limited trading volume. If we do receive analyst coverage in the future, any negative reports published by such analysts could have similar effects.\nFuture issuance of our common stock could dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe application of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit trading activity in the market, and our stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock.\nOur common stock trades at less than $5. 00 per share and is therefore subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5. 00. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and you must rely on increases in the market price of our common stock for returns on equity investment.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may delay or deter a change of control transaction.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring takeovers, such as those provisions authorizing our Board to issue, from time to time, any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock; prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting; requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; requiring a 66 2/3% majority stockholder approval in order for stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or adopt new bylaws; providing that, subject to the rights of preferred shares, the directors will be divided into three classes and the number of directors is to be fixed exclusively by our Board; and providing that none of our directors may be removed without cause. Section203 of the DGCL, from which we did not elect to opt out, provides that if a holder acquires 15% or more of our stock without prior approval of our Board, that holder will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to acquire us within three years. These provisions may delay or deter a change of control of us, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13556, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TRNX"}
