{"cik": "1492658", "company": "Wright Medical Group N.V.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are affected by risks specific to us as well as factors that affect all businesses operating in a global market. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, careful consideration should be taken of the factors described below, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The risk factors described below may relate solely to one or more of the legal entities contained in our corporate structure and may not necessarily apply to Wright Medical Group N.V. or one or more of the other legal entities contained in our corporate structure.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Wright by Stryker\nThe proposed acquisition of Wright by Stryker is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. Failure to complete the proposed acquisition within the expected time frame, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and our share price.\nOn November 4, 2019, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Stryker and Stryker\u2019s subsidiary, Stryker B.V., related to the proposed acquisition of Wright by Stryker (the Acquisition). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. has commenced a tender offer (the Offer) to purchase all of our outstanding ordinary shares. If certain conditions are satisfied or waived to the extent they can be waived and the Offer closes,\nStryker may acquire any Wright shares that were not tendered in the Offer through a reorganization of the company. The obligation of Stryker and Stryker B.V. to consummate the Offer is subject to the condition that there be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of ordinary shares representing at least 95% of the ordinary shares outstanding as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer (such condition, the Minimum Condition); provided, that Stryker may elect to reduce the Minimum Condition to a percentage of not less than 80%; and provided further that if Wright\u2019s shareholders have adopted certain resolutions related to the reorganization of the company at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, the Minimum Condition will be reduced to 80%. The Minimum Condition may not be waived by Stryker without the prior written consent of Wright. The obligation of Stryker B.V. to consummate the Offer is also subject to the expiration of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (HSR Act), and the receipt of other required approvals and clearances under applicable antitrust laws, the adoption of certain resolutions by Wright\u2019s shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders and other customary conditions. We currently expect the Acquisition to close during the second half of 2020, but no assurance can be provided that it will close within this time frame, or at all.\nWe cannot predict whether and when the conditions to the Offer will be satisfied. If one or more of these conditions is not satisfied, and as a result, we do not complete the proposed Acquisition, we would remain liable for significant transaction costs, and the focus of our management would have been diverted from seeking other potential strategic opportunities, in each case without realizing any benefits of the proposed Acquisition. Certain costs associated with the proposed Acquisition have already been incurred or may be payable even if the proposed Acquisition is not consummated. Finally, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed Acquisition, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, partners, suppliers and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event that we fail to consummate the proposed Acquisition.\nOur share price may also fluctuate significantly based on announcements by Stryker and other third parties or us regarding the Acquisition or based on market perceptions of the likelihood of the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition or other conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition. Such announcements may lead to perceptions in the market that the Acquisition may not be completed, which could cause our share price to fluctuate or decline. If we do not consummate the Acquisition, the price of our ordinary shares may decline significantly from the current market price, which may reflect a market assumption that the proposed Acquisition will be consummated. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and could cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.\nThe Offer consideration payable to holders of our ordinary shares will not be adjusted for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations, or in the event of any change in our share price.\nThe Offer consideration payable to holders of our ordinary shares will not be adjusted for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations, or changes in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our ordinary shares. For example, if we experienced an improvement in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations prior to the consummation of the proposed Acquisition, there would be no adjustment to the amount of the proposed Offer consideration.\nThe Purchase Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed not to solicit or initiate discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire Wright and are subject to restrictions on our ability to respond to any such proposal, except as permitted under the terms of the Purchase Agreement. In the event that we receive an acquisition proposal from a third party, we must notify Stryker of such proposal and negotiate in good faith with Stryker prior to terminating the Purchase Agreement or effecting a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors to our shareholders with respect to the proposed Acquisition. The Purchase Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both Stryker and us and further provides that, upon termination of the Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances, including certain terminations in connection with an alternative business combination transaction as permitted by the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we will be required to pay Stryker a termination fee of $150 million.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Acquisition. These provisions also might result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our shareholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay due to the added expense of the $150 million termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Purchase Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the proposed Acquisition.\nShareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the proposed Acquisition or otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of existing and any future shareholder litigation in connection with the proposed Acquisition, including the two shareholder lawsuits to date that have been brought against us in connection with the Acquisition. See Legal Proceedings for additional information regarding these lawsuits. These lawsuits or other future litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the proposed Acquisition. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of obligations to our directors. Furthermore, one of the conditions to the closing of the proposed Acquisition is the absence of any governmental order or law preventing the Acquisition or making the consummation of the proposed Acquisition illegal. Consequently, if a plaintiff were to secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our ability to complete the proposed Acquisition, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the proposed Acquisition from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all.\nWe may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the proposed Acquisition.\nOne of the conditions to consummation of the proposed Acquisition is receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act and antitrust notification and approvals in certain European and other jurisdictions. On December 31, 2019, Wright and Stryker each received a request for additional information and documentary materials with respect to the Offer (a Second Request) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. As a result of the Second Requests, the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the Offer has been extended until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 10th calendar day following the date on which Stryker substantially complies with the Second Request it received, unless such waiting period is earlier terminated. Thereafter, the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with Stryker\u2019s consent. There can be no assurance that such regulatory approvals, or any other regulatory approvals that might be required to consummate the proposed Acquisition, will be obtained. If such regulatory approvals are obtained, there can be no assurance as to the timing of such approvals, our ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of any litigation challenging such approvals.\nAt any time before or after the consummation of the proposed Acquisition (and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act), the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission or any state or non-U.S. governmental entity could take such action, under antitrust laws or otherwise, as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the consummation of the proposed Acquisition or seeking the divestiture of substantial assets. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under antitrust laws under certain circumstances. If the proposed Acquisition does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs delaying or preventing the proposed Acquisition, such delay or failure to complete the proposed Acquisition may create uncertainty or otherwise have negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the price per share for our ordinary shares.\nWhile the proposed Acquisition is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could disrupt our business, and the proposed Acquisition may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees or retain and maintain relationships with our customers, suppliers and other business partners.\nWhether or not the proposed Acquisition is consummated, the proposed Acquisition may disrupt our current plans and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The pendency of the Acquisition may also divert management\u2019s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations and our employees and other key personnel may have uncertainties about the effect of the proposed Acquisition, and the uncertainties may impact our ability to retain, recruit and hire key personnel while the proposed Acquisition is pending or if it fails to close. Furthermore, if key personnel depart because of such uncertainties, or because they do not wish to remain with the combined company after closing, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we cannot predict how our suppliers, customers and other business partners will view or react to the proposed Acquisition upon consummation. If we are unable to reassure our customers, suppliers and other business partners to continue transacting business with us, our sales, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Purchase Agreement generally requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, pending consummation of the Acquisition, and restricts us from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs without Stryker\u2019s consent. Such restrictions will be in place until either the Acquisition is consummated or the Purchase Agreement is terminated. These restrictions could restrict our ability to, or prevent us from, pursuing attractive business opportunities (if any) that arise prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. For these and other reasons, the pendency of the Acquisition could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the proposed Acquisition.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs, in connection with the Acquisition, including costs that we may not currently expect. We must pay substantially all of these costs and expenses whether or not the transaction is completed. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we would be required to pay to Stryker a termination fee equal to $150 million. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and at December 29, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.7 billion. Our ability to achieve profitability will be influenced by many factors, including, among others, the success of prior acquisitions; the level and timing of future net sales and expenditures; development, commercialization and market acceptance of new products; the results and scope of ongoing research and development projects; competing technologies and market developments; regulatory requirements and delays; and pending litigation. As a result, we may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. These losses will continue to have an adverse impact on our shareholders\u2019 equity, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur strategy to become a profitable, high-growth, pure-play medical technology company and command the market valuation typically accorded such companies may not be successful.\nThe divestiture of the OrthoRecon business, the Wright/Tornier merger, the divestiture of legacy Tornier\u2019s large joints business and our acquisitions of IMASCAP and Cartiva are part of our strategy to transform ourselves into a profitable, high-growth, pure-play medical technology company and command the market valuation typically accorded such companies. If we are unable to achieve our growth and profitability objectives due to competition, lack of acceptance of our products, failure to gain regulatory approvals, or other risks as described in this section or other sections of this report, or due to other events, we will not be successful in transforming our business and will not be accorded the market valuation we seek.\nOur digital strategy to develop new platforms, accelerate surgical solutions and drive software technology innovation across our business may not be successful and, even if successful, may increase or accentuate certain existing risks or add new risks and complications to our business.\nIn May 2019, we announced the creation of a new digital organization intended to execute on our strategy to develop new platforms, accelerate surgical solutions and drive software technology innovation across our business organization headed by a new Chief Digital Officer. Our digital strategy is to build upon our highly differentiated, market-leading BLUEPRINT\u2122 software by leveraging emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, to provide innovative and transformative software-enabled surgery platforms and solutions for the extremities markets. While we believe the opportunities for Wright in further developing and deploying our digital technology, including our BLUEPRINT platform into other areas, are significant, we can provide no assurance that our digital strategy, and the investments we intend to make in furtherance thereof, will be successful due to factors, including, among others, competition, lack of acceptance, failure to gain regulatory approvals, or other risks as described in this section or other sections of this report, or due to other events. Even if we are successful in implementing our digital strategy, this strategy may increase or accentuate certain existing risks or add new risks and complications to our business, including, among others, risks involving intellectual property; data acquisition, maintenance, privacy and security; regulatory requirements; clinical effectiveness; physician training; product and software errors and defects; product recall and safety; changing industry standards and customer preferences; competition; technology obsolescence; need to hire and retain qualified personnel; and market acceptance. If these or any other risks materialize with respect to our digital strategy, our business, operating results and reputation could be harmed.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits of our strategic business combinations or acquisition transactions.\nIn addition to developing new products and growing our business internally, we have sought to grow through business combinations and acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and products. Examples include our acquisition of Cartiva in October 2018, our acquisition of IMASCAP in December 2017, the Wright/Tornier merger in October 2015, legacy Wright\u2019s acquisition of BioMimetic in early 2013, as well as its acquisitions of Biotech International in November 2013, Solana Surgical, LLC in January 2014, and OrthoPro, L.L.C. in February 2014. Business combinations and acquiring new businesses involve a myriad of risks. Whenever new businesses are combined or acquired, there is a risk we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits, financial or otherwise, of the transaction. This failure could be a result of clinical issues with acquired products, introduction of competitive products with superior attributes than the acquired products, the failure to achieve wide market acceptance of the acquired products due to regulatory, cost, reimbursement or other issues, or a delay or failure to drive sales of the acquired products to anticipated levels.\nWe may fail to realize the expected benefits of our business combinations or acquisitions if the combined or acquired business fails to meet our net sales projections, exposes us to unexpected liabilities, or if our pre-acquisition due diligence fails to uncover\nissues that negatively affect the value or cost structure of the acquired enterprise. Additionally, if integration of the businesses proves to be more complicated than planned, we may fail to realize operational synergies and/or fail to mitigate operational dis-synergies resulting in diversion of management attention and/or loss of key personnel. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, including decreasing or delaying an anticipated accretive effect of a transaction, or result in a decrease in our share price or new litigation.\nAlthough we carefully plan our business combinations and acquisitions, there can be no assurances that these and other risks will not prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of these transactions. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, our ordinary share price could be materially adversely affected. Finally, future acquisitions may require equity or debt financing, the dilutive or other effects of which could negatively impact the anticipated benefits of the transaction or restrict our business.\nWe anticipate significant future sales from our AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft products. If we are wrong, our future operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe obtained FDA approval of AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft in the United States for ankle and/or hindfoot fusion indications during the third quarter of 2015 and FDA approval of AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable Bone Graft (AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable), which combines rhPDGF-BB with an injectable bone matrix, in June 2018. We expect significant future sales from our AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft products. If these sales expectations are not met, our future operating results, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may not achieve our financial guidance or projected goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate or announce publicly, which could have an adverse effect on our business and could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nPrior to the public announcement of the proposed Acquisition, we typically provided projected financial information, such as our anticipated annual net sales, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. These financial projections were based on management\u2019s then current expectations and typically did not contain any significant margin of error or cushion for any specific uncertainties or for the uncertainties inherent in all financial forecasting. The failure to achieve any future financial projections we may provide or the projections of analysts and investors could have an adverse effect on our business, disappoint analysts and investors, and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. Our net sales performance has been outside of our guidance range in certain quarters, which negatively impacted the market price of our ordinary shares, and could do so in the future should our results fall below our guidance range and the expectations of analysts and investors.\nWe also set goals and objectives for, and make public statements regarding, the timing of certain accomplishments and milestones regarding our business or operating results, such as the anticipated timing of the proposed Acquisition, long-term financial targets, the timing of financial objectives, new products, regulatory actions, pending litigation, and anticipated distributor and sales representative transitions. The achievement of these goals and objectives and the actual timing of these events can vary dramatically due to a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this report. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in achieving our projected goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate or announce publicly. The failure to achieve such projected goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate or announce publicly could have an adverse effect on our business, disappoint investors and analysts, and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations, and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\ndemand for products, which historically has been lowest in the third quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the demand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition;\n\u2022\nthe number, timing, and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce, and market new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for products;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing policies by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the treatment practices of orthopaedic surgeons;\n\u2022\nchanges in distributor relationships and sales force size and composition;\n\u2022\nthe timing of material expense- or income-generating events and the related recognition of their associated financial impact;\n\u2022\nthe number and mix of products sold in the quarter and the geographies in which they are sold;\n\u2022\nthe number of selling days;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of components and materials;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates on our excess cash investments;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe timing of significant orders and shipments;\n\u2022\nability to obtain reimbursement for our products and the timing of patients\u2019 use of their calendar year medical insurance deductibles;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or strikes in the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in FDA and foreign governmental regulatory policies, requirements, and enforcement practices;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, estimates, and treatments;\n\u2022\nrestructuring, impairment, and other special charges, costs associated with our pending litigation and U.S. governmental inquiries, and other charges;\n\u2022\nvariations in cost of sales due to the amount and timing of excess and obsolete inventory charges, commodity prices, and manufacturing variances;\n\u2022\nincome tax fluctuations and changes in tax rules;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic factors; and\n\u2022\nincreases of interest rates, which can increase the cost of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, and generally affect the level of economic activity.\nWe believe our quarterly sales and operating results may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. We cannot assure you that our sales will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period. Any shortfalls in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities or orthopaedic industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares in any given period.\nAlthough legacy Wright divested the OrthoRecon business, legacy Wright remains responsible, as between it and MicroPort, for liability claims on OrthoRecon products sold prior to closing and might still be sued on products sold after closing.\nAlthough OrthoRecon product liability expenses are accounted for under our discontinued operations, the agreement between WMG and MicroPort requires that legacy Wright, as between it and MicroPort, retain responsibility for product liability claims on OrthoRecon products sold prior to closing and for any resulting settlements, judgments, or other costs. Moreover, even though MicroPort, as between it and legacy Wright, is responsible for liability claims on post-closing sales, there can be no assurance we will not be named as a defendant in a lawsuit relating to such post-closing sales, or that MicroPort will have adequate resources to exonerate legacy Wright from any resulting expenses or liabilities.\nProduct liability lawsuits could harm our business and adversely affect our operating results or results from discontinued operations and financial condition if adverse outcomes exceed our product liability insurance coverage.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims. We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to the OrthoRecon business, which legacy Wright divested to MicroPort in 2014. Legacy Wright remains responsible, as between it and MicroPort, for claims associated with products sold before divesting the OrthoRecon business to MicroPort.\nWe have been named as a defendant, in some cases with multiple other defendants, in lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain defects in the design, manufacture, or labeling of certain metal-on-metal and other hip replacement products rendered the products defective. The pre-trial management of certain of the metal-on-metal claims was consolidated in the federal court system, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under multi-district litigation (MDL) and certain other claims by the Judicial Counsel Coordinated Proceedings in state court in Los Angeles County, California (JCCP). Pursuant to previously disclosed settlement agreements with the Court-appointed attorneys representing plaintiffs in the MDL and JCCP, the MDL and JCCP were closed to new cases effective October 18, 2017 and October 31, 2017, respectively. Excluding claims resolved in the settlement agreements, as of December 29, 2019, there were approximately 205 unresolved metal-on-metal hip cases pending in the U.S. This number includes cases ineligible for settlement, cases which opted out of settlement, post-settlement cases, tolled cases, and existing state court cases that were not part of the MDL or JCCP. As of December 29, 2019, we estimate there also were pending approximately 27 non-U.S. metal-on metal cases, 9 unresolved U.S. modular neck cases alleging claims related to the release of metal ions and zero non-U.S. modular neck cases with such metal ion allegations, 22 unresolved U.S. titanium modular neck fracture cases, 50 unresolved non-U.S. titanium modular neck fracture cases, seven U.S. cobalt chrome modular neck fracture cases, and seven non-U.S. cobalt chrome modular neck fracture cases. We also estimate that as of December 29, 2019 there were approximately 514 non-revision claims either dismissed or awaiting dismissal from the MDL and JCCP pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreements. Although there is a limited time period during which dismissed non-revision claims may be refiled, it is presently unclear how many non-revision claimants will elect to do so. As of December 29, 2019, no dismissed non-revision case has been refiled. We believe we have data that supports the efficacy and safety of these hip products and have been vigorously defending these cases.\nOur material product liability litigation is discussed in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. These matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable. Regardless of the outcome of these matters, legal defenses are costly. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial legal expenses in connection with the defense of these matters. We could incur significant liabilities associated with adverse outcomes that exceed our products liability insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our operating results or results from discontinued operations and financial condition. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or results from discontinued operations, and cash flows.\nIn the future, we may be subject to additional product liability claims. We also could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts and product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, significant litigation and other costs, substantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients, product recalls, loss of revenue, and the inability to commercialize new products or product candidates, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nOur settlement agreements with insurance carriers include broad releases of coverage for present and future claims of personal injury alleged to be caused by metal-on-metal hip components or the release of metal ions, which could result in inadequate insurance coverage to defend and resolve these claims.\nOn October 28, 2016, our WMT and WMG subsidiaries entered into a Settlement Agreement with a subgroup of three insurance carriers, Columbia Casualty Company (Columbia), St. Paul Surplus Lines Insurance Company and AXIS Surplus Lines Insurance Company (Three Settling Insurers), pursuant to which the Three Settling Insurers paid $60 million (in addition to $10 million previously paid) in full settlement of all potential liability of the Three Settling Insurers for metal ion and metal-on-metal hip claims, including but not limited to all claims in the MDL and the JCCP. As part of the settlement, the Three Settling Insurers repurchased their policies in the five policy years beginning with the 2007-2008 policy year.\nOn February 22, 2018, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (Second Insurance Settlement Agreement) with Federal Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance (Federal), pursuant to which Federal has paid us a single lump sum payment of $15 million (in addition to $5 million previously paid by Federal). This amount is in full satisfaction of all potential liability of Federal relating to designated metal-on-metal hip claims, including but not limited to all claims asserted by our subsidiary, WMT, against Federal in the previously disclosed insurance coverage litigation.\nOn April 19, 2018, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (Third Insurance Settlement Agreement) with Catlin Underwriting Agencies Limited for and on behalf of Syndicate 2003 at Lloyd\u2019s of London (Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 2003), pursuant to which Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 2003 has paid us a single lump sum payment of $1.9 million (in addition to $5 million previously paid by Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 2003). This amount is in full satisfaction of all potential liability of Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 2003 relating to designated metal-on-metal hip claims, including but not limited to all claims asserted by our subsidiary WMT against Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 2003 in the previously disclosed insurance coverage litigation.\nOn October 7, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with Lexington Insurance Company (Lexington) to settle all presently remaining disputes between us, pursuant to which, among other things, Lexington bought back the subject insurance policies for an aggregate of $15.5 million (in addition to $5 million previously paid by Lexington). This settlement is in full satisfaction of all potential liability of Lexington relating to metal-on-metal hip claims, including but not limited to all claims asserted by our subsidiary, WMT, against Lexington.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned settlement agreements, we have no further coverage from the Three Settling Insurers for present or future metal-on-metal or metal ion claims, and we have no further coverage from Federal, Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 2003 or Lexington for present or future metal-on-metal claims (as defined in the settlement agreements).\nOur existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur.\nIf the product liability claims brought against us involve uninsured liabilities or result in liabilities that exceed our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Further, such product liability matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain insurance coverage or cost-effective insurance coverage in future periods.\nMicroPort\u2019s recall of a certain size of its cobalt chrome modular neck device due to alleged fractures could result in additional product liability claims against us. Although we have contested these claims, adverse outcomes could harm our business and adversely affect our results from discontinued operations and financial condition.\nIn August 2015, MicroPort announced the voluntary recall of a certain size of its PROFEMUR\u00ae Long Cobalt Chrome Modular Neck devices manufactured from June 15, 2009 to July 22, 2015. Because MicroPort did not acquire the OrthoRecon business\nuntil January 2014, many of the recalled devices were sold by legacy Wright prior to the acquisition by MicroPort. Under the asset purchase agreement with MicroPort, legacy Wright retained responsibility, as between it and MicroPort, for claims for personal injury relating to sales of these products prior to the acquisition. We were not consulted by MicroPort in connection with its recall, and we were aware of only 14 lawsuits alleging personal injury related to cobalt chrome neck fractures (seven in the United States and seven outside the United States) as of December 29, 2019. However, if the number of product liability claims alleging personal injury from fractures of cobalt chrome modular necks we sold prior to the MicroPort transaction were to become significant, this could have an adverse effect on our results from discontinued operations and financial condition.\nA competitor\u2019s recall of its modular hip systems, and the liability claims and adverse publicity which ensued, could generate copycat claims against modular hip systems legacy Wright sold.\nOn July 6, 2012, Stryker announced the voluntary recall of its Rejuvenate Modular and ABG II modular neck hip stems citing risks including the potential for fretting and/or corrosion at or about the modular neck junction. Although Stryker\u2019s recalled modular neck hip stems differ in design and material from the PROFEMUR\u00ae modular neck systems legacy Wright sold before divestiture of the OrthoRecon business, we have previously noted the risk that Stryker\u2019s recall and the resultant publicity could negatively impact sales of modular neck systems of other manufacturers, including the PROFEMUR\u00ae system, and that Stryker\u2019s action has increased industry focus on the safety of cobalt chrome modular neck products. We have carefully monitored the clinical performance of the PROFEMUR\u00ae modular neck hip system, which combine a cobalt chrome modular neck and a titanium stem. With over 33,000 units sold since this version was introduced in 2009, and an extremely low complaint rate, we remain confident in the safety and efficacy of this product. Nevertheless, in light of Stryker\u2019s recall, the resulting product liability claims to which it has been subject, and the general negative publicity surrounding \u201cmetal-on-metal\u201d articulating surfaces (which do not involve modular hip stems), there remains a risk that, even in the absence of clinical evidence, claims for personal injury relating to sales of these products before divestiture of the OrthoRecon business could increase, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results from discontinued operations since legacy Wright retained responsibility, as between it and MicroPort, for these claims. Since the 2012 Stryker recall, we have from time to time been subject to product liability claims alleging corrosion of cobalt chrome modular necks. We presently have approximately nine such unresolved lawsuits pending in various U.S. courts and zero non-U.S. cases with such allegations.\nAlthough we believe the use of corporate entities in our corporate structure will preclude creditors of any one particular entity within our corporate structure from reaching the assets of the other entities within our corporate structure not liable for the underlying claims of the one particular entity, there is a risk that, despite our corporate structure, creditors could be successful in piercing the corporate veil and reaching the assets of such other entities, which could have an adverse effect on us and our operating results, results from discontinued operations, and financial condition.\nWe maintain separate legal entities within our overall corporate structure. We believe our ring-fenced structure with separate legal entities should preclude any corporate veil-piercing, alter ego, control person, or other similar claims by creditors of any one particular entity within our corporate structure from reaching the assets of the other entities within our corporate structure to satisfy claims of the one particular entity. However, if a court were to disagree and allow a creditor to pierce the corporate veil and reach the assets of such other entities within our corporate structure, despite such entities not being liable for the underlying claims, it could have a material adverse effect on us and our operating results, results from discontinued operations, and financial condition.\nIf we lose any existing or future intellectual property lawsuits, a court could require us to pay significant damages or prevent us from selling our products.\nThe medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.\nWe are party to claims and lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property. Legal proceedings, regardless of the outcome, could drain our financial resources and divert the time and effort of our management. If we lose one of these proceedings, a court, or a similar foreign governing body, could require us to pay significant damages to third parties, indemnify third parties from loss, require us to seek licenses from third parties, pay ongoing royalties, redesign our products, or prevent us from manufacturing, using or selling our products. In addition to being costly, protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIf our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nWe rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements, and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not completely protect our rights. In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will issue. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may deny or require a significant narrowing of the claims in its pending patent applications and the patents issuing from such applications. Any patents issuing from the pending patent applications may not provide us with significant\ncommercial protection. We could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws or at all. We also may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries.\nIn addition, we hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products. The loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing, marketing, and selling these products, which could harm our business. If we, or the other parties from whom we would license intellectual property, fail to obtain and maintain adequate patent or other intellectual property protection for intellectual property used in our products, or if any protection is reduced or eliminated, others could use the intellectual property used in our products, resulting in harm to our competitive business position.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology, in part, with confidentiality agreements with our employees, independent distributors, and consultants. We cannot be assured, however, that the agreements will not be breached, adequate remedies for any breach would be available, or our trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness including, as of December 29, 2019, $814.6 million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest under WMG\u2019s 1.625% cash convertible senior notes due 2023 (2023 Notes), $395.0 million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest under our 2.25% cash convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) and $56.5 million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest under WMG\u2019s 2.00% cash convertible senior notes due 2020 (2020 Notes, together with the 2023 Notes and 2021 Notes, the Notes). The 2023 Notes and 2020 Notes are guaranteed by Wright Medical Group N.V. In addition, under our amended and restated credit, security and guaranty agreement (as amended, Credit Agreement) with Midcap Funding IV Trust and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto (Lenders), WMG and certain of our other wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries have access to a $175 million senior secured asset based line of credit, subject to the satisfaction of a borrowing base requirement, and which may be increased by up to $75 million upon our request, subject to the consent of the Lenders (ABL Facility), as well as a $55 million term loan facility (Term Loan Facility), an initial $20 million of which was funded at closing of this facility in May 2018 and the remaining $35 million of which is available to be borrowed until May 7, 2021. As of December 29, 2019, $20.7 million in aggregate principal plus additional accrued interest was outstanding under the ABL Facility and $20.0 million in aggregate principal plus additional accrued interest was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. As of December 29, 2019, our total indebtedness under the Notes and Credit Agreement was $1.3 billion, excluding accrued interest, unamortized debt discount, and unamortized deferred financing fees.\nOur ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, including the Notes and amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility, and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures, contractual cash obligations, research and development efforts, working capital, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness, including payments of principal upon conversion of outstanding Notes, on their respective maturity dates, on the maturity date of the Credit Agreement or in connection with a transaction involving us that constitutes a fundamental change under the respective indenture governing the Notes or under the Credit Agreement, or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity dates thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek to raise additional capital, or take other similar actions. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including market conditions. In addition, in the event of a default under the Notes or under the Credit Agreement, the holders and/or the trustee under the indentures governing the Notes or the Lenders may accelerate payment obligations under the Notes and/or the amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement, respectfully, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the Notes and Credit Agreement contain cross default provisions. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would likely have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, research and development efforts, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness, and if we do, the risks related to our business and our ability to service our indebtedness would increase.\nIn addition, under our Notes, we are required to offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, which would include consummation of the Offer. We also expect that the Offer will trigger certain conversion rights under each of the indentures governing the Notes prior to the closing of the proposed Acquisition.\nWith respect to the 2021 Notes which have been issued by Wright Medical Group N.V., we are dependent on the cash flow of, and dividends and distributions to us from, our subsidiaries in order to service our indebtedness under these Notes. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to any indebtedness of ours or to make any funds available therefor, except for those subsidiaries that have guaranteed our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay any dividends and distributions will be subject to, among other things, the terms of any debt instruments of our subsidiaries then in effect as well as among other things, the availability of profits or funds and requirements of applicable laws, including surplus, solvency and other limits imposed on the ability of companies to pay dividends. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate cash flow sufficient to pay dividends or distributions to us that enable us to pay interest or principal on our existing indebtedness.\nA failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of the indentures governing the Notes or the Credit Agreement could result in events of default under such indentures or Credit Agreement, especially in light of the cross default provisions, which could require the immediate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the indentures, the Credit Agreement and other agreements relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible, or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement could limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions.\nOur Credit Agreement includes a number of significant financial and operating restrictions. For example, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum liquidity and achieve certain revenue thresholds and contains provisions that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments, including acquisitions and transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or other encumbrances on our assets;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nenter into contingent obligations;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations; and\n\u2022\npay dividends.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which could trigger acceleration of indebtedness under the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility. In addition, these provisions may limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. In addition, they may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer, if any, restrictions or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as significant acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of the Lenders, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction. The Lenders may accelerate payment of the amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, which would include consummation of the Offer. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement with Stryker, we must obtain a waiver from the Lenders of any default under\nthe Credit Agreement in connection with the proposed Acquisition or repay all amounts owed under the Credit Agreement and terminate the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement involves additional risks that may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAvailability under the ABL Facility is based on the amount of certain eligible receivables, eligible equipment, eligible inventory and eligible surgical instrumentation less specified reserves as described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our access to credit under the ABL Facility is potentially subject to fluctuations depending on the value of the eligible assets in the borrowing base as of any valuation date. Our inability to borrow additional amounts under the ABL Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, all payments on our accounts receivable are required under the Credit Agreement to be directed to deposit accounts under the control of the ABL Facility agent for application to amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility. The Lenders may exercise control over such amounts when they are entitled to exercise default remedies, which may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility bears interest at variable rates, which subjects us to interest rate risk and could increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness. The impact of increases in interest rates could be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our indebtedness, thereby affecting our profitability. In the event of a default under any of our other material debt instruments, the lenders under the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility may terminate their commitments to lend additional money and declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, a default under the Credit Agreement could result in a cross-default under the Notes. While an event of default is continuing under the Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder may elect to increase the rates at which interest accrues. Subject to certain exceptions, amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of our company and borrower. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Lenders under the Credit Agreement could seek to enforce security interests in our assets securing our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, including restricting our access to collections on our accounts receivable. Any acceleration of amounts due under our Credit Agreement or the exercise by the lenders thereto of their rights under the security documents, would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the ABL Facility is subject to market deterioration or other factors that could jeopardize the counterparty obligations of one or more of the Lenders, which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are not able to replace such ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility or find other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.\nHedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our Notes may affect the value of our ordinary shares.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our ordinary shares upon conversion of the Notes and the potential cash outlay from the cash conversion of the Notes. We also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions.\nIn connection with the hedge and warrant transactions associated with the Notes, these financial institutions purchased our ordinary shares in secondary market transactions and entered into various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our ordinary shares. These entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the Notes by purchasing and selling our ordinary shares, other of our securities, or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. Any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares and, as a result, the number and value of the ordinary shares holders will receive upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, subject to movement in the price of our ordinary shares, if the hedge transactions settle in our favor, we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party. The strike prices of the Notes hedges and exercise prices of the warrants are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including in connection with the Offer. If any of the participants in the hedge transactions is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations for any reason, we would not be able to receive the benefit of such transaction. We cannot provide any assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the participants in the hedge transactions.\nRating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the Notes or the Credit Agreement that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our ordinary shares.\nWe have not requested a rating of the Notes or the Credit Agreement from any rating agency, and we do not anticipate that the Notes or the Credit Agreement will be rated. However, if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the Notes or the Credit Agreement and assigns the Notes or the Credit Agreement a rating lower than the rating expected by investors, or reduces such rating in the future, the market price or liquidity of the Notes and our ordinary shares could be harmed. Should a decline in the market price of the Notes, as compared to the price of our ordinary shares, occur, this may trigger the right of the holders of the Notes to convert such Notes into cash and our ordinary shares, as applicable.\nWe may need additional financing to satisfy our anticipated future liquidity requirements or to make opportunistic acquisitions, which financing may not be available on favorable terms at the time it is needed and which could reduce our operational and strategic flexibility.\nAlthough it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $166.9 million, the $154.3 million in availability under the ABL Facility and the $35 million available under the Term Loan Facility, as of December 29, 2019, will be sufficient for the next 12 months to fund our working capital requirements and operations, permit anticipated capital expenditures in 2020 of approximately $80.0 million, pay retained metal-on-metal product and other liabilities of the OrthoRecon business, including without limitation amounts under the MSA and Second Settlement Agreements, net of insurance recoveries, fund contingent consideration, and meet our other anticipated contractual cash obligations in 2020.\nIn the event that we would require additional working capital to fund future operations, we could seek to acquire that through increasing the revolving line of credit under the ABL Facility by up to an additional $75.0 million, borrowing the remaining $35.0 million under the Term Loan Facility or additional equity or debt financing arrangements which may or may not be available on favorable terms at such time. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve additional covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt, in addition to those under our existing indentures and the Credit Agreement. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements, or we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or scale back our operations.\nIf we lose one of our key suppliers, we may be unable to meet customer orders for our products in a timely manner or within our budget, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain of the components and materials used in our products. Our reconstructive joint devices are produced from various surgical grades of titanium, cobalt chrome, stainless steel, various grades of high-density polyethylenes and ceramics. We rely on one source to supply us with a certain grade of cobalt chrome alloy, one supplier for the silicone elastomer used in some of our extremities products, one supplier for our pyrocarbon products, and one supplier to provide a key ingredient of AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft. The manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, and our business could suffer if a sole source supply arrangement is unexpectedly terminated or interrupted, and we are unable to obtain an acceptable new source of supply in a timely fashion.\nIn April 2016, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. pursuant to which Fujifilm agreed to manufacture and sell to us and we agreed to purchase recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF-BB) for use in AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft. The agreement reflects the culmination of a technology transfer from our former supplier to Fujifilm which began in December 2013 when we were notified that our former supplier was exiting the rhPDGF-BB business. Pursuant to our supply agreement with Fujifilm, commercial production of rhPDGF-BB is expected to begin in 2020. Although we believe that our current supply of rhPDGF-BB from our former supplier should be sufficient to last until after rhPDGF-BB becomes available under the new agreement, no assurance can be provided that it will be sufficient. In addition, since Fujifilm has not previously manufactured rhPDGF-BB, its ability to do so and perform its obligations under the agreement are not yet fully proven.\nOur biologic product line includes one current supplier for our GRAFTJACKET\u00ae family of soft tissue repair and graft containment products. We had previously contracted with two suppliers for this product, but ended our relationship with one of the suppliers at the end of 2019. We can continue selling the remaining inventory from this supplier until the inventory is depleted. In addition, certain biologic products depend upon a single supplier as our source for demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and cancellous bone matrix (CBM), and any failure to obtain DBM and CBM from this source in a timely manner will deplete levels of on-hand raw materials inventory and could interfere with our ability to process and distribute allograft products. We rely on a single not-for-profit tissue bank to meet all of our DBM and CBM order requirements, a key component in the allograft products we currently produce, market, and distribute. In addition, we rely on a single supplier of soft tissue graft for BIOTAPE\u00ae XM and a single supplier for the calcium sulfate used in our PRO-DENSE\u2122 Injectable Regenerative Graft (PRO-DENSE\u2122). We cannot be sure that our supply of these single source materials will continue to be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs, or that future suppliers of such materials will be free from FDA regulatory action impacting their sale of such materials. As there are a small number of suppliers, if we cannot continue to obtain such materials from our current sources in volumes sufficient to meet our needs, we may not be able to locate replacement sources of such materials on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This could interrupt our business, which could adversely affect our sales.\nSuppliers of raw materials and components may decide, or be required, for reasons beyond our control to cease supplying raw materials and components to us. FDA regulations may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new\nsuppliers prior to our use of these materials or components, and in the case of a device with a PMA application, we may be required to obtain prior FDA permission, either of which could delay or prevent our access to or use of such raw materials or components.\nWe incur significant expenditures of resources to maintain relatively high levels of instruments, and we historically have had a high level of inventory, which can adversely affect our operating results and reduce our cash flows.\nThe nature of our business requires us to maintain a certain level of instruments since in order to market effectively we often must maintain and bring our customers instrument kits. In addition, we historically have maintained extra inventory in the form of back-up products and products of different sizes in order to ensure that our customers have the right products when they need them. This practice has resulted in us maintaining a relatively high level of inventory, which can adversely affect our operating results and reduce our cash flows. In addition, to the extent that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory.\nFrom time to time, we may experience inventory shortages of some of our higher demand products, which could adversely affect our net sales and operating results.\nFrom time to time, internal or external supply constraints may create temporary shortages of certain of our higher demand products. While these shortages are likely to be temporary and are usually resolved, no assurance can be provided that such inventory shortages will not occur in the future, and if they occur, would not adversely affect our future net sales and operating results.\nIf we fail to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected, and we may not achieve future growth.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological change. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products for use by our customers. Many of the companies developing or marketing competitive products enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including greater financial and human resources for product development and sales and marketing; greater name recognition; established relationships with surgeons, hospitals and third-party payors; broader product lines and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and established sales and marketing and distribution networks. Some of our competitors have indicated an increased focus on the extremities and biologics markets, which are our primary strategic focus. Our competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than us, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for competing products more rapidly than us, develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive or acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Not all of our sales and other personnel have non-compete agreements. We also compete with other organizations in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, and management personnel. If our competitors are more successful than us in these matters, we may be unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors. In addition, the orthopaedic industry has been subject to increasing consolidation recently and over the last few years. Consolidation in our industry not involving our company could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We may be unable to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products, or our products could become obsolete, and our business would suffer.\nWe are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs, and new products represent a significant component of our sales growth rate. We may be unable to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep up with existing or new products and technologies in the orthopaedic market. If we do not continue to introduce new products and technologies, or if those products and technologies are not accepted, we may not be successful. Moreover, research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material, or innovation. Demand for our products also could change in ways we may not anticipate due to evolving customer needs, changing demographics, slow industry growth rates, declines in the extremities and biologics market, the introduction of new products and technologies, evolving surgical philosophies, and evolving industry standards, among others. Additionally, our competitors\u2019 new products and technologies may beat our products to market, may be more effective or less expensive than our products, or may render our products obsolete. Our new products and technologies also could reduce demand for our existing products or render them obsolete and thus adversely affect sales of our existing products and lead to increased expense for excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur business plan relies on certain assumptions about the markets for our products, which, if incorrect, may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe believe that the aging of the general population and increasingly active lifestyles will continue and that these trends will increase the need for our extremities and biologics products. The projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of our products by the medical community prove to be incorrect or do not materialize, or if non-surgical treatments gain more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopaedic implants.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development, pre-clinical testing, and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. U.S. and foreign regulations govern the testing, marketing, registration and sale of medical devices, in addition to regulating manufacturing practices, reporting, labeling, relationships with healthcare professionals, and recordkeeping procedures. The regulatory process requires significant time, effort, and expense to bring our products to market, and we cannot be assured that any of our products will be approved. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in governmental authorities:\n\u2022\nimposing fines and penalties on us;\n\u2022\npreventing us from manufacturing or selling our products;\n\u2022\nbringing civil or criminal charges against us and our officers and employees;\n\u2022\ndelaying the introduction of our new products into the market;\n\u2022\nrecalling or seizing our products; or\n\u2022\nwithdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products.\nEven if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted, this could result in limitations on the uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted. Further, for a marketed product, its manufacturer, such manufacturer\u2019s suppliers, and manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic review and inspection. Subsequent discovery of problems with a product, manufacturer, or facility may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market or other enforcement actions. Our products can only be marketed in accordance with their approved labeling. If we were to promote the use of our products in an \u201coff-label\u201d manner, we and our directors, officers and employees, would be subject to civil and criminal sanctions.\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims laws, anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Violations of these laws can result in criminal and/or civil punishment, including fines, imprisonment and, in the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Greater scrutiny of marketing practices in our industry has resulted in numerous government investigations by various government authorities and this industry-wide enforcement activity is expected to continue. If a governmental authority were to determine that we do not comply with these laws and regulations, then we and our directors, officers and employees could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, including exclusion from participation in U.S. federal healthcare reimbursement programs.\nIn order to market our devices in the member countries of the European Union, we are required to comply with the European Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE mark certification. CE mark certification is the European symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Device Directives. Under the European Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices including active implants must qualify for CE marking. Our failure to comply with the European Medical Devices Directive could result in our loss of CE mark certification which would harm our business. In 2017, the European Commission adopted the Medical Devices Regulation, which will replace the European Medical Devices Directive and will be implemented beginning in May 2020. The Medical Devices Regulation will impose additional and/or more stringent approval requirements on medical device manufacturers. These new rules and procedures may result in increased regulatory oversight of any future devices that we may develop and may increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to maintain or place devices in the member countries of the European Union. In addition, we anticipate having to expend significant time, costs and resources to comply with the new European Medical Devices Directive.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anticorruption laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur international operations expose us to legal and regulatory risks. These risks include the risk that our international distributors could engage in conduct violative of U.S. or local laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Our U.S. operations, including those of our U.S. operating subsidiaries, are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly-\ntraded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anti-corruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. We either operate or plan to operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, and we utilize a number of third-party sales representatives for whose actions we could be held liable under the FCPA. We inform our personnel and third-party sales representatives of the requirements of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, including, but not limited to their reporting requirements. We also have developed and will continue to develop and implement systems for formalizing contracting processes, performing due diligence on agents, and improving our recordkeeping and auditing practices regarding these regulations. However, there is no guarantee that our employees, third-party sales representatives, or other agents have not or will not engage in conduct undetected by our processes and for which we might be held responsible under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. Failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf our employees, third-party sales representatives, or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions. Investigations of companies in our industry by the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice have focused on potential FCPA violations in connection with the sale of medical devices in foreign countries. We believe we have compliance systems that enable us to prevent these behaviors. However, if despite our efforts we are not successful in mitigating these risks, we could become the target of enforcement actions by U.S. or local authorities. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nCertain foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to prohibitions as strict as those under the FCPA or, even if subjected to strict prohibitions, such prohibitions may be laxly enforced in practice. If our competitors engage in corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft, or other fraudulent practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business, or from government officials, who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage.\nAllegations of wrongdoing by the United States Department of Justice and Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and related publicity could lead to further governmental investigations or actions by other third parties.\nAs a result of the allegations of wrongdoing made by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and the publicity surrounding legacy Wright\u2019s settlement with the United States Department of Justice and OIG-HHS, and amendments to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement and Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA), other governmental agencies, including state authorities, could conduct investigations or institute proceedings that are not precluded by the terms of settlements reflected in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement and the CIA. In August 2012, legacy Wright received a subpoena from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Tennessee requesting records and documentation relating to the PROFEMUR\u00ae series of hip replacement devices for the period from January 1, 2000 to August 2, 2012. These interactions with the authorities could increase our exposure to lawsuits by potential whistleblowers, including under the U.S. Federal False Claims Act, based on new theories or allegations arising from the allegations made by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey. The costs of defending or resolving any such investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nModifications to our marketed devices may require FDA regulatory clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until such additional clearances or approvals are obtained.\nThe FDA requires device manufacturers to make a determination of whether or not a modification to a cleared and commercialized medical device requires a new approval or clearance. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision not to submit for additional approvals or clearances. Any modification to an FDA approved or cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new PMA or 510(k) clearance and could be considered misbranded if the modified device is commercialized and such additional approval or clearance was not obtained. We cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our decisions not to seek approvals or clearances for particular device modifications or that we will be successful in obtaining additional approvals or 510(k) clearances for modifications.\nWe obtained 510(k) premarket clearance for certain devices we market or marketed in the United States. We have subsequently modified some of those devices or device labeling since obtaining 510(k) clearance under the view that these modifications did not significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device, and did not require new approvals or clearances. If the FDA disagrees with our decisions and requires us to obtain additional premarket approvals or 510(k) clearances for any modifications to our\nproducts and we fail to obtain such approvals or clearances or fail to secure approvals or clearances in a timely manner, we may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing the modified device or to recall such modified device until we obtain FDA approval or clearance and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe European Union and many of its world markets rely on the CE Mark as the path to market our products. Our loss of the CE Mark would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn order to market our devices in the member countries of the European Union (EU), we are required to comply with the European Medical Devices Directive, which requires our devices to meet specific quality program criteria and technical documentation standards, before obtaining the CE Mark certification that is required to market our products in the EU. Additionally, the European Medical Device Directive requires that many of our products that bear the CE Mark be supported by post-market clinical data. We are in the process of implementing systems and procedures to control this activity in order to comply with these requirements, including establishing contractual relationships with the healthcare provider clinical study sites in accordance with our internal compliance requirements. We intend to obtain the needed clinical data to support our marketed products, but there can be no assurance that European regulators will accept the results. Our failure to comply with the European Medical Devices Directive could result in our failure to obtain CE Mark certification for new devices or our loss of existing device CE mark certification, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us and our business.\nIn March 2017, the European Commission adopted the Medical Devices Regulation, which will replace the European Medical Devices Directive and will be implemented beginning in May 2020. The Medical Devices Regulation will impose additional and/or more stringent approval requirements on medical device manufacturers. These new rules and procedures may result in increased regulatory oversight of any future devices that we may develop and may increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to maintain or place devices in the member countries of the European Union. Additionally, we anticipate having to expend significant time, costs and resources to comply with the Medical Devices Regulation.\nOur biologics business is subject to emerging governmental regulations that can significantly impact our business.\nThe FDA has statutory authority to regulate allograft-based products, processing, and materials. The FDA, European Union and Health Canada have been working to establish more comprehensive regulatory frameworks for allograft-based, tissue-containing products, which are principally derived from cadaveric tissue. The framework developed by the FDA establishes risk-based criteria for determining whether a particular human tissue-based product will be classified as human tissue, a medical device, or a biologic drug requiring 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. All tissue-based products are subject to extensive FDA regulation, including establishment of registration requirements, product listing requirements, good tissue practice requirements for manufacturing, and screening requirements that ensure that diseases are not transmitted to tissue recipients. The FDA has also proposed extensive additional requirements addressing sub-contracted tissue services, traceability to the recipient/patient, and donor records review. If a tissue-based product is considered human tissue, FDA requirements focus on preventing the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases to recipients. Clinical data or review of safety and efficacy is not required before the tissue can be marketed. However, if tissue is considered a medical device or biologic drug, then FDA clearance or approval is required.\nAdditionally, our biologics business involves the procurement and transplantation of allograft tissue, which is subject to federal regulation under the NOTA. NOTA prohibits the sale of human organs, including bone and other human tissue, for valuable consideration within the meaning of NOTA. NOTA permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of human tissue. We currently charge our customers for these expenses. In the future, if NOTA is amended or reinterpreted, we may not be able to charge these expenses to our customers, and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur principal allograft-based biologics offerings include ALLOMATRIX\u00ae, GRAFTJACKET\u00ae and IGNITE\u00ae products.\nOur business could suffer if the medical community does not continue to accept allograft technology.\nNew allograft products, technologies, and enhancements may never achieve broad market acceptance due to numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nlack of clinical acceptance of allograft products and related technologies;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of competitive tissue repair treatment options that render allograft products and technologies too expensive and obsolete;\n\u2022\nlack of available third-party reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe inability to train surgeons in the use of allograft products and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe risk of disease transmission; and\n\u2022\nethical concerns about the commercial aspects of harvesting cadaveric tissue.\nMarket acceptance also will depend on the ability to demonstrate that existing and new allograft products and technologies are attractive alternatives to existing tissue repair treatment options. To demonstrate this, we rely upon surgeon evaluations of the clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, and cost effectiveness of our tissue repair options and technologies.\nRecommendations and endorsements by influential surgeons are important to the commercial success of allograft products and technologies. In addition, several countries, notably Japan, prohibit the use of allografts. If allograft products and technologies are not broadly accepted in the marketplace, we may not achieve a competitive position in the market.\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, and failures of, interruptions to, or unauthorized tampering with those systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business. In addition, we continue to grow in part through strategic business combinations and acquisitions. As a result of these transactions, we may face risks due to implementation, modification, or remediation of the IT controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired businesses. We continue to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate into one enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and plan to continue to otherwise upgrade and expand our IT system capabilities. We may experience difficulties in our business operations, or difficulties in operating our business under the ERP, either of which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, and otherwise adequately service our customers, and lead to increased costs and other difficulties. In the event we experience significant disruptions as a result of the ERP implementation or otherwise, we may not be able to fix our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate timely, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our customers, suppliers and third-party service providers, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of any underlying information and data. We have programs, processes and technologies in place to prevent, detect, contain, respond to and mitigate security related threats and potential incidents. We regularly undertake improvements to our IT systems in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect, anticipating, identifying or preventing these intrusions or mitigating them if and when they occur, may be challenging. Our IT systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology and regulatory standards. We also outsource certain elements of our IT systems to third parties that, as a result of this outsourcing, could have access to certain confidential information and whose systems may also be vulnerable to these types of attacks or disruptions. There can be no assurance that our protective measures or those of these third parties will prevent or detect security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. The failure of these systems to operate or integrate effectively with other internal, customer, supplier or third-party service provider systems and to protect the underlying IT system and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches or unauthorized access of these systems, or any failure by us to remediate any such attacks or breaches, may also result in damage to our reputation or competitiveness, delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nOur inability to maintain effective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of combined or acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement, and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in light of anticipated changes in accounting standards and in the context of acquisitions of other businesses.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subjected to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation, the defense of any of which could cause the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, we could incur significant legal and other expenses, and we could be required to pay damages to settle such actions if any such actions were not resolved in our favor. Continued or future failure to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting could also result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that will impair our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately or on a\ntimely basis. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares and our access to capital.\nWe operate in markets outside the United States that are subject to political, economic, and social instability and expose us to additional risks.\nOperations in countries outside of the United States accounted for approximately 23% of our net sales for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Our operations outside of the United States are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales operations. Our international sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations on orthopaedic implants and biologic products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal from or revision to international trade policies or agreements and the imposition or increases in import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, import and export quotas and other trade restrictions, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with that country, company, person, or entity;\n\u2022\neconomic instability, including currency risk between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, in our target markets;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities, which could result in significant fines, penalties, and additional taxes being imposed upon us;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increases in infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology;\n\u2022\na shortage of high-quality international salespeople and distributors;\n\u2022\nloss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge or are otherwise important to our success in international markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in third-party reimbursement policy that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate our reducing selling prices for our products;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and other trade restrictions, particularly related to the exportation of our biologic products, and including the current U.S. trade dispute with China;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or strikes in the healthcare industry, such as those that have affected our operations in France, Canada, South Korea, and Finland in the past;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the Netherlands;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nnational and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes, acts of war or terrorist acts;\n\u2022\ncomplex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws; and\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in approximately 50 countries.\nIn addition, in June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally gave notice of its intent to withdraw from the European Union. Serving this notice began a more than two-year period during which the United Kingdom and the European Union negotiated the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Unable to reach an agreement or further extend the deadline for withdrawal, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union without an agreement in place. It is possible that, following this withdrawal, there will be greater restrictions on the movement of goods and people between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could affect our ability to sell our products in certain European Union countries. The withdrawal could also adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and Euro. We do not know to what extent these changes will impact our business, especially considering we have a sales office in the United Kingdom and in 2019, approximately 90% of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies were derived from European Union countries. Any of these\neffects of Brexit, and others that we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. In addition, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to continuing membership with the European Union. At this time, it is not certain what steps may be taken to facilitate the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, which has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear how the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSince we conduct operations through U.S. operating subsidiaries, not only are we subject to the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions, but we also are subject to U.S. laws governing our activities in foreign countries, such as the FCPA, as well as various import-export laws, regulations, and embargoes. If our business activities were determined to violate these laws, regulations, or rules, we could suffer serious consequences.\nHealthcare regulation and reimbursement for medical devices vary significantly from country to country. This changing environment could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in some jurisdictions.\nThe costs of complying with the requirements of the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn May 2018, the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective, replacing the data protection laws of each EU member state. The GDPR implemented more stringent operational requirements for personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by European Data Protection Authorities, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have spent and expect to continue to expend significant time, costs and resources to comply with the GDPR.\nWorldwide economic instability could adversely affect our net sales, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe health of the global economy, and the credit markets and the financial services industry in particular, affects our business and operating results. While the health of the credit markets and the financial services industry appears to have stabilized, there is no assurance that it will remain stable, and there can be no assurance that there will not be deterioration in the global economy. If the credit markets are not favorable, we may be unable to raise additional financing when needed or on favorable terms. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any economic crisis could also adversely impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with materials and components, either of which may negatively impact our business. As with our customers and vendors, these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Further, there are concerns for the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency, given the economic and political challenges facing individual Eurozone countries and Brexit. Continuing deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Eurozone countries, the withdrawal of one or more member countries from the European Union, or the failure of the Euro as a common European currency could adversely affect our sales, financial condition, or operating results.\nThe collectability of our accounts receivable may be affected by general economic conditions.\nOur liquidity is dependent on, among other things, the collection of our accounts receivable. Collections of our receivables may be affected by general economic conditions. Although current economic conditions have not had a material adverse effect on our ability to collect such receivables, we can make no assurances regarding future economic conditions or their effect on our ability to collect our receivables, particularly from our international stocking distributors. In addition, some of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries (including, but not limited to, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain). Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries. In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located outside of the United States. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our product sales are made through independent distributors and sales agents who we do not control.\nA significant portion of our product sales are made through independent sales representatives and distributors. Because the independent distributor often controls the customer relationships within its territory (and, in certain countries outside the United States, the regulatory relationship), there is a risk that if our relationship with the distributor ends, our relationship with the customer\nwill be lost (and, in certain countries outside the United States, that we could experience delays in amending or transferring our product registrations). Also, because we do not control a distributor\u2019s field sales agents, there is a risk we will be unable to ensure that our sales processes, compliance, and other priorities will be consistently communicated and executed by the distributor. If we fail to maintain relationships with our key distributors, or fail to ensure that our distributors adhere to our sales processes, compliance, and other priorities, this could have an adverse effect on our operations. Changes to or turnover within our independent distributor organization or transitions to direct selling models also could adversely affect our business if these transitions are not managed effectively. Additionally, the terms of our distributor agreements or local laws could make it difficult for us to exit a distribution arrangement we no longer find favorable. Further, the legacy independent distributors and sales agents of companies we have acquired may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us. A loss of a significant number of our distributors or agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our success is partially dependent upon our ability to retain and motivate our distributors, independent sales agencies, and their representatives to sell our products in certain territories. They may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans. Some of our distributors and independent sales agencies do not sell our products exclusively and may offer similar products from other orthopaedic companies. Our distributors and independent sales agencies may terminate their contracts with us, may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products, or may focus their sales efforts on other products that produce greater commissions for them, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and operating results.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nOur ongoing research and development, pre-clinical testing, and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. We are currently conducting post-market clinical studies of some of our products to gather additional information about these products\u2019 safety, efficacy, or optimal use. In the future, we may conduct additional clinical trials to support approval of new products. Clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations or the FDA may take enforcement action. The data collected from these clinical trials may ultimately be used to support market approval or clearance for these products or gather additional information about approved or cleared products. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not always ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product\u2019s profile.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain, or in some cases, maintain regulatory clearance or approval for or commercialize our products.\nWe often must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators, and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our pre-clinical and clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain or, in some cases maintain, regulatory clearance or approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results, and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nFluctuations in insurance cost and availability could adversely affect our profitability or our risk management profile.\nWe hold a number of insurance policies, including product liability insurance, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, property insurance, and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage should increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if any of our current insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers.\nOur inability to maintain contractual relationships with healthcare professionals could have a negative impact on our research and development and medical education programs.\nWe maintain contractual relationships with respected surgeons and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development and in the training of surgeons on the safe and effective use of our products. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing\nproduct lines as well as providing high quality training on those products. If we are unable to enter into and maintain these relationships, our ability to develop and market new and improved products and train on the use of those products could decrease, and our future operating results could be unfavorably affected. In addition, it is possible that U.S. federal and state and international laws requiring us to disclose payments or other transfers of value, such as free gifts or meals, to surgeons and other healthcare providers could have a chilling effect on these relationships with individuals or entities that may, among other things, want to avoid public scrutiny of their financial relationships with us.\nIf adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors for our products are not obtained, surgeons and patients may be reluctant to use our products and our sales may decline.\nIn the United States, healthcare providers who purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors, principally U.S. federally-funded Medicare, state-funded Medicaid, and private health insurance plans, to pay for all or a portion of the cost of joint reconstructive procedures and products utilized in those procedures. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement. Our sales depend largely on governmental healthcare programs and private health insurers reimbursing patients\u2019 medical expenses. Surgeons, hospitals, and other healthcare providers may elect not to purchase our products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our products. In light of healthcare reform measures, payors continue to review their coverage policies for existing and new therapies and may deny or restrict coverage for treatments that include the use of our products.\nIn addition, some healthcare providers in the United States have adopted or are considering new payment models such as bundled payment methodologies and/or managed care systems in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare on a fixed cost per person basis or on other \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d bases where reimbursement may depend on cost savings achieved. Healthcare providers and/or payors may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures, including joint reconstructive surgeries, or by requiring the use of the least expensive implant available. Changes in reimbursement methodologies, policies or healthcare cost containment initiatives that limit or restrict reimbursement for our products may cause our sales to decline or could impact the prices we are able to charge for our products.\nIf adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors outside of the United States are not obtained, international sales of our products may decline. Outside of the United States, reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for medical devices and procedures. Canada, and some European and Asian countries, in particular France, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, have tightened reimbursement rates. Additionally, Brazil, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom have recently begun landmark reforms that will significantly alter their healthcare systems. Finally, some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods.\nOur business could be significantly and adversely impacted by healthcare reform legislation.\nComprehensive healthcare reform legislation has significantly and adversely impacted our business, and uncertainty regarding future healthcare reform legislation could further adversely impact our business. For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) imposed a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of medical devices, which tax was repealed effective as of December 31, 2019 following the end of the moratorium that had been imposed. On December 14, 2018, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a ruling declaring that, because the individual mandate is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA and was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety. The ruling is subject to appeal, and the ACA will remain in effect pending the appeal. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. The ACA includes numerous provisions to limit Medicare spending through reductions in various fee schedule payments and by instituting more sweeping payment reforms, such as bundled payments for episodes of care and the establishment of \u201caccountable care organizations\u201d under which hospitals and physicians would be able to share savings that result from cost control efforts. Many of these provisions were not yet fully implemented at the time of the District Court\u2019s ruling, and their impact on our business cannot be fully known until and unless they are implemented. If the ACA is ultimately upheld, these and other provisions of the law could adversely impact our business. In addition, the constitutionality of the ACA may not be affirmed on appeal or it could be replaced by new healthcare reform legislation. A repeal of the ACA or any replacement or material modification of the ACA could cause significant uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare market, could increase our costs, decrease our sales or inhibit our ability to sell our products. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict with certainty the impact that these U.S. federal and state health reforms will have on us. However, an expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for products, reduce medical procedure volumes, and adversely affect our business and operating results, possibly materially.\nWe are also subject to certain data privacy and security regulation by both the U.S. federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. There is an increasing trend for more criminal prosecutions and compliance enforcement activities for noncompliance with HIPAA as well as for data breaches involving protected health information (PHI). In the ordinary course of\nour business, we may receive PHI. If we are unable to comply with HIPAA or experience a data breach involving PHI, we could be subject to criminal and civil sanctions.\nIf we cannot retain our key personnel, we may be unable to manage and operate our business successfully and meet our strategic objectives.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain and motivate key managerial, scientific, sales, and technical personnel, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. We compete for such personnel with other companies, academic institutions, governmental entities, and other organizations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future. Key personnel may depart because of difficulties with change or a desire not to remain with our company, especially in the case of employees of acquired companies. Any unanticipated loss or interruption of services of our management team and our key personnel could significantly reduce our ability to meet our strategic objectives because it may not be possible for us to find appropriate replacement personnel should the need arise. Loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully. Further, any inability on our part to enforce non-compete or non-solicitation arrangements related to key personnel who have left the business could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster adversely affects our manufacturing facilities or distribution channels, we could be unable to manufacture or distribute our products for a substantial amount of time, and our sales could be disrupted.\nWe principally rely on five manufacturing facilities, one of which is in France, one of which is in Ireland, two of which are in Tennessee, and one of which is in Georgia. The facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. For example, the machinery associated with our manufacturing of pyrocarbon in one of our French facilities is highly specialized and would take substantial lead-time and resources to replace. We also maintain a facility in Bloomington, Minnesota, a facility in Arlington, Tennessee, and a warehouse in Montbonnot, France, which contain large amounts of our inventory. Our facilities, warehouses, or distribution channels may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. For example, in the event of a natural or man-made disaster at one of our warehouses, we may lose substantial amounts of inventory that would be difficult to replace. Our manufacturing facility in Arlington, Tennessee is located near the New Madrid fault line. In the event our facilities, warehouses, or distribution channels are affected by a disaster, we would be forced to rely on, among others, third-party manufacturers and alternative warehouse space and distribution channels, which may or may not be available, and our sales could decline. Although we believe we have adequate disaster recovery plans in place and possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, such plans and insurance may not cover such disasters or be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported net sales and earnings.\nBecause a majority of our international sales are denominated in local currencies and not in U.S. dollars, our reported net sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted our net sales by $9.0 million during 2019. Operating costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies, thereby partially limiting our transaction risk exposure. However, cost of sales related to these sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars; therefore, as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the gross margin associated with our sales denominated in foreign currencies declines.\nAlthough we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and in the past through hedging activities, these actions may not prove to be fully effective, and hedging activities, if we choose to engage in them, involve additional risks.\nWe may be unable to maintain competitive global cash management and a competitive effective corporate tax rate.\nWe cannot give any assurance as to our future effective tax rate because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate and uncertainty regarding the level of net income that we will earn in those jurisdictions in the future. Additionally, the tax laws of the Netherlands, the United States, France and other jurisdictions in which we operate could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.\nOur provision for income taxes will be based on certain estimates and assumptions made by management in consultation with our tax and other advisors. Our group income tax rate will be affected by, among other factors, the amount of net income earned in our various operating jurisdictions, the continued availability of benefits under tax treaties, the rates of taxes payable in respect of that income, and withholding taxes on payments from one jurisdiction to the next. We will enter into many transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course of business in respect of which the tax treatment is not entirely certain. We will, therefore, make estimates and judgments based on our knowledge and understanding of applicable tax laws and tax treaties, and the application of those tax laws and tax treaties to our business, in determining our consolidated tax provision. For example, certain countries could seek to tax a greater share of income than will be provided for by us. The final outcome of any audits by taxation authorities\nmay differ from the estimates and assumptions we may use in determining our consolidated tax provisions and accruals. This could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated income tax provision, financial condition, and the net income for the period in which such determinations are made.\nIn particular, dividends, distributions, and other intra-group payments from our U.S. affiliates to certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% unless the entity receiving such payments can demonstrate that it qualifies for reduction or elimination of the U.S. withholding tax under the income tax treaty (if any) between the United States and the jurisdiction in which the entity is organized or is a tax resident. In certain cases, treaty qualification may depend on whether at least 50% of our ultimate beneficial owners are qualified residents of the United States or the treaty jurisdiction within the meaning of the applicable treaty. There can be no assurance that we will satisfy this beneficial ownership requirement at the time when such dividends, distributions, or other payments are made. Moreover, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may challenge our determination that the beneficial ownership requirement is satisfied. If we do not satisfy the beneficial ownership requirement, such dividends, distributions, or other payments may be subject to 30% U.S. withholding tax.\nWe may face potential limitations on the utilization of our U.S. tax attributes.\nFollowing the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a non-U.S. corporation, Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code) can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses and certain tax credits to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions. Based on the limited guidance available, we currently expect that this limitation likely will not apply to us and as a result, our U.S. affiliates likely will not be limited by Section 7874 of the Code in their ability to utilize their U.S. tax attributes to offset their U.S. taxable income, if any, resulting from certain specified taxable transactions. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. If, however, Section 7874 of the Code were to apply to the Wright/Tornier merger and if our U.S. affiliates engage in transactions that would generate U.S. taxable income subject to this limitation in the future, it could take us longer to use our net operating losses and tax credits and, thus, we could pay U.S. federal income tax sooner than we otherwise would have. Additionally, if the limitation were to apply and if we do not generate taxable income consistent with our expectations, it is possible that the limitation under Section 7874 on the utilization of U.S. tax attributes could prevent our U.S. affiliates from fully utilizing their U.S. tax attributes prior to their expiration.\nFuture changes to U.S. tax laws could materially affect us, including our status as a non-U.S. corporation.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation generally will be considered to be resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes in its place of organization or incorporation. Accordingly, under the generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, we, as a Netherlands incorporated entity, would be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, not a U.S. tax resident). Section 7874 of Code, however, contains specific rules (more fully discussed below) that can cause a non-U.S. corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These rules are complex and there is little or no guidance as to their application.\nWe currently expect we should continue to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, however, it is possible that the IRS could disagree with that position and assert that Section 7874 applies to treat us as a U.S. corporation. In addition, new statutory or regulatory provisions under Section 7874 or otherwise could be enacted or promulgated that adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such provisions could have retroactive application. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we would be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on our worldwide income, and the income of our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the U.S. tax rules for controlled foreign subsidiaries. In such a case, we would be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated. Moreover, in such a case, a non-U.S. shareholder of our company would be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends paid by us to such shareholder.\nAny such U.S. corporate income or withholding tax could be imposed in addition to, rather than in lieu of, any Dutch corporate income tax or withholding tax that may apply.\nOur tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations, or by increased scrutiny by tax authorities.\nRecent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, limit the ability of foreign-owned corporations to deduct interest expense, and make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the statute commonly called the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the 2017 Tax Act) which enacts a broad range of changes to the Code. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of U.S. interest and U.S. net operating losses, allows for the expensing of certain U.S. capital expenditures, and puts into effect a number of changes impacting applicable operations outside of the United States including, but not limited to, the imposition of a onetime tax on accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income that has not previously been subject to tax, and modifications to the treatment of certain intercompany transactions. We are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. There can be no assurance\nthat changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the United States, the Netherlands and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could impact the expected tax treatment for us and adversely affect our financial results.\nMoreover, U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies involved or recently involved in cross-border business combinations, such as us, which may lead such authorities to assert that we owe additional taxes.\nOur exposure to several tax jurisdictions may have an adverse effect on us, and this may increase the aggregate tax burden on us and our shareholders.\nWe are subject to a large number of different tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations are often complex and are subject to varying interpretations. The combined effect of the application of tax laws, including the application or disapplication of tax treaties of one or more of these jurisdictions and their interpretation by the relevant tax authorities could, under certain circumstances, produce contradictory results. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations to determine the existence, scope, and level of our liability to tax in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we take positions in the course of our business with respect to various tax matters, including the compliance with the arm\u2019s length principles in respect of transactions with related parties, the tax deductibility of interest and other costs, and the amount of depreciation or write-down of our assets that we can recognize for tax purposes. There is no assurance that the tax authorities in the relevant jurisdictions will agree with such interpretation of these laws and regulations or with the positions taken by us. If such tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could increase our effective tax rate and cost of operations.\nFurthermore, because we are incorporated under Dutch law, we are treated for Dutch corporate income tax purposes as a resident of the Netherlands. Based on our management structure and the current tax laws of the United States and the Netherlands, as well as applicable income tax treaties and current interpretations thereof, we expect to remain a tax resident solely of the Netherlands. If we were to be treated as a tax resident of a jurisdiction other than or in addition to the Netherlands, we could be subject to corporate income tax in that other jurisdiction, and could be required to withhold tax on any dividends paid by us to our shareholders under the applicable laws of that jurisdiction.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations as a result of our business combination and acquisition transactions.\nAs a result of our prior business combinations and acquisition transactions, the size of our business has increased significantly. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits anticipated from these transactions.\nOur Corporate Compliance Program requires the cooperation of many individuals, involves substantial investment and diverts a significant amount of time and resources from our other business activities. Our failure to maintain an effective Corporate Compliance Program could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial results.\nWe are committed to a robust Corporate Compliance Program. Accordingly, we have devoted and continue to devote a significant amount of time and resources from our financial, human resources, and compliance personnel, as well as all of our employees in furtherance of this strategic objective. Our failure to maintain an effective Corporate Compliance Program could result in significant legal and regulatory problems and could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial results.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of our prior business combinations and acquisitions, which if these acquired businesses do not perform as anticipated, may be subject to future impairment, which would harm our operating results.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had $1.3 billion in goodwill and $257.4 million in intangible assets primarily as a result of our prior business combinations and acquisitions. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets have been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our acquired businesses and technologies could significantly impact\nasset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill. If the operating performance of our acquired businesses and technologies significantly decreases, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates decline, we could be required, under current US GAAP, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. Any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Ordinary Shares and Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nThe trading volume and prices of our ordinary shares have been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to our shareholders.\nThe trading volume and prices of our ordinary shares have been and may continue to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. During 2019, the sale price of our ordinary shares ranged from $19.04 to $32.86. Such volatility may be the result of broad market and industry factors. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our ordinary shares may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe proposed Acquisition and developments in connection therewith affecting the likelihood of completion of the transaction and timing thereof;\n\u2022\nvariations in our net sales, earnings, and cash flow, and in particular variations that deviate from projected financial information;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of divestitures or discontinuance of products or assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of our equity securities by our significant shareholders or management or sales of additional equity securities by our company;\n\u2022\npending and potential litigation or regulatory investigations; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in market prices for our products.\nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares trade. Shareholders of a public company sometimes bring securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the market price of that company\u2019s securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management\u2019s attention and other resources from our business and operations, which could harm our operating results and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares is influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares likely would decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price or trading volume for our ordinary shares to decline.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares could adversely affect their market price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the market price of our ordinary shares.\nRights of a holder of ordinary shares are governed by Dutch law and differ from the rights of shareholders under U.S. law.\nWe are a Dutch public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap). Our corporate affairs and the rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by Dutch law and our articles of association. The rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors may be different from those in companies governed by the laws of U.S. jurisdictions. For example, Dutch law does not provide for a shareholder derivative action. In addition, in the performance of its duties, our board of directors is required by Dutch law to act in the interest of our company and our affiliated business, and to consider the interests of our company, our shareholders, our employees, and other stakeholders, in all cases with reasonableness and fairness. It is possible that some of these parties will have interests that are different from, or in addition to, interests of our shareholders.\nAs a result of different shareholder voting requirements in the Netherlands relative to laws in effect in certain states in the United States, we may have less flexibility with respect to the issuance of our ordinary shares than companies organized in the United States.\nCurrently, our articles of association provide for an authorized share capital consisting of one class of shares, being 320,000,000 ordinary shares, each with a nominal value of \u20ac0.03. Under Dutch law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an amendment to our articles of association. Our articles of association can be amended upon a proposal of our board of directors by the general meeting of shareholders, which resolution can be adopted with a simple majority in a meeting where at least one-third of the outstanding shares are represented. New ordinary shares may be issued pursuant to a resolution of shareholders, or pursuant to such resolution of the board of directors if designated thereto by shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Dutch law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration. The right of our shareholders to subscribe for ordinary shares pursuant to preemptive rights may be limited or restricted by our shareholders, and our shareholders may delegate such authority to the board of directors. Such designations of authority to our board of directors may remain in effect for up to five years and may be renewed for additional periods of up to five years.\nCurrently, our board of directors is authorized to issue until June 28, 2021 up to 20% of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of issue, which is further divided into 10% for general corporate purposes (including potential mergers and acquisitions) and an additional 10% only for potential mergers and acquisitions and to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights in respect of such issue of shares, without further shareholder approval. We cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved on a timely basis. The failure to renew these authorizations on a timely basis could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect our ability to run our business and the holders of our securities.\nU.S. investors may not be able to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters against us or members of our board of directors or officers.\nWe are organized under the laws of the Netherlands, and, as such, the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and the civil liability of our directors are governed by the laws of the Netherlands and our articles of association. The rights of shareholders under the laws of the Netherlands may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. A substantial portion of our assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States on us, or to enforce outside the United States any judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States (including the Netherlands) or enforce claims for punitive damages.\nThe United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (other than arbitral awards). A final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States which is enforceable in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the party in whose favor a final and conclusive judgment of the U.S. court has been rendered will be required to file its claim with a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands. Such party may submit to a Dutch court the final judgment rendered by the U.S. court. If and to the extent that the Dutch court finds that the jurisdiction of the U.S. court has been based on grounds which are internationally acceptable and that proper legal procedures have been observed, the Dutch court will generally tend to give binding effect to the judgment of the court of the United States without substantive re-examination or re-litigation on the merits of the subject matter, unless the judgment contravenes principles of public policy of the Netherlands.\nThere can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors or officers who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our ordinary shares.\nOur articles of association prescribe that profits or reserves appearing from our annual accounts adopted by the general meeting shall be at the disposal of the general meeting. We have power to make distributions to shareholders and other persons entitled to distributable profits only to the extent that our equity exceeds the sum of the paid and called-up portion of the ordinary share capital and the reserves that must be maintained in accordance with provisions of Dutch law or our articles of association. The profits must first be used to set up and maintain reserves required by law and must then be set off against certain financial losses. We may not make any distribution of profits on ordinary shares that we hold. The general meeting, whether or not upon the proposal of our board of directors, determines whether and how much of the remaining profit they will reserve and the manner and date of such distribution. All calculations to determine the amounts available for dividends will be based on our Dutch annual accounts, which may be different from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Beginning with our fiscal year 2015, our statutory accounts have been prepared and we expect will continue to be prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards and are deposited with the Trade Register in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We have not previously\ndeclared or paid cash dividends, and we have no plan to declare or pay any dividends in the near future on our ordinary shares. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.", "PERMNO": 89046, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "WMGI"}
