{"cik": "855612", "company": "ZIX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business, financial condition and financial results. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur business depends upon customers using email and certain social media platforms to exchange confidential information, and a significant shift of those messages to other communication channels could impair our growth prospects and negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur customers deploy and use our products and services to easily, securely and confidentially send and receive electronic messages, by way of internet communications channels including email and certain social media platforms. Our business and revenue substantially depend on our current and potential customers using email and social media to exchange sensitive information electronically. New technologies, products, or business models that could support migration to alternative means of secure communications could be disruptive to our business. If prospective or current customers were to send and receive sensitive information using technology or communication channels other than email or the social media platforms that we support, our growth prospects and our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on market acceptance of our products and services, and our failure to achieve and maintain influential customers could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIn order to continue to operate profitably and grow, we must achieve and maintain broad market acceptance of our products and services at a price that provides us with an acceptable rate of return relative to our costs. We have been successful in selling our Email Encryption products and services to high-profile customers in the healthcare, financial services and government segments of the market. The acceptance and use of our products and services by those significant customers facilitates our sales to other potential customers. The loss of an influential customer of our existing products and services, or the failure to achieve sufficient market adoption of new products including Advanced Email Threat Protection and Information Archive, could impair our ability to expand the market penetration of our products and services, or cause us to reduce or increase prices, which could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on securing new customer subscriptions and subscription renewals from existing customers.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is derived from customer subscriptions, and existing customers have no contractual obligations to purchase beyond the initial subscription or contract period. Our ability to grow our business is dependent in part on customers renewing their existing subscriptions and purchasing additional solutions or services after the initial term of their agreement. Though we maintain and analyze historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals, upgrades and expansions, those rates may not accurately predict future trends in renewal of certain products and services offered by us. If our customers cancel or amend their agreements with us during their term, do not renew their agreements, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional solutions or products during renewal periods, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some level of attrition with existing customers and we may not maintain historical subscription rates, and we may be unable to accurately predict our customer renewal rates. Although we have historically retained approximately 90% of our recurring revenue on an annual basis, there has been some recent decline in such retention and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may further decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of their satisfaction with our products and technical support services, customer merger or acquisition activity, customer budgets, the pricing of our products compared with those offered by our competitors, technology trends, the prevailing regulatory regime and general market conditions. If new subscriptions or subscription renewals decline from their current levels, our revenue or revenue growth may decline, and our business may suffer which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe security of our networks and data centers is critical to our business and an actual or perceived breach of security through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe are dependent on our networks and data centers to provide our products and services. Due to the nature of the products and services we provide and the sensitive nature of the information we collect, process, store, use and transmit, we detect cyber-attacks from unauthorized parties attempting to penetrate our networks and data centers. We are also susceptible to inadvertent data protection breaches, computer viruses and other similar disruptions from process, coding or human error that could harm our networks and data centers. Our business depends on customers having and maintaining confidence that we provide effective network and security protection. To reduce the risk of a successful cyber-attack or similar event, we have implemented significant physical and logical security measures to detect, identify and mitigate threats as well as to monitor for and respond to potential breaches and incidents. Despite these security measures, we may be unable to anticipate malicious techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion and our networks and data centers may remain vulnerable. We may not be able to correct a security flaw or particular vulnerability promptly, or at all. Further efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt or undermine our security efforts may be costly to implement and may not be successful. Also, many of our products are cloud-based, and the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers has been increasing as our business as grown. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of cloud-based products we offer and operate in more countries. Despite the implementation of security measures, if a cyber-attack or other breach of security occurs, or is perceived to have occurred, in our internal systems or at our data centers and networks, it could cause negative publicity, interruption of our services, damage to our reputation, unauthorized disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information (including personally identifiable information), disclosure of our intellectual property, disclosure, modification or removal of our confidential or sensitive information, theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets, loss of customers, lost revenue and increased expense (including potentially indemnification or warranty costs), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIn addition, while we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial results and reputation.\nPublic key and other cryptographic technologies used in our businesses are subject to technology risks that could reduce demand for our products and services and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business employs public key cryptography technology and other encryption technologies to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data. The security afforded by encryption depends on the strength of the private key, which is predicated on the assumption that it is very difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key. Successful decryption of intercepted encrypted email, or public reports of successful decryption, whether or not true, could reduce demand for our products and services. If new methods or technologies, such as quantum computing, make it easier to derive the private key from the related public key, the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology could be impaired and our products and services could become less marketable. That could require us to make significant changes to our products and services, which could increase our costs, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Any of these events could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends substantially on our data center facilities and other systems and infrastructure provided by third parties, and their unreliability or unavailability for a significant period could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers of computer, cloud and telecommunications infrastructure to provide our products and services through the global internet and to provide network access between our data centers, our customers and end-users of our products and services. Much of the computer and communications hardware upon which our businesses depend is located in our data center facilities in North America and Europe. In addition to our data centers, as our business has grown, we have increased the use of co-located data centers managed by third parties to support our computer and communications hardware. If we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing co-located data center providers or establish new contractual relationships with co-located data center providers on favorable terms, or at all, we could be required to move our equipment to a new facility and may experience delays, increased costs or downtime for our customers. Our company-owned and co-located data centers might be damaged or interrupted as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including epidemics, fire, flood, natural disasters, power loss, mechanical failure, telecommunications failure, break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, hostilities or war or other events. Computer viruses, equipment failure, denial of service attacks, and similar disruptions affecting the internet, infrastructure supplied by third parties or our systems might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our services. Problems affecting our data center operations or the networks on which we rely, whether or not in our control, could result in loss of revenues, increased expenses, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation, liability and increased costs, and may cause our customers to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements. We do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any of these events. Though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures, the occurrence of any of these events, including multiple supplier outages or problems, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOutages or problems with internet communication systems and infrastructure supplied by third parties could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers of the telecommunications and internet infrastructure. We use various communications service suppliers and the global internet to provide network access between our data centers, our customers and end-users of our products and services. If those suppliers do not enable us to provide our customers with reliable, real-time access to our systems, we may be unable to gain or retain customers. These suppliers periodically experience outages or other operational problems as a result of internal system failures or external third-party actions. They might be damaged or interrupted as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our or their control, including fire, flood, power loss, mechanical failure, telecommunications failure, break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, hostilities or war or other events. Computer viruses, equipment failure, denial of service attacks, and similar disruptions affecting the internet, infrastructure supplied by third parties or our systems might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our services. Further, striving to protect email recipients from phishing and other exports, such suppliers email and web page security protection systems outside of our control may randomly and inadvertently delay or block important customer email streams or interfere with linkages between emails and web page access. Though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures, multiple supplier outages, problems providing reliable, real-time access or inadvertent delays or blocking of access could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe infrastructure supporting our business may suffer capacity constraints and business interruptions that could cause us to lose customers, increase our operating costs and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends on our providing our customers reliable, real-time access to our data centers and networks. Customers will not tolerate a service hampered by slow delivery times, unreliable service levels, service outages, or insufficient capacity. System capacity limits or constraints arising from unexpected increases in our volume of business or network traffic could cause interruptions, outages or delays in our services, or deterioration in their performance, or could impair our ability to process transactions. We may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our systems or to increase capacity to accommodate increased traffic on our systems in a timely fashion. System delays or interruptions may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers or other third parties, which could result in our losing customers and revenues, or incurring liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe growth of our business may require significant investment in systems and infrastructure and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected benefits, which could impair our profitability and negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nAs our operations grow in size and scope, we continually need to improve and upgrade our technology offerings, systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure and pursuing reduced costs per transaction. Expanding our technology offerings, systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that the volume of our business will increase, which could reduce our net income, deplete our cash, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results. Developing and launching new product offerings adjacent to or outside of our core service offerings can be particularly costly in terms of capital investments for both product development and marketing. At the same time, we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from these new offerings increasing the uncertainty concerning both market acceptance and our ability to successfully execute a sales and marketing strategy that justifies our investments. Our failure to properly manage and execute new product initiatives could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nDevelopment of our products depends on software service and maintenance and information systems provided by third parties, and their unreliability, system failures, interruptions or breaches of security could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe rely on third-party contractors, often located outside of the United States, to perform certain services and maintain our software and develop our products. If we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing third parties that facilitate our business or establish new contractual relationships with third parties that facilitate our business on favorable terms, or at all, it could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers. The third parties upon which we rely may fail to operate properly or experience operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints which might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from timely development of our products or from providing our services. Such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. Problems with respect to such third parties, whether or not in our control, could result in loss of revenues, increased expenses, inability to bill our customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation, liability and increased costs, and may cause our customers to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable customer agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nWe recognize revenue from some customers ratably over the terms of their customer agreements, which may be one year or two years. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from customer agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed client agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue or our results of operations until future periods. Accordingly, this revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nOur failure to keep pace with rapid technology changes could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent changes in customer requirements. We must continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services, particularly in response to competitive offerings, to keep pace with these developments. We must ensure that our products and services address evolving operating environments, devices, industry trends, certifications and standards. For example, we have been required to expand our offerings to support newer multi-tenant cloud architectures and accessibility standards. We also may need to develop products that are compatible with new operating systems while remaining compatible with existing, popular operating systems. Our business could be harmed by our competitors announcing or introducing new products and services that could be perceived by customers as superior to ours. We spend considerable resources on technology research and development, but our research and development resources are more limited than many of our competitors.\nIn addition, we are also focused on addressing new and accelerating market trends, such as the continued decline of on premise email security and advance threat protection solution(s) and the continued transition towards cloud-based solutions, which requires us to continue to improve our product and service offerings. We may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, to keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or to gain customer acceptance for our new and existing products and services, such as mobile device data protection, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nMobile devices are increasingly used to access the internet, and our cloud-based and mobile support products may not operate or be as effective when accessed through these devices, which could harm our business.\nHistorically, we designed our web-based products for use on a desktop or laptop computer; however, mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are increasingly being used as the primary means for accessing the internet and conducting e-commerce. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with third-party mobile devices and mobile operating systems, as well as web browsers we do not control. Any changes in such devices, systems or web browsers which degrade the functionality of our products or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect usage of our products. In the event our customers have difficulty accessing and using our products on mobile devices, our customer growth, business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services and synergies resulting from our recent acquisitions, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. To the extent these products or services remain subject to a service contract with the customer, we offer to transition the customer to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles and effectively convert to alternative products and services could result in us losing customers and revenues, or incurring contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe face strong competition, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change and converging technologies and are very competitive. With rising demand for private and secure email communications, there is strong competition for our products and services. Our Email Encryption Threat Protection, Archive, and Data Loss Prevention business competes with products and services offered by companies such as Barracuda Networks, Inc., Proofpoint, and Mimecast. Strong competition requires us to develop new technology solutions and service offerings to expand the functionality and value that we offer to our customers. Our competitors may develop products and services that are perceived by customers as equivalent to, or having advantages over, our products and services. We are also competing against other value-added cloud distributor platforms such as PAX8 and Sherweb, and our ability to maintain our managed service provider partners is dependent on our success in successfully competing with such competitors. Competitors could capture a significant share in our markets, causing our sales and revenue to decline or grow more slowly. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures are often formed that create products and platforms competitive with our products and platforms. Competitive pressures could lead to price discounting or to increases in expenses such as advertising and marketing costs. Increased competition could also decrease demand for our products and services. Competition could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may negatively affect our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward consolidation in our industry for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nSome competitors have advantages that may allow them to compete more effectively than us, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, more extensive operations, greater name recognition, larger technical staffs, bigger product development and acquisition budgets, established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors, and greater financial and marketing resources than we do. These advantages might enable them (independently or through alliances) to develop and expand functionality of products and services faster than we can, to spend more money to market and distribute products and services than we can, or to offer their products and services at prices lower than ours. These advantages could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe rely on marketing efforts of our sales force and channels to promote our brand and acquire new customers. If we do not effectively expand and train our sales force or lose access to these channels, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business may be negatively affected.\nWe rely on our sales force and a variety of channels, including online keyword search, television, email and social media marketing, to promote our brand, to obtain new customers and to sell additional solutions to our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require and our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. If we lose access to one of more of our marketing channels, either because the costs of advertising become prohibitively expensive or we change our marketing practices, or for other reasons, we may become unable to promote our brand effectively, limiting our ability to grow the business. Our marketing channels and our recent and planned hires may not become as productive or cost-effective as we expect in generating traffic to our website, attracting customers and renewing sales of our products. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or maintain access to sufficient channels, or the sales personnel and marketing channels are not successful in obtaining new clients or increasing sales to our existing client base, our business will be harmed.\nIf we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.\nWe have entered into several strategic alliances with other companies to offer complementary products and services. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects or series of projects, and their main goal is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. There can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas and these alliances can require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return. Also, if these partner companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. If we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing strategic partners or establish new contractual relationships with potential partners on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to offer the products and related functionality our customers expect, and we may experience delays and increased costs in adding customers and may lose customers. Any ineffectiveness of our strategic alliances could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe enlist third-party distributors to market our products and services, and our failure to succeed in those relationships could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe distribute a significant percentage of our products and services by entering into alliances with third parties who can offer our products and services along with their own or our competitors\u2019 products and services. Increased reliance on third parties to market and distribute our products and services exposes us to a variety of risks. For example, we have limited control over and visibility into the sales cycles of third-party distributors, which could increase the length of our sales cycle, cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably and make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenue. In addition, we may not succeed in developing or maintaining marketing alliances. Companies with which we have marketing alliances may in the future discontinue their relationships with us, form marketing alliances with our competitors, or develop and market their own products and services that compete with ours. If a significant distributor were to discontinue its relationship with us, we could experience an interruption in the distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline. Our failure to develop, maintain and expand strategic distribution relationships could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur relationship with Microsoft is non-exclusive and our failure to effectively manage and maintain this relationship or to successfully compete with other providers of Microsoft could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nBecause we provide our products to customers with Microsoft products, including Office 365, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is reliant on Microsoft products, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business. If we do not maintain our relationship with Microsoft as a reseller, or if they decide to stop utilizing resellers in distribution of their products, make an adverse change in their reseller program or change their product offerings, it could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nMicrosoft can change its product pricing and discounting to us at any time, and unless we are able to pass through such changes to our customers, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted. Further, Microsoft currently offers co-op and rebate programs in conjunction with our resale activities in which we earn money for certain purposes or achieving certain predefined objectives. If Microsoft changed the way that co-op or rebates are earned by eliminating or negatively modifying the programs, our gross profit and operating results distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline.\nOur relationship with Microsoft is non-exclusive and there are other resellers that also provide Microsoft products, including Office 365. Currently, we maintain a portion of the discount provided by Microsoft in the reseller program and pass along part of the discount to our distributors. Other resellers may be passing along to their third-party distributors the discount provided by Microsoft differently than us, which may increase competition for third-party distributors. Our failure to effectively compete with other Microsoft resellers could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur future growth and success may be affected by acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions, our operating results and prospects could be negatively affected.\nWe have acquired and expect to continue to acquire new products and technology, as well as customers, through acquisitions. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate on favorable terms, successfully complete and fully integrate such acquisitions. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock. Equity issuances in connection with potential future acquisitions may also result in dilution to our stockholders. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisition we complete may not be successful. Acquisitions we pursue, including our recent AppRiver acquisition and DeliverySlip asset acquisition, involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies and assets we acquire;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain or changes in relationships with the customers, the key employees, the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses and products we acquire and our current strategic partners;\n\u2022\nour inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset increased expenses generally associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in predicting or achieving synergies and cost savings between our existing businesses and acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including liabilities arising out of their failure to operate correctly, maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to acquisition, tax liabilities, litigation claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties and other known or unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with new markets or regulatory standards to which we were not previously subject;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or unanticipated expenses associated with development work that is necessary to achieve interoperability between our products and solutions and the products and solutions we acquire;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or unanticipated expenses associated with migrating customers from products and solutions developed by our acquisition targets to our own products and solutions;\n\u2022\ndelays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire increasing our vulnerability to network attacks security incidents, or similar events; and\n\u2022\nadverse effects of acquisition activity on the key performance indicators we use to monitor our performance as a business, including impacts resulting from performance earn-outs or contingent bonuses.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances occurring in future periods may affect the realizability of intangible assets that we are required to record on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. These events and circumstances could include significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business or product strategies. Such events and circumstances may cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our intangible assets, and any such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nUnfavorable economic environments, particularly in the U.S., could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nChallenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may contribute to future slowdowns in the technology and networking industries at large, as well as in the email/data security market and in specific geographic markets in which we operate. If economic growth in those markets, particularly in the U.S., which accounts for a substantial majority of our revenue, slows, or credit is unavailable at a reasonable cost, current and potential customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, including the deployment or expansion of our products and services and make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Additionally, as our business grows in international markets, we may become more susceptible to unfavorable economic environments outside the U.S. and that could compound the negative effects of unfavorable economic environments in markets in which we currently operate. This could result in reduced sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, adverse economic conditions and changes in trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers and distributors, which might result in failures or delays in payments to us. This could increase our credit risk exposure and delay our recognition of revenue. Specific economic trends, such as declines in the demand for cloud computing services and computing devices, or softness in corporate information technology spending, could have a more direct impact on our business. In addition, changing economic conditions may also adversely affect third parties with which we have entered into strategic relationships and upon which we depend in order to grow our business. As a result, we may be unable to continue to grow in the event of future economic slowdowns. If these conditions persist, spread or deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our products have defects or security vulnerabilities, our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected and we could experience negative publicity, declining sales and legal liability.\nThe threats facing our customers are constantly evolving and the techniques used by experienced hackers to access or sabotage data change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world. As a result, we must constantly update our product solutions to respond to these threats. We produce complex solutions that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software that must operate in a wide variety of technology environments. Software may contain defects or \u201cbugs\u201d that can interfere with expected operations or introduce security vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized use or data loss. Through our acquisitions, we have acquired some technology that we did not produce that may be particularly vulnerable to defects or \u201cbugs\u201d. There can be no assurance that our testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects prior to the product being introduced, which might decrease customer satisfaction with our products and services. The product reengineering cost to remedy a product defect or mitigate vulnerabilities could be material to our operating results. Our inability to cure a product defect could result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product or service from the market, a security breach, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, failure to achieve market acceptance, lost revenue and increased expense, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nIf our products do not work properly and customers do not receive high-quality customer service and support, our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected and we could experience negative publicity and declining sales.\nAfter implementing our product offerings, customers depend on our customer service and support team to quickly resolve any issues relating to those offerings. Further, as we continue to broaden our portfolio of solutions and increase the size of our customer base, we must continue to adapt our customer support organization to ensure our customers continue to receive the high level of customer service which they have come to expect. Notwithstanding our commitment to customer support, our customers will occasionally encounter defects or \u201cbugs\u201d that can interfere with expected operations or introduce security vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized use or data loss and other technical challenges and it is therefore critical we are there to provide ongoing, high-quality support to help our customers. If we do not provide effective ongoing customer service and support, our ability to sell our products to new and existing customers could be harmed, and our subscription renewal rates and cross-selling of our products may decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nIf our cloud platform does not interoperate with our customers\u2019 network and security infrastructure or with third-party products, websites or services, our cloud platform may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed.\nOur cloud platform must interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing network and security infrastructure. These complex systems are developed, delivered and maintained by the customer and a myriad of vendors and service providers. As a result, the components of our customers\u2019 infrastructure have different specifications, rapidly evolve, utilize multiple protocol standards, include multiple versions and generations of products and may be highly customized. We must be able to interoperate and provide our security services to customers with highly complex and customized networks, which requires careful planning and execution between our customers, our customer support teams and our channel partners. Further, when new or updated elements of our customers\u2019 infrastructure or new industry standards or protocols, such as IPv6 are introduced, we may have to update or enhance our cloud platform to allow us to continue to provide service to customers. Our competitors or other vendors may refuse to work with us to allow their products to interoperate with our solutions, which could make it difficult for our cloud platform to function properly in customer networks that include these third-party products.\nWe also seek to integrate our customers\u2019 existing network and infrastructure to establish interoperability with our Information Archive product. The integration requires coordination with other venders that could refuse to work with us or make it difficult to complete these integrations, potentially impacting our sales and revenue.\nWe may not deliver or maintain interoperability quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. These efforts require capital investment and engineering resources. If we fail to maintain compatibility of our cloud platform and products with our customers\u2019 network and security infrastructures, our customers may not be able to fully utilize our solutions, and we may, among other consequences, lose or fail to increase our market share and experience reduced demand for our services, which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur transmission and storage of personally identifiable information, including the personal data of European data subjects and other confidential information, and the potential for inadvertent exposure of PII or CI, could cause us to violate data privacy laws or lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe transmit and store large amounts of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about individuals, which may include healthcare or financial information, and other confidential information (\u201cCI\u201d). Data privacy and protection is highly regulated in many jurisdictions and may become the subject of additional regulation in the future. For example, lawmakers and regulators worldwide are considering proposals that would require companies, like us that encrypt users\u2019 data to ensure access to such data by law enforcement authorities. Although we have established, and continue to develop and enhance, security measures and controls to help protect against unauthorized disclosure of such PII and other CI and comply with applicable laws, an inadvertent disclosure of, or unauthorized third-party access to, PII or CI, or failure to comply with applicable laws could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and subject us to claims, fines or other liabilities.\nIn addition, our processing and storage of certain types of data is subject to confidentiality agreements with our clients and handling PII is increasingly subject to a variety of changing privacy and data security regulations around the world. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Protection Act, or the CCPA, that will, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information; the CCPA will go into full effect on July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions and is the subject of proposed regulations of the California Attorney General released on October 10, 2019. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our users\u2019 data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to modify our products, possibly in a material manner, stop offering certain products and could limit our ability to develop and implement new product features.\nIn addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union and Canada, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from their residents which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. For example, the collection and use of personal data in the European Union is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. GDPR imposes several requirements relating to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data, such as requirements for using consent or other legal grounds to process personal data, providing information to individuals about how their personal data is used, maintaining adequate security and data protection measures, giving data breach notifications, complying with individuals\u2019 requests to access, correct or delete their personal data and using third-party processors of personal data. GDPR also maintains the European Union\u2019s strict rules limiting the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. GDPR imposes substantial potential fines for violations and increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process. We are an Active Participant in the Privacy Shield program. Although our personal data practices, policies, and procedures are intended to comply with GDPR, there can be no assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view these arrangements as being in compliance with applicable laws, or that one or more of our employees or agents will not disregard the rules we have established which allows us to transfer personal data of European data subjects that we receive from customers to the United States, in compliance with the Privacy Shield principles. Such laws and regulations, Privacy Shield certification and other mechanisms are subject to pending legal challenges which may result in new and differing interpretations and different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data among jurisdictions. Further, following a referendum in June 2016 in which United Kingdom voters approved an exit from the European Union, the United Kingdom officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020, with a transitional period set to end on December 31, 2020 (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), which has created uncertainty with regard to the requirements for data transfers between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other jurisdictions.\nAny new laws, regulations, or other legal obligations or industry standards, or future changes in requirements or interpretations under these regulations may be inconsistent with our existing data management practices. If so, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business, including increased cost of compliance, negative publicity to us and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers.\nAny inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional costs and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and harm our business. Furthermore, any inadvertent disclosure of, or unauthorized access (including due to a cyber-attack) to, PII or other CI or other failure by us to comply with data privacy requirements could subject us to significant penalties, damages, remediation and other expenses, and damage our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nProblems with protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights to establish and protect intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in our products and services. These intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights might be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We attempt to protect our intellectual property under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and through a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other methods, all of which may not prevent the misuse, theft or misappropriation of our proprietary information. We may choose not to seek patent or trademark protection for certain innovations or not to pursue patent or trademark protection in certain jurisdictions, and may choose to abandon patents and trademarks that are no longer of strategic value to us. The process of obtaining patent and trademark protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent and trademark applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology into their products. Competitors may hire our former employees who may misappropriate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in some jurisdictions which may not provide adequate legal protection of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. As we continue to grow our international business, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase.\nWe may have to defend or assert our rights in intellectual property that we use in our products and services, and we could be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could be disruptive and expensive to our business.\nWe may have to defend against claims that we or our customers are infringing the rights of third parties in patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. If we acquire technology to include in our products and services from third parties, our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology. Also, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, including initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or misappropriation. Intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive, whether or not resolved in our favor and may be particularly difficult, expensive and time-consuming in some jurisdictions which do not afford as strong of legal protections of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. Even unmeritorious claims brought against us or our customers may harm our reputation and customer relationships, may cause us to incur significant legal and other fees to defend, and may have to be settled for significant amounts. Infringement claims against us could require us to develop non-infringing products and services or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements. Our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to develop non-infringing technology or license technology on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe may face risks from using \u201copen source\u201d software that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nLike many other software companies, we use \u201copen source\u201d software in order to take advantage of common industry building blocks and to add functionality to our products quickly and inexpensively. Open source software license terms could adversely affect our intellectual property rights in our products that include open source software. Depending upon how the open source software is deployed, we could be required to offer products that use the open source software for no cost, or make available the source code for modifications or derivative works. Any of these obligations could have an adverse impact on our intellectual property rights and revenue from products incorporating the open source software. Using open source code could also cause us to inadvertently infringe third-party intellectual property rights or require us to publicly disclose proprietary information. We have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns, but we cannot be sure that our process or controls will be sufficient to mitigate all risk in this regard. Open source software might also introduce security vulnerabilities or defective functionality. The open source community may not always respond with adequate urgency to mitigate the impacts of such defects.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party intellectual property, which may not be accessible to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nSome of our products include third-party intellectual property, which may require licenses for our use. For example, a significant portion of the revenue generated by our Erado business is dependent on the licensing of certain electronic message API\u2019s, such as those made available by LinkedIn Corporation, SMS providers, Facebook, and other social media channels, and a significant portion of the revenue generated by our AppRiver business is dependent on the licensing of Microsoft products such as Office 365. We also rely on the licensing of certain third-party APIs with respect to our billing systems for customers. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses for new or current products on acceptable terms or at all. Changes in the terms of such licenses may decrease our product margins and our failure to obtain or maintain such licenses may limit our ability to sell our products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation, law enforcement investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation involving our business, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although we vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our products and services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, creativity, diversity, a customer-centric focus, collaboration and loyalty. Our corporate culture is central to our devoted customer support and service team which is a key component of the value we offer our customers. As we continue to evolve our business, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Difficulty in preserving our corporate culture could be exacerbated as we continue to expand internationally, grow our employee base and expand our solutions. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\nWe may fail to recruit, retain and motivate key personnel, which could impair our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense and there is high demand for employees who have highly technical skills and experience, increasing difficulty in recruiting, hiring and retaining such key employees. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain key personnel, our employees generally work for us on an \u201cat-will\u201d basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time and, as highly skilled and experienced personnel, would be difficult to replace. Changes in key personnel may be disruptive to our business. It could be difficult, time consuming and expensive to replace key personnel. Integrating new key personnel may be difficult and costly. Volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives. Any of these impairments related to our key personnel could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nGovernmental restrictions on the sale of our products and services in non-U.S. markets could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nExports of software solutions and services using encryption technology such as ours are generally restricted by the U.S. government. Although we have obtained U.S. government approval to export our service to almost all countries, the list of countries to which we (and our distributors) cannot export our products and services could be expanded in the future. In addition, some countries impose restrictions on the importation and use of encryption solutions and services such as ours. The cost of compliance with U.S. and other export laws, or our failure to obtain governmental approvals to offer our products and services in non-U.S. markets, could affect our ability to sell our products and services and could impair our international expansion. We face a variety of other legal and compliance risks. If we or our distributors fail to comply with applicable law and regulations, we may become subject to penalties, fines or restrictions that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nAs a result of our international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nOur sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nSales to U.S. federal, state and local governmental agency customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in past periods, and we may in the future increase sales to government agencies. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government contractual requirements often carry a high compliance risk. Government certification requirements for solutions like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities also may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness, Capital Structure and Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our business or respond to changes, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto under which we established (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $175 million, (ii) a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $10 million and (iii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25 million (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Zix. The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all assets of Zix and the guarantors, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Credit Facilities will mature in February of 2024. The incurrence of this indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, stock buybacks and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during periods of adverse economic, financial market or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlengthening or otherwise adversely affecting our sales process as customers evaluate our financial viability.\nOptional prepayments of borrowings under the Credit Facilities will be permitted at any time, without premium (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs). We must prepay the term loan facility in equal quarterly installments of $437,500 on the last day of each March, June, September and December until maturity in February of 2024. In addition to other customary mandatory prepayment requirements, the term loan facility requires annual prepayments based on a percentage of Zix\u2019s excess cash flow, which percentage will reduce as Zix\u2019s total net leverage ratio decreases. We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. To a significant extent, our ability to do so is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, financial condition and ability to expand our business may be adversely affected.\nThe interest rate on our Credit Facilities will float over time and is initially LIBOR plus 3.50%, with future step downs in the interest rate margin as our total net leverage reduces. The floating rate nature of this interest rate exposes us to interest rate risk. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense even though the amount borrowed remains the same.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit agreement may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nThe credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. The financial covenant requires Zix to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) and is tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The non-financial covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, merge with or acquire other entities, make investments, dispose of assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make dividends, distributions or stock repurchases, prepay junior indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements, and amend our organizational documents or the terms of junior indebtedness.\nThese restrictions may make it more difficult or discourage a takeover of Zix, whether favored or opposed by our management and/or our Board of Directors.\nOur ability to comply with some of these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to do so. Failure to comply could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing, or to reduce expenditures. We cannot guarantee that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nUpon the occurrence of a default, or if we are unable to make the representations and warranties in the credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities, we will not be able to borrow funds or issue letters of credit under our Credit Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay that amount, our lenders could seize our assets securing the loans and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) and investment agreement restrict our ability to incur certain indebtedness which limits our flexibility in operating our business.\nIn February 2019, we issued Series A Preferred Stock established by a Certificate of Designations (the \u201cSeries A Certificate of Designations\u201d) and Series B Preferred Stock established by a Certificate of Designations (the \u201cSeries B Certificate of Designations\u201d), which contain covenants that, among other things, require the consent of the holders of a majority of each of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock before we can incur indebtedness in excess of a specified leverage ratio.\nIn January 2019, we entered into an investment agreement with an investment fund managed by True Wind Capital (the \u201cInvestor\u201d), which contains customary covenants, including among others, that for so long as any shares of preferred stock issued pursuant to the investment agreement are outstanding, the consent of the Investor will be necessary for us to issue, subject to certain exceptions, any debt securities convertible into any of our capital stock.\nAt our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in June 2019, our shareholders voted to approve, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635, (i) the conversion of our then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future conversion or redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock into common stock, or any other issuance of common stock to the Investor pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement that, absent such approval, would violate Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (the \u201cNasdaq Proposal\u201d). Following shareholder approval of the Nasdaq Proposal, the 35,086 then-outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock converted into 35,292 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and we paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock cash in lieu of any fractional shares. We currently do not have any shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all, and such additional financing may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility or cause dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe may require additional financing in the future to operate or expand our business, acquire assets or repay or refinance our existing debt. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our business development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, as well as other factors beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Additionally, under the terms of our credit agreement, preferred stock and investment agreement, respectively, we are restricted from incurring additional debt, subject to certain exceptions. Any additional funding we obtain may include similar restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock or preferred stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our solutions;\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;\n\u2022\nrepay or refinance our existing debt;\n\u2022\nacquire complementary technologies, solutions or businesses;\n\u2022\nexpand operations, in the United States or internationally;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressure or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could seriously impact our business, negatively affecting financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be able to incur more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness.\nDespite our current indebtedness level, we may be able to incur more indebtedness in the future. We are not completely prohibited under the terms of the credit agreement, preferred stock, investment agreement or other agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions, any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness. If new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries' current debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur preferred stockholders can exercise significant control over the Company, which could limit the ability of our common stockholders to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nThe Investor holds approximately 24 % of our outstanding voting capital stock based on the number of shares of common stock and convertible Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of March 4, 2020, on an as-converted basis. The Investor\u2019s aggregate voting power will increase further in connection with future accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock for as long as the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote their shares, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock. As a result, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. The Investor is entitled to act separately in its own respective interests with respect to its ownership interests in the Company and has the ability to substantially influence the election of the members of our Board of Directors, thereby potentially controlling our management and affairs. In addition, the Investor has significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions.\nAdditionally, holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are required to approve certain matters as a class, voting separately from the common stock, such as (1) any amendment, alteration or repeal to our Restated Articles of Incorporation (the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) or the Series A Certificate of Designations in a manner that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or power of the Series A Preferred Stock; (2) any amendment or alteration to our Articles of Incorporation or any other action to authorize or create, or increase the number of authorized or issued shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, or reclassify any security into, or issue any parity stock or senior stock as to dividend or liquidation rights; (3) the issuance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (4) any action that would cause us to cease to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (5) the incurrence of indebtedness that would cause us to exceed a specified leverage ratio.\nFurther, holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, are required to approve certain matters as a class, voting separately from the common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock, such as (1) any amendment, alteration or repeal to our Articles of Incorporation or the Series B Certificate of Designations in a manner that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or power of the Series B Preferred Stock; (2) any amendment or alteration to our Articles of Incorporation or any other action to authorize or create, or increase the number of authorized or issued shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, or reclassify any security into, or issue any parity stock or senior stock as to dividend or liquidation rights; (3) the issuance of any additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock; (4) any action that would cause us to cease to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (5) the incurrence of indebtedness that would cause us to exceed a specified leverage ratio.\nAny issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock will cause dilution to existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has an initial stated value of $1,000 per share, which stated value will accrete at an annual rate of 8% per annum, compounded quarterly. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holders, into (i) the number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (A) the stated value per share as it has accreted as of such date multiplied by (B) the Conversion Rate as of the applicable conversion date divided by (C) 1,000 plus (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Conversion Rate is equal to 166.11 shares of our common stock and is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain customary events in accordance with the terms of the Series A Certificate of Designations. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to participate in dividends paid in respect of the common stock on an as-converted basis.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of our common stock holders, and such dilution will increase over time in connection with the future accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of companies. We may in the future become subject to such shareholder activism and demands. Such demands may disrupt our business and divert the attention of management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could negatively impact our business. Shareholder activism could result in substantial costs. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals of our business.\nTexas law and our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe Texas Business Organizations Code, as amended (\u201cTBOC\u201d), and our Articles of Incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our Board of Directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions regarding:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer, and pursuant to which we have issued the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, each of which are entitled to receive a liquidation preference and certain amounts in connection with a change of control of the company and other similar extraordinary transactions;\n\u2022\nthe limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that directors may only be removed from our Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose at which quorum is present;\n\u2022\na prohibition on common stockholder action by written consent, which forces common stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take other action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors or a holder of at least 10% of all of the shares of the Company entitled to vote at the proposed special meeting, and must be called by our president or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the members of our Board of Directors, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nprovisions enabling us to control the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board of Directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of all issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors at a properly called and convened annual or special meeting of shareholders, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of our Articles of Incorporation or our bylaws, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our Board of Directors and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws, which may allow our Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our Board of Directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our Board of Directors or management.\nIn addition, as a Texas corporation, we are subject to provisions of Texas law, including Section 21.606 of the TBOC, which may prohibit certain stockholders holding 20% or more of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a specified period of time.\nAny provision of Texas law or our Articles of Incorporation or bylaws that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOther Risks Related to our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock\nFuture resales of our common stock held by our significant stockholders or of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversation of the Series A Preferred Stock may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nWe are obligated to register the resale of the common stock issuable upon conversion of, or issued as dividends upon, the Series A Preferred Stock, and to take certain actions to facilitate the transfer and sale of such shares. Upon such registration, shares of common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock are converted would be freely tradable. The common stock issuable upon conversion may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens, the price of the company\u2019s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market, or the perception that such sales might occur, will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb converted shares sold by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nAny sale of large amounts of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the price of our common stock or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets generally available for distribution to our equity holders, together with holders of our Series B Preferred Stock and before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock (including our common stock), in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 plus all accreted but unpaid dividends and (ii) the amount such holder would have been entitled to receive if the Series A Preferred Stock had converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets generally available for distribution to our equity holders, together with holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock (including our common stock), in an amount equal to $1,000 plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.\nIn addition, the $1,000 stated value per share of our Series A Preferred Stock will accrete at a fixed rate of 8.0% per annum, compounded quarterly. The holders Series A Preferred Stock are also entitled to receive any dividends paid in respect of our common stock on an as-converted basis. The holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends accruing daily on a cumulative basis payable quarterly in arrears in cash at a fixed rate of 10.0% per annum on the $1,000 stated value per share (the \u201cDividend Rate\u201d), which rate will automatically increase by 1.0% every six months that the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding and unconverted (subject to a cap of 12.0%). If cash dividends are not paid in respect of any dividend payment period, the liquidation preference of each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically increase at the Dividend Rate.\nFurther, the Series A Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable upon a change of control (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designations), at a price per share of Series A Preferred Stock in cash equal to the greater of (i) the Series A Change of Control Redemption Price (as defined below) and (ii) (A) the amount of cash such holder of Series A Preferred Stock would have received plus (B) the fair market value of any other assets such holder would have received, in each case had such holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, immediately prior to such change of control, converted such shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock. The \u201cSeries A Change of Control Redemption Price\u201d per share of Series A Preferred Stock is the product of the accreted value of such share as of the date of determination multiplied by (1) 1.30 (if the change of control occurs before the first anniversary of the date of issuance); (2) 1.35 (if the change of control occurs on or after the first anniversary of the date of issuance but before the second anniversary of the date of issuance); (3) 1.40 (if the change of control occurs on or after the second anniversary of the date of issuance but before the third anniversary of the date of issuance); (4) 1.45 (if the change of control occurs on or after the third anniversary of the date of issuance but before the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance); and (5) 1.50 (if the change of control occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance).\nFurther, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock also have redemption rights upon the occurrence of certain events. Specifically, the Series B Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable, upon the holder\u2019s election and after 90 days prior notice, any time after the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance at an amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the liquidation preference per share of the Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed as of the applicable redemption date multiplied by 1.50. The Series B Preferred Stock is also mandatorily redeemable upon a change of control (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designations), at a price per share of Series B Preferred Stock in cash equal to the greater of (i) the Series B Change of Control Redemption Price (as defined below) and (ii) (A) the amount of cash such holder of Series B Preferred Stock would have received plus (B) the fair market value of any other assets in each case had such holder of Series B Preferred Stock, immediately prior to such change of control, converted such shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The \u201cSeries B Change of Control Redemption Price\u201d per share of Series B Preferred Stock is the product of the liquidation preference of such share as of the date of determination multiplied by (1) 1.30 (if the change of control occurs before the first anniversary of the date of issuance); (2) 1.35 (if the change of control occurs on or after the first anniversary of the date of issuance but before the second anniversary of the date of issuance); (3) 1.40 (if the change of control occurs on or after the second anniversary of the date of issuance but before the third anniversary of the date of issuance); (4) 1.45 (if the change of control occurs on or after the third anniversary of the date of issuance but before the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance); and (5) 1.50 (if the change of control occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance).\nFinally, any time after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we have the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for cash at a redemption price equal to the accreted value per share of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed multiplied by 1.50. Likewise, at any time after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, we have the right to redeem the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share of the Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed multiplied by 1.50.\nThese dividend and redemption payment obligations could significantly impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of our cash flows that are available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights described above could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75853, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ZIXI"}
