{"cik": "1524472", "company": "Xylem Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business and investment in our securities, investors should carefully consider the following discussion of material factors and events, along with all of the other information in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC. The events and consequences discussed below could, in circumstances that we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations or market price of our common stock.\nThese risk factors do not identify all of the risks we face. Our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies. In addition, we operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment and as a result new risk factors may emerge from time to time. Risks not currently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may impact our business operations, financial condition or share price. The global economic and geopolitical climate, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, amplifies many of the risks below.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry Factors\nIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect our markets and our customers\u2019 operating conditions, which can in turn affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith sales in over 150 countries, we compete in a wide range of geographic and product markets. Material economic and industry factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of, and our customers\u2019 confidence in, local and global macroeconomic conditions; industrial and private sector spending; federal, state, local and municipal governmental fiscal, trade and procurement policies; strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets; the availability of commercial financing for our customers and end-users; and the degree of funding for our public sector customers, including with respect to water infrastructure investments. The downturn in the global economy due to the impacts of COVID-19 has, and continues to have, a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Future slowdowns or prolonged downturns in the global economy or our markets could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to geopolitical, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange and other risks associated with our global sales and operations.\nIn 2020, 47% of our total revenue was from customers within the U.S. and 53% was from customers outside the U.S. We expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue. Many of our manufacturing operations, employees and suppliers are located outside of the U.S. Our operations and sales both within the U.S. and internationally are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent in doing business globally, including:\n\u2022changes in trade protection measures, including embargoes, tariffs and other trade barriers, and import and export regulations and licensing requirements;\n\u2022instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including economic nationalism, populism, protectionism and anti-global sentiment;\n\u2022changes in tax laws and potential negative consequences from the interpretation, application and enforcement by governmental tax authorities of tax laws and policies;\n\u2022unanticipated changes in other laws and regulations or how such provisions are interpreted or administered;\n\u2022disruptions in our global supply chain;\n\u2022unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, including those related to infrastructure and data transmission, security and privacy;\n\u2022shocks to the global financial system, including due to global health crises, the effects of climate change, or due to idiosyncratic events, such as a terrorist attack;\n\u2022theft, compromise or misappropriation of technology or intellectual property;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or payment of distributions, dividends, loans or advances to us by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022disruption of operations from labor or political disturbances;\n\u2022regional safety and security considerations;\n\u2022the transition away from benchmark reference rates based on market participant judgments, such as LIBOR and EURIBOR, to rates based on observable transactions, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate;\n\u2022increased costs and risks in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance, remote work arrangements, language and cultural differences; and\n\u2022threat, outbreak, uncertainty or escalation of political instability, insurrection, armed conflict, terrorism, global health crises or pandemics, or war.\nAdditionally, we continue to monitor the impacts of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) on our supply chain, operations and financial results. The U.K. and the EU concluded a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d) that has been provisionally applied since January 1, 2021, pending ratification by the EU Parliament. The TCA creates a number of risks and uncertainties for our businesses. It provides for duties on goods traded between the U.K. and EU, including a preferential treatment provision for no duties on goods that meet certain origin criteria. Our businesses may not be able to benefit from the preferential treatment provision given the origin of certain components used in the manufacture of our products and related certification requirements. The TCA does not specify rules for trade in services, and as such our services are subject to the World Trade Organization\u2019s rules until the parties to the TCA resolve this trade issue. There is also uncertainty as to whether the EU Parliament will ratify the TCA, amend or reject it in its entirety. In addition, the new trading relationship between the U.K. and EU has increased, and will continue to increase, our costs, including for transportation and duties on products not otherwise eligible for preferential treatment under the TCA. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, shipping delays given the need for customs inspections and other procedures at the border, including with respect to requirements to mitigate the risks of COVID-19. Volatility in foreign currencies and other markets may also arise as the U.K. and EU work through the TCA or other new trade arrangements. Additionally, once the TCA is formalized, there could be other near-or long-term negative impacts. The U.K. will also need to negotiate its own trade treaties with countries around the world, which could take years to complete, and any disagreements on trade terms could result in supply chain delays or other disruptions. As a result, we face continued uncertainty and risks of disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, 19% of our total revenues were generated in emerging markets and we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets. Beyond the general risks that we face outside the U.S., our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties, including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business. In addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including the difficulty of enforcing agreements, challenges collecting receivables, protecting our intellectual property and other assets, pressure on the pricing of our products and services, higher business conduct risks, and the ability to hire and retain qualified talent. We cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our employees, customers, supply chain, operations and sales. The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has, and continues to, curtail the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in many of the regions where we sell our products and services and conduct operations. Government-mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, quarantines, stay at home or similar measures in many of the areas in which we operate, resulted in temporary production impacts at several of our facilities in 2020, curtailed, and continues to curtail, the business and operations of some of our customers and suppliers, and also impacted, and continues to impact, our ability to access our customers\u2019 sites. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues or worsens, including mutations of the virus, we may experience a continued decline in sales and customer orders in certain of our businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic also has, and continues to, impact our supply chain with unpredictable disruptions, capacity constraints or delays in shipment of materials necessary to the manufacture of our products. While we have taken reasonable measures to mitigate these impacts, as the pandemic continues, or if it worsens, our manufacturing facilities and supply chain may continue to be significantly impacted. Accordingly, the pandemic has negatively impacted our revenue growth in certain of our businesses. It is uncertain how materially the COVID-19 pandemic, including any mutations of the virus, the corresponding rollout, efficacy or unanticipated consequences of such vaccines, and the pace of recovery will affect our global operations and sales if these impacts persist, worsen or re-emerge throughout 2021 and beyond. The extent and duration of these impacts on us are dependent in part on demand for our products and services, customers\u2019 budgets, spending, willingness to allow\nus access to their job sites and continuation of planned projects, continued funding for infrastructure investments, particularly water infrastructure, our suppliers\u2019 ability to continue to supply us with parts, components and raw materials, and logistics providers' ability to continue shipment of our products and supplies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in the financial and capital markets. A further disruption of global financial markets or resulting economic downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic or other global health crises may reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital, or increase our cost of capital. There are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. Additionally, concerns over the economic impacts of COVID-19 have caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in our stock price. A sustained downturn may impact our liquidity position, including our ability to continue to pay dividends, or may impact our asset values resulting in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which may require us to recognize an impairment to those assets. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote working arrangements for employees, has not to date but could in the future impact our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the associated economic downturn, impacts on our markets and other impacts to our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that COVID-19 conditions improve, the duration and sustainability of such improvements will be uncertain, and continuing adverse impacts or the degree of improvement may vary by business and/or geography. Actions we may take in response to improvements in conditions may also vary by business and/or geography, and may be made with incomplete information. There is a risk that such actions could be premature, insufficient or incorrect and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nInflation, tariffs, customs duties and other increases in manufacturing and operating costs could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur operating costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in prices for commodities, parts, raw materials, energy and related utilities, freight, and cost of labor which may be driven by inflation, prevailing price levels, exchange rates, changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs, and other economic factors. Our operating costs have in the past and may continue to be impacted by price inflation, including in 2021 with respect to the cost of certain commodities, freight and logistics. The U.S. has enacted various trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods we import from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the U.S., or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries, could increase the cost of our products that we may not be able to offset. The TCA between the U.K. and EU, which has been provisionally applied since January 1, 2021 pending ratification by the EU Parliament, imposes duties on goods traded between the U.K. and EU. In order to remain competitive, we may not be able to recover all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases. Further, in a declining price environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first-out method. Actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and, as a result, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations.\nSales outside of the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2020 accounted for approximately 53% of our net sales. We also have significant operations in various locations outside of the U.S. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swedish Krona, Polish Zloty, Canadian Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar. Changes in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. Dollar or Euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar. The translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, Chinese Yuan, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Swedish Krona. As the U.S. Dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business, revenue and income can be impacted. Strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business, could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods. Refer to Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" for additional information on foreign exchange risk.\nOur pension and other defined benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nCertain current and retired employees are covered by pension and other defined benefit plans (collectively, \u201cpost-retirement benefit plans\u201d). We make contributions to fund our post-retirement benefit plans when we consider it necessary or advantageous to do so. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in fair value of or investment losses on plan assets, changes in discount rates, or changes in minimum funding requirements established by governments, taxing authorities or other agreement, could increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial condition and cash flows in future periods. In addition, the cost of our post-retirement benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors that can be volatile and unpredictable, including rates of return on plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, change in laws and regulatory actions, rates of future compensation increases, and changes in actuarial experience and assumptions, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nFailure to compete successfully in our markets, including our ability to develop innovative and disruptive technologies, could adversely affect our business.\nWe offer our technologies, products and services in highly competitive markets. We believe the principal points of competition are product and service performance, quality and reliability, innovation, speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product security, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of our service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels, price and customers\u2019 experience in doing business with us. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors in a business environment with increasingly rapid rates of change and disruption.\nOur competitive position and future growth rate depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully: (i) innovate, develop and maintain competitive products, services, business models and customer experience to address emerging trends and meet customers\u2019 needs, (ii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, many of which are new and non-traditional competitors from outside our industry, such as large technology firms, or those out of emerging markets, (iii) enhance our product and service offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively, (v) continue to cultivate, develop and maintain our distribution network of channel partners, (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite innovation and technical expertise and understanding of customers\u2019 needs to develop new technologies, products and services, (vii) continue to invest in manufacturing, research and development, engineering, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks, (viii) win large contracts, and (ix) compete for business subject to applicable governmental procurement laws and policies, including the Buy America and Buy American Act requirements in the U.S., as they may evolve over time.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The failure of our technologies, products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings, or customers\u2019 slower-than-expected adoption of and investment in our new and innovative technologies could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive position. Pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive, or we may not be able to continue to win large contracts, which could adversely affect our market share and competitive position.\nCybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure, communications networks and operations could adversely affect our business, products and services.\nOur business operations rely on information technology and communications networks, some of which are operated by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, to process, transmit and store our electronic information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees, customers or other business partners. We have, or operate through, a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared service centers. With the COVID-19 pandemic impacting our business since March 2020, a significant portion of our workforce transitioned to remote working, which we expect to be the case for the foreseeable future, and they are reliant on our information technology infrastructure and communication networks to perform their jobs, as well as access to reliable and safe communication networks in their communities. We also rely on third parties\u2019 information technology systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and\nactivities, including with regard to remote work. Regardless of protection measures, essentially all systems are susceptible to damage, disruption or shut-down due to cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware, denial-of-service, computer viruses and security breaches; equipment or system failure, including due to maintenance, obsolescence or age; and other events or circumstances, such as human error or malfeasance, vandalism, natural disaster, fire, power, communication or other utility outage, shutdown or utility failure and other events. In any such circumstances, our system redundancy and other business continuity and disaster recovery planning and response may be ineffective or inadequate.\nIn addition, we offer certain services and products, including pumps, controllers and meters that may be digitally-enabled or connect to and are part of the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT), and are used by third parties for operational purposes or to collect data. Cybersecurity attacks may target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted by our products after they have been purchased and incorporated into third parties\u2019 products, facilities or infrastructure. While we attempt to provide security measures to safeguard our products and services from cyber threats, the potential for an attack remains. A successful attack may result in the misappropriation, destruction, unauthorized access to or disclosure of third parties' confidential information, damage or disruption to third parties\u2019 operations, recall of our products or increased costs for security and remediation, as well as damage to our brand reputation.\nLike many multinational companies, we, and some third parties upon which we rely, have experienced cybersecurity attacks on information technology networks and systems, products and services in the past and may experience them in the future, likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business, operations, products, services or customers. We have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with cybersecurity threats, breaches or other disruptions or damage to our information technology networks and systems, products and services but the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and threats could impact our business, operations, products and services. Disruption to information technology and communications networks on which we rely, or an attack on our products and services, could interfere with our operations, disrupt our supply chain and service to our customers, interrupt production and shipments, result in theft or compromise of our and our customers\u2019 intellectual property and trade secrets, damage employee, customer and business partner relationships, negatively impact our reputation, result in legal claims and proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, and increase our costs for security and remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAlthough we continue to assess these risks, implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning, we cannot be sure that cybersecurity attacks or other interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur.\nA material disruption to any of our facilities or operations, or that of third parties upon which we rely, may adversely affect our business.\nOur facilities and operations rely on a complex global supply chain including suppliers (and their suppliers), distributors, contract manufacturers and logistics providers. In addition, our business relies on certain third parties to supply critical business processes and activities, including in the areas of Finance, Human Resources, Procurement and Information Technology. We also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared services centers. If our facilities or the operations of third parties upon which we rely were to be disrupted as a result of an actual or threatened event or circumstance, including a significant equipment or system failure, natural disaster, effects of climate change, power, water or communications outage, fire, explosion, critical supply failure, terrorism, cybersecurity attack, political disruption, outbreak of a pandemic or other public health crisis, insurrection, armed conflict or war, labor dispute, work stoppage or slowdown, technology failure, adverse weather conditions or other reason, it could cause material adverse impacts to our financial performance, operations and business, including an inability to meet customer demand or contractual commitments, increased costs, reduced sales, and impact our business processes and activities, including our ability to timely report financial results. Any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects, require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect our operations, business processes and activities, profitability and financial condition. Any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption or any resultant longer-term loss of suppliers, sales or customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Although we continue to assess these risks, implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning, we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects on our operational and financial performance will not occur.\nLack of availability of products, parts and raw materials from our supply chain or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business relies on suppliers (and their suppliers), including contract manufacturing, commodity markets and logistics providers, to secure and ship select finished goods and raw materials, parts and components that are used in our products. We expect that our reliance on, and the complexity of, the supply chain will continue to increase. Parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors, fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, batteries, PCBs and electronic components, as well as commodities, including steel, brass, nickel, copper, aluminum and plastics. We are exposed to the availability of these parts, components, materials and finished goods, which have in the past and may in the future be subject to delay, curtailment or change due to, among other things, changes in the strategy or production planning of suppliers including decisions to exit production of key components upon which we rely, interruptions in production by suppliers, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers\u2019 capacity allocations to other purchasers, changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs, exchange rates and prevailing price levels, ability to meet regulatory requirements, weather emergencies and associated effects of climate change, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, or acts of war or terrorism. In particular, we have in the past and continue to experience capacity constraints and delays with respect to supply of electronic components. Any suspension or delay in our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to timely deliver products to our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our products and offerings in our Measurement & Control Solutions segment are affected by the availability, regulation of and interference with radio spectrum that we use.\nA significant portion of the offerings in our Measurement & Control Solutions segment use radio spectrum, which is subject to government regulation. To the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the U.S. or another country, such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications. In some countries, limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries. The regulations that govern our use of radio spectrum may change, which may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships, either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations. The inability to modify our products to meet such requirements, the possible delays in completing or the cost of such modifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to secure suitable partners for co-development of products.\nIn the U.S., our products are primarily designed to use FCC-licensed spectrum in the 900MHz range. If the FCC does not renew our existing spectrum licenses, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all.\nOutside the U.S., certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations. In some jurisdictions, radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed. Our advanced and smart metering systems offerings transmit to (and receive information from, if applicable) handheld, mobile, or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers. We may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations, or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all.\nFailure to retain our existing senior management, engineering, technology, sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified and diverse talent could negatively impact our business.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain and attract employees in senior management positions, and in strategic or core competencies, including engineering, innovation, digital technologies, sales excellence, and project management. Our success in attracting and retaining employees will depend on our ability to offer attractive compensation, benefits, training and development opportunities in an increasingly competitive environment for talent, particularly in the fields of digital technologies, innovation and data science. In addition, advancing our culture of diversity and inclusion is an important factor for executing on our strategy, driving innovation, remaining competitive and creating long-term value. We also need to continue to develop qualified talent to support business growth and robust succession plans, which are important to our long-term success. A failure to attract or retain highly engaged and skilled personnel could adversely affect our ability to meet and exceed the needs of our customers, operate or grow our business and execute our strategy.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and realignment plans or our restructuring and realignment may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2020, in response to the business and economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in recent fiscal years, we have initiated restructuring and realignment plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure, improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness, strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers. We are also engaged in a multi-year effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies, including Finance, Human Resources and Procurement. Challenges with the enabling technologies and delays in implementing planned restructuring and realignment activities have delayed the realization of some the expected operational and financial benefits from such actions. As such, we may not be able to obtain all of the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and realignment plans. Additionally, as a result of these plans, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiencies during transitional periods and ongoing operations. Realignment and restructuring require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business.\nThe successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings, as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth. Factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees, the impact of regulatory matters including tax, matters involving certain third-party service providers selected to assist us, including staffing, technology, service providers\u2019 compliance with our internal controls over financial reporting, and adverse economic market conditions. If our restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully, it could have material adverse impacts on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, our competitive position, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur strategy includes acquisitions, and we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of other companies, assets, technologies, product lines and customer channels that either complement or expand our existing business or improve our competitive position. We may not be able to complete transactions with favorable terms or timing, or obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. In addition, our results of operations may be adversely impacted by: (i) the failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations, technology, and financial and other systems, (ii) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, which has led to, and in the future may lead to, accounting impairments, (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, control or compliance issues, or other issues for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing businesses and operations; insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting; the failure to realize expected synergies; the assumption of new material risks associated with the acquired businesses; and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses. Failure to successfully execute our growth strategy via acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquisitions could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nProduct defects, unanticipated use or inadequate disclosures with respect to our products could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nDefects, inadequacies or quality issues in the manufacture, design, software, security or service of our products (including in products, parts or components that we source from third parties), unanticipated use, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could result in product safety, product security, regulatory or environmental risks, including personal injury, death, property or environmental damage. These events could also lead to recalls, safety or security alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and/or result in warranty or liability claims against us. Although we have liability insurance, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any or all aspects of liability claims. Manufacturing, design, software, security or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages against us, warranty expenses or issuance of credits, which could impact our profitability. Recalls, removals, and warranty, liability and quality claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results can be difficult to predict.\nOur business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle, and book-and-bill business, which we have limited insight into, particularly for the business that we transact through our significant distribution network. We are also impacted by our long cycle business, including large projects, which could be unexpectedly cancelled, or whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project that are beyond our knowledge or control, such as funding, readiness of the project and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict.\nWeather conditions, including the effects of climate change, may cause volatility in several served markets, and may affect our financial results.\nThe unpredictable nature of weather conditions, including heavy flooding, prolonged droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, can positively or negatively impact portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers. For example, heavy flooding and rain events, which may be due to global climate change, may increase demand for some of our solutions that may help customers manage water and storm water overflows. Within the dewatering space, pumps provided through our Godwin and Flygt brands are used to remove and transfer excess or unwanted water. On the other hand, prolonged drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agriculture and turf irrigation applications, such as those provided by our Goulds Water Technology and Lowara brands. In addition, fluctuations in temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial hydronic applications, where homes and buildings use circulating water to heat and cool living spaces, such as those provided by our Bell & Gossett brand. Significant fluctuations in these weather conditions and climate changes can therefore result in volatility in our financial results.\nOur debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total outstanding indebtedness was $3,084 million as described under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\" and we may incur additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds;\n\u2022reducing or eliminating our ability to pay future dividends or repurchase our common stock;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments;\n\u2022reducing the cash flows available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes to grow business;\n\u2022increasing the amount of interest expense that we must pay because some of our borrowings are at variable interest rates, which, as interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense; and\n\u2022increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade, which could increase future debt costs and limit the availability of debt financing.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have.\nOur ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future cash flows from operations, which may not be sufficient and may be affected by factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur additional impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. As of December 31, 2020, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled approximately $3 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate it is\nmore likely than not that a potential impairment could exist. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business or our customers\u2019 business, inability to effectively integrate or scale acquired businesses, increases in cost of capital, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, failure of the FCC to renew radio spectrum licenses, divestitures and market capitalization declines may cause impairment of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. For example, in 2020 and 2019, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $58 million and $148 million, respectively, within our Measurement & Control Solutions segment primarily related to the performance of the business of the Pure Technologies Ltd. acquisition (\"Pure\") (as detailed in Note 12, \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d). Material impairment charges have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Tax\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations and policies, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other applicable anti-corruption laws, trade regulations, and data privacy and security laws, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nGiven our global operations, we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws and regulations related to anti-corruption, trade including export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local business customs and practices. We cannot guarantee that our internal controls, policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws, regulations or policies, including anti-corruption laws, we are required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business.\nAdditionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection and data security, including the California Consumer Protection Act and the EU's GDPR. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is evolving, often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. GDPR greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of EU law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the enforcement of data subject rights, enhanced security requirements, obligations to guarantee EU data subject rights are not compromised in countries outside the EU, and public disclosure of significant data breaches. Other countries, such as China, have enacted or are enacting data localization and security laws that require data to stay within their borders. All of these evolving legal and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions and/or civil penalties, damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 53% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. in 2020. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense, including:\n\u2022the geographic mix of jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed;\n\u2022the statutory tax rates and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022the resolution of tax issues arising from tax examinations by various tax authorities; and\n\u2022the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. The recent change in the U.S. Presidential administration increases the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in the U.S. federal tax laws and the interpretation or enforcement of legislation or directives by tax authorities.\nWe are regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could. For example, following an examination regarding aspects of the reorganization of our European business that occurred in 2013, the Swedish tax authority issued a tax assessment to Xylem\u2019s Swedish subsidiary in 2019, which we are appealing as further described in Note 7, \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d This examination as well as other examinations can result in increased tax assessments, and settlement or litigation about the assessments and final resolution could be adverse to Xylem. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits; however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect us. Although we believe our tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions, accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries, any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation. Changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other government policies, the nature, timing, and effect of which are uncertain, may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses (or the business operations of previously-owned entities). These proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters, tax, intellectual property, acquisitions or divestitures, product liability, property damage, personal injury, privacy, employment, labor and pensions, government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes. Our continued transition to connected and digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities.\nIt is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations, regulatory proceedings and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws, regulations or orders applicable to our business.\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations, coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe, means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInfringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us.\nWe own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, that are important to our business. Our intellectual property rights may provide us with competitive advantage because they may help us differentiate our technologies, products and services, including our growing portfolio of data analytics and digitally-enabled offerings. However, our current or future intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, misappropriated, independently developed, or designed-around, particularly given our international operations in countries where laws governing intellectual property rights are not highly developed, protected or enforced. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property, or detect or prevent circumvention, misappropriation or unauthorized use of such property, as well as the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity and uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to use critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required\nto pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the use of third-party intellectual property rights, or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopments in, and compliance with, current and future environmental and climate change laws and regulations could impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business, operations, and product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those enacted in response to climate change concerns.\nClimate change is receiving ever increasing attention globally as many governments, scientists and organizations, such as the United Nations, warn of the effects on our climate of increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Increased public and governmental awareness and concern regarding global climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and will likely result in increasing environmental and climate change laws or regulations. Compliance with these current and future laws and regulations currently requires, and is expected to continue to require, increasing operating and capital expenditures which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, President Biden's administration may increase the likelihood of potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any existing or new legislation or directives by government authorities.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations. Developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Spin-off from ITT may expose us to potential liabilities.\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis (acquired by Harris Corporation, now L3Harris Technologies, Inc.), ITT and Exelis agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify ITT and Exelis for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide ITT and Exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ITT or Exelis agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnities from ITT and Exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ITT and Exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from ITT and Exelis any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022success or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022our ability to achieve long-term financial or non-financial (including sustainability) targets;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022stock repurchases or payment of dividends;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards or technologies, product and service offerings;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or guidance by us or securities analysts or our ability to meet such guidance and estimates;\n\u2022our ability to execute restructuring and realignment actions;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022natural or environmental disasters or climate change considerations that investors believe may affect us;\n\u2022uncertainty or instability arising from the global geopolitical environment or events, COVID-19 or other actual or potential pandemics;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency impacts;\n\u2022fluctuations in the budgets or spending of federal, state and local governmental entities around the world;\n\u2022results from any material litigation, governmental or regulatory body investigation, or tax examination;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022impact of trade protection measures including tariffs; and\n\u2022overall market fluctuations or general economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13035, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "XYL"}
