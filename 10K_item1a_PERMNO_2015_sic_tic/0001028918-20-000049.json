RISK FACTORS\nOwnership of our common stock involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe economic environment could pose significant challenges for the Company and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the U.S. economy, generally, and markets we serve, specifically. We primarily serve markets in California, though certain of our products and services are offered nationwide. Although the U.S. economy continues to expand, the duration and magnitude of its expansion is uncertain. Financial stress on borrowers as a result of an uncertain future economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s borrowers and their ability to repay their loans, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. A weakening of these conditions in the markets in which we operate would likely have an adverse effect on us and others in the financial institutions industry. For example, deterioration in economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our financial statements. Additionally, on January 1, 2020, we were required to implement the provisions of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the way we estimate credit losses by replacing the incurred loss model used to determine the allowance for loan losses (\u201cALLL\u201d) with the current expected credit losses model. The CECL model requires the Company to estimate and provide for expected future credit losses over the lives of financial assets, such as loans, and also requires the Company to incorporate the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts when estimating credit losses. As such, adverse changes in economic conditions or expected economic conditions may require the Company provide for a significantly greater allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d). We may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that negatively affect real estate values and the job market may result, in the deterioration of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, and such deterioration in credit quality could have a negative impact on our business;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022\na decrease in deposit balances, including low-cost and non-interest bearing deposits, due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by commercial or residential real estate;\n\u2022\na decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022\nsustained weakness in our markets may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities;\n\u2022\nthe processes we use to estimate ALLL (and ACL under the CECL methodology beginning on January 1, 2020) and reserves may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation; and\n\u2022\nour ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the methodologies and approaches we use become less effective in controlling charge-offs.\nAs these conditions or similar ones exist or worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions in California may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and reduce the value of the assets we hold as collateral.\nOur business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in California. Difficult economic conditions in California may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. In addition, demand for our products and services may decline. Declines in the California real estate market could hurt our business, because the majority of our loans are secured by real estate located within California. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 58% of the aggregate outstanding principal of our loans was secured by real estate were located in California. If real estate values were to decline in California, the collateral for our loans would provide less security. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nChanges in U.S trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the U.S. presidential election in 2016, there have been changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting China and retaliatory tariffs by China. Tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export, including among others, agricultural and technological products, could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt; this, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact our and our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers\u2019 products, and the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio in excess of losses previously provided for.\nOur total nonperforming assets amounted to $9.1 million, or 0.08% of our total assets, at December 31, 2019, an increase from $5.0 million or 0.04% at December 31, 2018. We had $7.5 million of net loan charge-offs for 2019, an increase from $1.0 million in 2018. Our provision for loan losses was $7.1 million in 2019, a decrease from $8.2 million in 2018. If increases in our nonperforming assets occur in the future, our net loan charge-offs and/or provision for loan losses may also increase which may have an adverse effect upon our future results of operations and capital.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices generally include analysis of a borrower\u2019s prior credit history, available cash flow (determined using financial statements and tax returns) and cash flow projections, valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and liquid asset verifications. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria but subsequently deteriorate, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ALLL (and ACL under the CECL methodology beginning on January 1, 2020). Our ALLL is based on analysis of the following:\n\u2022\nhistorical experience with our loans;\n\u2022\nindustry historical losses as reported by the FDIC;\n\u2022\ninternal credit risk grades of loans in our loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nevaluation of current economic conditions;\n\u2022\nregular reviews of the quality, mix and size of our loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nregular reviews of delinquencies;\n\u2022\nthe quality of the collateral underlying our loans; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of external factors, such as competition, legal developments and regulatory requirements.\nAs previously mentioned, on January 1, 2020, we changed the way we estimate credit losses by replacing the incurred loss model used to determine the allowance for loan losses, or ALLL, with the current expected credit losses, or CECL, model. The CECL model not only incorporates certain facets of the incurred loss ALLL model, as listed above, but also incorporates the use of and is more reliant on reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions, including, but not limited to: forecasts of GDP growth rates, levels of unemployment, vacancy rates, and changes in the value of commercial real estate properties.\nBased on our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and management\u2019s current expectation of future economic conditions, and certain qualitative adjustments, which we are currently working to refine, the Company believes its cumulative effect adjustment, resulting from the adoption of the CECL model, will result in a pre-tax increase in the ALLL by an amount within a range of $50 million and $60 million. As economic conditions change, the Company may be required to provide for significantly higher credit losses and may experience volatility in the provision for credit losses.\nAlthough we maintain an ALLL at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio (and future expected credit losses under the CECL model, beginning January 1, 2020), changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including a sharp decline in real estate values and changes in interest rates, which are beyond our control, may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates, which will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve and the DBO, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our credit loss reserves. Either agency may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses, based on their judgments, which may be different from those of our management and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to specific segments of our loan portfolio may result in losses that could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral economic conditions and local economic conditions, changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, and increases in interest rates and tax rates affect our entire loan portfolio. In addition, lending risks vary by the type of loan extended.\nIn our C&I and SBA lending activities, collectability of loans may be adversely affected by risks generally related to small and middle market businesses, such as:\n\u2022\nchanges or weaknesses in specific industry segments, including weakness affecting the business\u2019 customer base;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer behavior and a business\u2019s personnel;\n\u2022\nincreases in supplier costs and operating costs that cannot be passed along to customers; and\n\u2022\nchanges in competition.\nIn our investor real estate and construction loans, payment performance and the liquidation values of collateral properties may be adversely affected by risks generally incidental to interests in real property (for investor real estate and CRE construction loans) or risks generally related to consumers (for single family residence construction loans), such as:\n\u2022\ndeclines in real estate values, rental rates and occupancy rates;\n\u2022\nincreases in other operating expenses (including energy costs);\n\u2022\ndemand for the type of property or high-end home in question; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of property financing.\nIn our owner-occupied CRE lending activities, probability of default may be adversely affected by the risks described above for C&I and SBA lending, while loss given defaults may be adversely affected by the risks described above affecting collateral value for investor real estate.\nIn our HOA and consumer loans, collectability of the loans may be adversely affected by risks generally related to consumers, such as:\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer behavior and changes or weakness in employment and wage income;\n\u2022\ndeclines in real estate values or rental rates;\n\u2022\nincreases in association operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of property financing.\nIn our agribusiness and farmland loans, collectability of the loans may be adversely affected by risks generally related to agriculture production and farmlands, such as:\n\u2022\nthe cyclical nature of the agriculture industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuating commodity prices;\n\u2022\nchanging climatic conditions, including drought conditions, which adversely impact agricultural customers\u2019 operating costs, crop yields and crop quality and could impact such customers\u2019 ability to repay loans;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on agricultural products and materials that our clients import or export; and\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses and changes in real estate values.\nOur level of credit risk could increase due to our focus on commercial lending and the concentration on small and middle market business customers, who can have heightened vulnerability to economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $3.86 billion, or 44.2% of our total loan portfolio, and our commercial business loans amounted to $4.16 billion, or 47.6% of our total loan portfolio. At such date, our largest outstanding C&I loan was $63.9 million, our largest multiple borrower relationship was $126.3 million and our largest outstanding CRE loan was $94.1 million. CRE and commercial business loans are generally considered riskier than single-family residential loans because they have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. CRE and commercial business loans involve risks because the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans typically depends primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans. Most of the Company\u2019s commercial business loans are made to small or middle market business customers who may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nNonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d), which adversely affects our income. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. While we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in nonperforming assets.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions, whether in our systems or those of our contracted partners, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.\nDespite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Like many financial institutions, we can be subject to attempts to infiltrate the security of our websites or other systems which can involve sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. We can be targeted by individuals and groups using malicious code and viruses, and can be exposed to distributed denial-of-service attacks with the objective of disrupting on-line banking services.\nDespite efforts to ensure the security and integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside our business, especially because the techniques used frequently are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including individuals or groups who are or may be involved in organized crime, hostile foreign governments or linked to terrorist organizations. These risks may increase in the future as our web-based product offerings grow or we expand internal usage of web-based applications.\nIn addition, we outsource a significant portion of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If any of these third-party providers encounters difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. We do not have direct control over the systems of these vendors and third-party providers and, were they to suffer a breach, our sensitive data, including customer information, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems or the systems of another market participant, our vendors or third party providers, which we refer to generally as a data breach, could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to computers or systems, and may result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws (including, but not limited to, the California Privacy Act), financial loss, loss of confidence, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nAny such data breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, including regulatory mandates specific to the financial services industry, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nThere is potential of an account takeover of any of our clients\u2019 accounts, whereby a hacker could illegally use malware on a client\u2019s computer or other device to gain access to the client\u2019s bank accounts and other information. Although such attacks are focused on the client, not the bank, a successful account take over attack can lead to fraudulent bank transactions that we may not catch in time.\nWe devote significant resources to protecting our and our customers\u2019 information. To the extent that the expenses associated with these and future protective measures increase, our non-interest expenses may increase overall, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we maintain cyber risk insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are reasonable based upon the scope of our activities. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from future data breaches of our systems or the systems of another market participant or our vendors or third party providers. If our cyber risk insurance is insufficient with respect to covering all of the losses resulting from any such future data breach, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting policies, standards and interpretations could materially affect how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU replaces the incurred loss impairment model in current United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) with a model that reflects current expected credit losses. The CECL model will apply to most debt instruments, including loan receivables, loan commitments and held-to-maturity debt securities. The FASB has issued additional ASUs since, including 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326 - Credit Losses, Topic 815 - Derivatives and Hedging and Topic 825 - Financial Instruments; ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):Targeted Transition Relief; and ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326. Each update serves to clarify certain aspects of the CECL model.\nUnder the CECL model, the Company will recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of future expected credit losses over the life of financial assets, such as loans and debt securities, as of the end of the reporting period. Measuring future expected credit losses will likely be a significant challenge for all entities, including the Company.\nThe ACL measured under a CECL model could differ materially from the ALLL measured under the Company\u2019s incurred loss model. To initially apply the CECL amendments, for most debt instruments, the Company will record a cumulative-effect adjustment to its statement of financial condition as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (a modified retrospective approach). The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The implementation of CECL may require us to increase our loan loss allowance, may decrease our reported income, and may introduce additional volatility into our reported earnings.\nAdditionally, the CECL model changes how the Company accounts for certain financial assets, such as loans and debt securities, acquired in a business combination or other purchase, that have not experienced a more-than-insignificant amount of deterioration in credit quality since their origination (\u201cnon-credit deteriorated financial assets\u201d). Under the CECL model, the Company is required to estimate and record an ACL for future expected credit losses over the life of non-credit deteriorated financial assets on the date of acquisition through a charge to provision for credit losses. As a result, the implementation of CECL may require us to recognize significant provisions for credit losses in connection with a business combination or other purchase of certain financial assets.\nOn December 21, 2018, federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule, effective as of April 1, 2019, modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a three-year period the initial regulatory capital effects of the CECL methodology. The Company is currently evaluating the day-one regulatory capital effects and phase-in option upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company was required to adopt the provisions of ASC Topic 842, Leases, which changed the way we account for leases by requiring previously unrecorded off-balance sheet lease obligations and corresponding rights to use underlying leased assets to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 842, the Company may be required to recognize additional right-of-use assets and liabilities for the obligations to make future lease payments when entering into future lease agreements or when assuming lease obligations through the acquisition of other financial institutions.\nChanges in monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but also our ability to originate loans and deposits. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for loans and interest rates. Loan origination volume usually declines during periods of rising or high interest rates and increases during periods of declining or low interest rates. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of certain of our assets, including loans, real estate and investment securities, on our balance sheet. We may incur debt in the future and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates.\nFurther, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for us, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented by the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the federal funds rate target, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our borrowers, and therefore on our results of operations.\nInterest rate changes, increases or decreases, which are out of our control, could harm profitability.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and dividends we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Any change in general market interest rates, whether as a result of changes in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or otherwise, may have a significant effect on net interest income and prepayments on our loans.\nDuring the third and fourth quarters of 2019, in response to changing economic conditions, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Open Market Committee reduced its federal funds rate target from a range of 2.25% - 2.50%, that was in effect through August 2019, to the current target range of 1.50% - 1.75%, that was in effect since October 31, 2019. Moreover, since December 2015, the Federal Reserve has removed reserves from the banking system, which also puts upward pressure on market rates of interest. In addition, the prohibition restricting depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits, such as checking accounts, was repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nOur assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall interest rates or conditions. In general, higher interest rates are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Further, if interest rates decline, our loans may be refinanced at lower rates or paid off and our investments may be prepaid earlier than expected. If that occurs, we may have to redeploy the loan or investment proceeds into lower yielding assets, which might also decrease our income. Also, as many of our loans currently have interest rate floors, a rise in rates may increase the cost of our deposits while the rates on the loans remain at their floors, which could decrease our net interest income. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, loan origination volumes, net interest margin, results of operations and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is low in a rising interest rate environment based on the current profile of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and low-cost and no-cost deposits. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d At December 31, 2019, we had $586.0 million in interest-bearing demand deposits. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had $3.41 billion in money market and savings deposits. If the interest rates on our loans increase comparably faster than the interest rate on our interest- bearing demand deposits, money market and savings deposits, our core deposit balances may decrease as customers use those funds to repay higher cost loans. In addition, if we need to offer additional interest-bearing demand deposit products or higher interest rates on our current interest-bearing demand, money market or savings deposit accounts in order to maintain current customers or attract new customers, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer competitive rates sufficient to retain these accounts, our core deposits may be reduced, which would require us to seek alternative funding sources or risk slowing our future asset growth. In these circumstances, our net interest income may decrease, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs interest rates rise, our existing borrowers who have adjustable rate loans may see their loan payments increase and, as a result, may experience difficulty repaying those loans, which in turn could lead to higher losses for us. Increasing delinquencies, non-accrual loans and defaults lead to higher loan loss provisions, and potentially greater eventual losses that would lower our current profitability and capital ratios.\nConditions in the financial markets may limit our access to additional funding to meet our liquidity needs.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, as we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include a reduction in our credit ratings, if any, an increase in costs of capital in financial capital markets, negative operating results, a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn, a decrease in depositor or investor confidence or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole.\nOur ability to obtain funding from the FHLB or through its overnight federal funds lines with other banks could be negatively affected if we experienced a substantial deterioration in the Company\u2019s financial condition or if such funding became restricted due to deterioration in the financial markets. While the Company has a contingency funds management plan to address such a situation if it were to occur (such plan includes deposit promotions, the sale of securities and the curtailment of loan growth, if necessary), a significant decrease in our ability to borrow funds could adversely affect our liquidity.\nAs a commercial banking institution, we compete with our market peers in, among other things, attracting, maintaining and increasing customer deposits. We are currently part of a highly competitive local deposit market, in which our competitors are offering ever increasing deposit rates in order to attract new deposits. Given our large proportion of non-maturity deposits, we could experience significant and acute deposit outflows if our offered deposit rates do not remain competitive in our primary market. Such outflows could adversely affect our liquidity.\nFurther, depending on these competitive factors and the interest rate environment, lower cost deposits may need to be replaced with higher cost funding, resulting in a decrease in net interest income and net income. While these events could have a material impact on our results, we expect, in the ordinary course of business, that these deposits will fluctuate and believe the Company is capable of mitigating this risk, as well as the risk of losing one of these depositors, through additional liquidity, and business generation in the future. However, should a significant number of these customers leave the Bank, it could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and the Company.\nThe financial condition of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel.\nOur future operating results depend in large part on the continued services of our key personnel, including Steven R. Gardner, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who developed and implemented our business strategy. The loss of Mr. Gardner could have a negative impact on the success of our business strategy. In addition, we rely upon the services of Edward Wilcox, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Bank, and Ronald Nicolas, Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation and the Bank, and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the successful development of our business. The unexpected loss of services of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, recent regulatory proposals and guidance relating to compensation may negatively impact our ability to retain and attract skilled personnel.\nOur controls, processes and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure processes and procedures, compliance monitoring activities and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition and/or result in materially inaccurate reported financial statements. In addition, if we identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, it would necessitate remedial measures that may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business or subject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Further, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and potentially subject us to litigation\nA natural disaster or recurring energy shortage, especially in California, could harm our business.\nWe are based in Irvine, California and, at December 31, 2019, approximately 58% of the aggregate outstanding principal of our loans was tied to businesses or secured by real estate located in California. In addition, the computer systems that operate our Internet websites and some of their back-up systems are located in Irvine, California. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and mudslides. Certain of these natural disasters may be exacerbated by changing climate conditions. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our information technology structure and websites, which could prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan portfolio. Uninsured or underinsured disasters may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters or recurring power outages may diminish the profitability of our business borrowers and reduce their ability to repay business loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. California has also experienced energy and water shortages, which, if they recur, could impair the value of the real estate in those areas affected. The occurrence of natural disasters or energy shortages in California could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental liabilities with respect to properties on which we take title may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough we perform limited environmental due diligence in conjunction with originating loans secured by properties we believe have environmental risk, such diligence may not reflect all current risks or threats, and unforeseen or unpredictable future events may cause a change in the environmental risk profile of a property after a loan has been made. Consequently, we could be subject to environmental liabilities on real estate properties we foreclose upon and take title to in the normal course of our business. In connection with environmental contamination, we may be held liable to governmental entities or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances at a property. The investigation or remediation costs associated with such activities could be substantial. Furthermore, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination even if we were the former owner of a contaminated site. The incurrence of a significant environmental liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete with financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.\nWe face direct competition from a significant number of financial institutions, many with a state-wide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence, in both originating loans and attracting deposits. Competition in originating loans comes primarily from other banks and finance companies, and more recently, financial technology (or \u201cfintech\u201d) companies, that make loans in our primary market areas. In addition banks with larger capitalizations and non-bank financial institutions that are not governed by bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are better able to serve the needs of larger customers. Many of these financial institutions are also significantly larger than us, have greater financial resources than we have, have established customer bases and name recognition. We compete for loans principally on the basis of interest rates and loan fees, the types of loans we offer and the quality of service that we provide to our borrowers. We also face substantial competition in attracting deposits from other banking institutions, money market and mutual funds, credit unions and other investment vehicles. Our ability to attract and retain deposits requires that we provide customers with competitive investment opportunities with respect to rate of return, liquidity, risk and other factors. To effectively compete, we may have to pay higher rates of interest to attract deposits, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, we rely upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by our officers, directors and employees and specialized services tailored to meet the individual needs of our customers in order to compete. If we are not able to effectively compete in our market area, our profitability may be negatively affected.\nOur ability to attract and maintain customer and investor relationships depends largely on our reputation.\nDamage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers and investors in our ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described in this report, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, customer personal information and privacy issues, customer and other third-party fraud, record-keeping, technology-related issues including but not limited to cyber fraud, regulatory investigations, unethical practices, employee mistakes, misconduct or fraud, and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental scrutiny and regulation. Maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on our brands and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property. Defense of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Federal and state banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to conduct certain activities, including acquisitions, we are required to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that any required approvals can be obtained, or obtained without conditions or on a timeframe acceptable to us.\nBecause our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are continuously reviewed and change frequently. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. There can be no assurance that laws, rules and regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our ability to originate, modify, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) restrict our ability to collect on defaulted loans or foreclose on property securing loans, (iv) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (v) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business. These risks could affect our deposit funding and the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which could negatively affect our financial performance and financial condition.\nWhile recent federal legislation has scaled back portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the current administration in the United States may further roll back or modify certain of the regulations adopted since the financial crisis, including those adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime, may negatively impact our business, at least in the short-term, even if the long-term impact of any such changes are positive for our business.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements as our total assets exceed $10 billion.\nWith the acquisition of Grandpoint capital Inc. (\u201cGrandpoint\u201d) on July 1, 2018, our total assets exceeded $10 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including a more frequent and enhanced regulatory examination regime. In addition, banks, including ours, with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, with the Federal Reserve maintaining supervision over some consumer related regulations. Previously, the Federal Reserve has been primarily responsible for examining our Bank\u2019s compliance with consumer protection laws. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is some uncertainty as to how the CFPB examination and regulatory authority might impact our business.\nOne key Dodd-Frank Act requirement applicable to banks with $10 billion or more in total assets has been compulsory stress testing (Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test or \u201cDFAST\u201d). The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law on May 24, 2018, increased the asset threshold at which company-run stress tests are required from $10 billion to $250 billion. The elimination of DFAST has not eliminated the expectation of the regulatory agencies that we will conduct enhanced capital stress testing. However, standards establishing the framework surrounding such expectations have not been announced. The unknown nature and extent of future stress testing requirements creates uncertainty with respect to the impact of those requirements on our business.\nSince July 1, 2019, we became subject to reduced interchange income, which has resulted in reduced revenues. Debit card interchange fee restrictions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, which is known as the Durbin Amendment, as implemented by regulations of the Federal Reserve, cap the maximum debit interchange fee that a bank debit card issuer with $10 billion or more in total assets may receive per transaction at the sum of $0.21 plus five basis points. A debit card issuer that adopts certain fraud prevention procedures may charge an additional $0.01 per transaction. Based on current debit card volume, we have experienced a reduction of approximately $1.4 million in debit card related fee income and pre-tax earnings following the application of the Durbin Amendment to the Company beginning July 1, 2019.\nCompliance with stress testing requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nFederal and state regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the DBO, and the CFPB periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a regulatory agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Bank or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business.\nWe have consummated ten acquisitions since 2010. Most recently, on July 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Grandpoint, the holding company of Grandpoint Bank, a California state-chartered bank with $3.2 billion in total assets. On January 31, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with Opus, pursuant to which we will acquire Opus, a California-chartered state bank with $8.0 billion in total assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to the receipt all required regulatory and stockholder approvals and the satisfaction or waiver, if applicable, of all closing conditions.\nThe success of the Opus acquisition or any future acquisition we may consummate will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize the anticipated revenue enhancements and efficiencies and to combine our business with the business of the target institution in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of either institution, or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers, and that permits growth opportunities to occur. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the subject acquisition, including the Opus acquisition, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIt is possible that the integration process associated with any pending or future acquisition could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Integration efforts could also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined company.\nAcquisitions may dilute stockholder value.\nThe acquisition of Opus will be an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $1.0 billion as of the date of signing. The consideration payable to Opus shareholders upon consummation of the acquisition will consist of whole shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock. We anticipate issuing approximately 34.7 million shares of common stock to Opus shareholders in connection with the acquisition, and we anticipate that the transaction will result in initial tangible book value dilution of 2.8%, or $0.53 per share at the time of closing with an earnback period of 1.8 years.\nFuture mergers or acquisitions, if any, may involve cash, debt or equity securities as transaction consideration. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our stock\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. We cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate, or if consummated, successfully integrate the Opus acquisition or any future acquisition, or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from pending or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nWhen the Company acquires a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price, which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $891.6 million of goodwill and intangible assets, which includes goodwill of approximately $808.3 million resulting from the acquisitions the Company has consummated since 2011. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but rather be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. In testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, which considers the impact that various relevant economic, industry, market and company specific factors may have on the value of the Company. The Company\u2019s qualitative assessment considers known positive and negative as well as any mitigating events and circumstances associated with each relevant factor that may be deemed to have an impact on the value of the Company. Should the Company\u2019s qualitative assessment indicate the value of goodwill and intangible assets could be impaired, a quantitative assessment is then performed to determine if there is impairment. This assessment involves determining the fair value of the reporting unit (which in our case is the Company) and comparing that determination of fair value to the carrying value of the Company in order to quantify the amount of possible impairment. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates and other external factors (such as natural disasters or significant world events) may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions and result in an impairment charge at a future date. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill or intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in the fair value of our investment securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2019, $1.37 billion of our securities were classified as available-for-sale with an aggregate net unrealized gain of $30.1 million. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the case of equity securities, which have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had stock holdings in the FHLB of San Francisco totaling $17.3 million, $51.7 million in FRB stock, and $24.1 million in other stock, all carried at cost. The stock held by us is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our stock holdings. There can be no assurance that future negative changes to the financial condition of the issuers may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such stock holdings.\nIncreased regulatory oversight and uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Efforts in the United States to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and to a lesser extent securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities. If LIBOR rates are no longer available or do not remain an acceptable market benchmark, any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently, which may adversely affect our revenue or our expenses. We may incur significant costs to transition both our borrowing arrangements and the loan agreements with our customers from LIBOR, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we may face exposure to litigation over the nature and performance of any replacement index. The impact of alternatives to LIBOR on the valuations, pricing and operation of our financial instruments is not yet known.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock, like many of our peers, has fluctuated significantly over the recent past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nStock price volatility may make it difficult for holders of our common stock to resell their common stock when desired and at desirable prices. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nInaccurate management decisions regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired which could materially affect our financial condition;\n\u2022\nNatural disasters, fires, and severe weather;\n\u2022\nInternal controls may fail;\n\u2022\nReliance on other companies to provide key components of our business processes;\n\u2022\nMeeting capital adequacy standards and the need to raise additional capital in the future if needed, including through future sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nRecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nFailure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, us;\n\u2022\nOperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions in the current economic downturn;\n\u2022\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nDeparture of our management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nCyber security breaches of the company or contracted partners;\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nExisting or increased regulatory and compliance requirements, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nLitigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nChanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical and public health conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts and pandemics.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results as evidenced by the current volatility and disruption of capital and credit markets.\nThe primary source of the Company\u2019s liquidity from which, among other things, dividends to shareholders may be paid is the receipt of dividends from the Bank.\nWe recently initiated the paying of a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders is dependent upon receiving dividends from the Bank. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to restrictions set forth in the Financial Code. The Financial Code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of (1) a bank\u2019s retained earnings and (2) a bank\u2019s net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank to the shareholders of the bank during such period. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DBO, make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (a) its retained earnings; (b) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (c) its net income for its current fiscal year. In the event that banking regulators determine that the stockholders\u2019 equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound, the regulators may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution.\nApproval of the Federal Reserve is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as the Bank, if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits without regulatory and stockholder approval. The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends from the Bank to the Corporation could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on common stock.\nOur shareholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have only recently begun to declare cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Delaware law, by the Federal Reserve, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures. Notification to the Federal Reserve is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our shareholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend if the Federal Reserve objects or until such time as we receive approval from the Federal Reserve or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to our shareholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on our common stock at current levels or at all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85020, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PPBI"}
