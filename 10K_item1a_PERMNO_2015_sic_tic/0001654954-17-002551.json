You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information in this filing before deciding to invest in our company. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently considered to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the trading price or value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nContinuation of the recent declines, or further declines, in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices, will adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations or targets and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, access to capital, present value and quality of our reserves, the nature and scale of our operations and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. In recent years, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Because approximately 58% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 were oil, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. Since mid-2014, the price of crude oil has significantly declined. As a result, we experienced significant decreases in crude oil revenues and recorded asset impairment charges driven by commodity price declines. A prolonged period of low market prices for oil and natural gas, like the current commodity price environment, or further declines in the market prices for oil and natural gas, will likely result in capital expenditures being further curtailed and will adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity and our ability to meet obligations, targets or financial commitments and could ultimately lead to restructuring or filing for bankruptcy, which would have a material adverse effect on our stock price and indebtedness. Additionally, lower oil and natural gas prices may cause further decline in our stock price. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $54.01 per Bbl to a low of $26.19 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas Henry Hub spot price ranged from a high of $3.59 per MMBtu to a low of $1.73 per MMBtu.\nWe have a limited operating history and expect to continue to incur losses for an indeterminable period of time.\nWe have a limited operating history and are engaged in the initial stages of exploration, development and exploitation of our leasehold acreage and will continue to be so until commencement of substantial production from our oil and natural gas properties, which will depend upon successful drilling results, additional and timely capital funding, and access to suitable infrastructure. Companies in their initial stages of development face substantial business risks and may suffer significant losses. We have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in the past and expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we continue our drilling program. In considering an investment in our common stock, you should consider that there is only limited historical and financial operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance. We have incurred net losses of $101,731,000 from the date of inception (February 9, 2011) through December 31, 2016. Additionally, we are dependent on obtaining additional debt and/or equity financing to roll-out and scale our planned principal business operations. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters consist principally of seeking additional debt and/or equity financing combined with expected cash flows from current oil and gas assets held and additional oil and gas assets that we may acquire. Our efforts may not be successful and funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe face challenges and uncertainties in financial planning as a result of the unavailability of historical data and uncertainties regarding the nature, scope and results of our future activities. New companies must develop successful business relationships, establish operating procedures, hire staff, install management information and other systems, establish facilities and obtain licenses, as well as take other measures necessary to conduct their intended business activities. We may not be successful in implementing our business strategies or in completing the development of the infrastructure necessary to conduct our business as planned. In the event that one or more of our drilling programs is not completed or is delayed or terminated, our operating results will be adversely affected and our operations will differ materially from the activities described in this Annual Report. As a result of industry factors or factors relating specifically to us, we may have to change our methods of conducting business, which may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The uncertainty and risks described in this Annual Report may impede our ability to economically find, develop, exploit and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by our operating activities in the future.\nWe will need additional capital to complete future acquisitions, conduct our operations and fund our business and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain.\nWe will need to raise additional funding to complete future potential acquisitions and will be required to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our operations, acquire assets and complete exploration and drilling operations. In such a case, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. If we need to raise additional funds in the future by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders will result, and such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future and we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from new business arrangements, to complete planned acquisitions or operations, our results of operations and the value of our securities could be adversely affected.\nWe require significant additional financing to pay our outstanding liabilities and in the event we cannot raise additional funding or undertake a business combination transaction prior to the due date of such liabilities, we may be forced to sell assets, our debtors may foreclose on our assets or we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.\nWe currently have significant indebtedness and our debt agreements require us to use a significant portion of our revenues to pay down our outstanding debt. Due to the nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production generally decline over time as oil and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to drill additional wells and develop our reserves, either because we are unable to raise sufficient funding for such development activities, or otherwise, or in the event we are unable to acquire additional operating properties, we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time. Furthermore, in the event we are unable to raise additional funding in the future, we will not be able to participate in the drilling of additional wells, will not be able to complete other drilling and/or workover activities, and may not be able to make required payments on our outstanding liabilities. We are currently working to complete the GOM Merger, which we believe will provide us additional capital, but in the event we are unable to raise necessary funding in the future or complete a business combination or similar transaction in the near term, we may not be able to pay our debts (or make required amortization and principal payments on such debts) as they come due or continue to drill wells and/or participate in their drilling.\nIf this were to happen, we may be forced to scale back our business plan, sell or liquidate assets to satisfy outstanding debts (or our creditors may undertake a foreclosure of such assets in order to satisfy amounts we owe to such creditors, with or without our assistance) and/or take other steps which may include seeking bankruptcy protection, all of which could result in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and other obligations due to events beyond our control.\nOur ability to generate cash flows from operations, to make scheduled payments on or refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our future financial performance and our ability to generate cash in the future. Our future financial performance will be affected by a range of economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors that we cannot control, such as general economic, legislative, regulatory and financial conditions in our industry, the economy generally, the price of oil and other risks described below. A significant reduction in operating cash flows resulting from changes in economic, legislative or regulatory conditions, increased competition or other events beyond our control could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, seeking additional capital, or any combination of the foregoing. If we raise additional debt, it would increase our interest expense, leverage and our operating and financial costs. We cannot assure you that any of these alternative strategies could be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that they would yield sufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Reducing or delaying capital expenditures or selling assets could delay future cash flows. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all of our outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable. This would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between our applicable debt agreements. Under these circumstances, our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings. In addition, the lenders under our credit facilities or other secured indebtedness could seek to foreclose on our assets that are their collateral. If the amounts outstanding under our indebtedness were to be accelerated, or were the subject of foreclosure actions, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.\nOur Tranche A Notes and Tranche B Notes include various covenants, reduces our financial flexibility, increases our interest expense and may adversely impact our operations and our costs.\nIn connection with our acquisition of certain assets from Continental on March 7, 2014, we entered into a senior debt facility pursuant to which we borrowed $34.5 million initially and have subsequently borrowed an additional $2.0 million (our \u201cTranche B Notes\u201d) which amounts represent a significant amount of indebtedness. In addition, in connection with our Senior Debt Restructuring in May 2016, we borrowed an additional $6.4 million (our \u201cTranche A Notes,\u201d and together with our Tranche B Notes, our \u201csenior debt facility\u201d), leaving approximately $18.0 million available for future drilling operations thereunder, subject to the terms and conditions of such facility which amounts also represent a significant amount of indebtedness.\nThis senior debt facility includes various covenants (positive and negative) binding us, including:\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we maintain the registration of our common stock under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we provide the lenders yearly and quarterly budgets and certain reserve reports;\n\u25cf\nrequiring that we provide capital expenditure plans to the lenders prior to making certain expenditures;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting us and our subsidiaries from creating or becoming subject to any indebtedness, except pursuant to certain limited exceptions; and\n\u25cf\nprohibiting us or our subsidiaries from merging, selling assets (except in the usual course of business), altering our organizational structure, winding up or liquidating, except in certain limited circumstances.\nOur senior debt facility affects our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf\na significant portion of our cash flows must be used to service the debt facility, with the Company required to pay all of its oil and gas revenues on a monthly basis to the lenders, subject to a monthly general and administrative expense (\u201cG&A\u201d) cap of $150,000 which is permitted to be applied against Company general and administrative expenses. See \u201cPart I, Item 1. Business\u201d - \u201cRecent Developments\u201d - \u201cSenior Debt Restructuring\u201d);\n\u25cf\nthe high level of debt could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments; and\n\u25cf\nthe debt covenants may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nThe high level of indebtedness under our senior debt facility increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, all revenues we do generate above $150,000 per month will be required to be used to repay the debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing to pay the interest or principal due on the debt, fund our business plan and satisfy our other obligations and liabilities, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently have any commitments of additional capital except pursuant to the terms of these debt facilities. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we choose to raise additional capital through the sale of other debt or equity securities, such sales may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.\nA portion of our Tranche B Notes, our junior debt held by RJC, and all of our Series A Convertible Preferred stock are held by entities whose parent company is in liquidation, which may have a negative impact on the Company and its business.\nEach of GOM, RJC and GGE are owned by Partners Value Arbitrage Fund, LP, a New York based investment firm (\u201cPPVAF\u201d), and were formerly advised by Platinum Management (NY), LLC (\u201cPM LLC\u201d). PPVAF, and, by virtue of being owned by PPVAF, GGE, RJC, and GOM, are currently in the process of winding down and liquidating their assets through the oversight and control of a court-appointed liquidator in the Cayman Islands and are no longer advised by PM LLC or any of its affiliates. Additionally, the Company is aware that the former manager of PPVAF, PM LLC, is currently under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department and that certain former executives have been indicted by the Justice Department, however, PM LLC and those certain executives no longer have any control over PPVAF, GOM, RJC or GGE, which entities are currently solely under the control of the Cayman Islands court-appointed liquidators. While the Company does not foresee that the confluence of these events or control of these entities by the court-appointed liquidator will disrupt or have a negative impact on the Company or its business, these extraordinary events may have a negative impact on the Company and its business, including, but not limited to, potential inability or delays in the Company\u2019s efforts to restructure Company debt and equity controlled by the liquidator or consummate the GOM Merger.\nThe repayment of our senior debt facility is secured by a security interest in all of our assets.\nThe repayment of our senior debt facility (which has an outstanding principal balance of approximately $48.95 million as of March 1, 2017 and provides us the option, pursuant to the terms of the debt facility, to borrow an additional approximately $18.0 million) is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets, property, real property and the securities of our subsidiaries and the repayment of such debt is further guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. If we default in the repayment of the senior debt facility and/or any of the terms and conditions thereof, the lenders may enforce their security interest over our assets which secure the repayment of such debt, and we could be forced to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in the Company could become worthless.\nThe occurrence of an event of default under the notes sold in connection with our senior debt facility could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nThe notes issued in connection with our senior debt facility include standard and customary events of default, including, among other things, our or any subsidiary\u2019s default in the payment of any indebtedness under any agreement, or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of any other agreement related to indebtedness or otherwise, if the effect of such failure or default, is to cause, or permit the holder or holders thereof, or any counterparty to an agreement relating to indebtedness, to cause indebtedness, or amounts due thereunder, in an aggregate amount of $250,000 or more to become due prior to its stated date of maturity or the date such amount would otherwise have been due notwithstanding such default, subject to certain exclusions; the loss, suspension or revocation of, or failure to renew, any license or permit, if such license or permit is not obtained or reinstated within thirty (30) days, unless such loss, suspension, revocation or failure to renew could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us; or there is filed against us or any of our subsidiaries or any of our officers, members or managers any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding under any federal or state racketeering statute (including, without limitation, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act of 1970), or any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding under any other applicable law is filed by any governmental entity, that could result in the confiscation or forfeiture of any material portion of any collateral subject to any security interest held by the investors or their agent or other assets of such entity or person, and such action, suit or proceeding is not dismissed within one hundred twenty (120) days.\nUpon an event of default under the notes, the holder of such note may declare the entire unpaid balance (as well as any interest, fees and expenses) immediately due and payable. Funding to repay such notes may not be available timely, on favorable terms, if at all, and any default by us of the terms and conditions of the notes would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nWe owe certain obligations to MIEJ under the New MIEJ Note, which is secured by a subordinated security interest in substantially all of our assets and is convertible into shares of our common stock subject to the terms of such New MIEJ Note, and may result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders.\nThe New MIEJ Note is subordinated in every way to the senior credit facility as well as to New Senior Lending (defined below); however, MIEJ has no control over our cash flow, nor is MIEJ\u2019s consent required in connection with any disposition, sale, or use of any of our assets, provided that the requirements of the New MIEJ Note requiring the prepayment of interest, where applicable, as described below are followed. We have the right under the New MIEJ Note to enter into a loan, or a series of new loans or any other new non-equity investment or assumption of indebtedness (a \u201cNew Senior Lending\u201d) which will be senior to the New MIEJ Note, without the prior consent of MIEJ, provided that, in addition to the approximately $35.5 million principal balance of the original PEDEVCO Senior Loan created in March 2014, the New Senior Lending is subject to a cap of an additional $60 million in the aggregate, such that the total lending, debt or similar investment under such cap shall not exceed $95 million in the aggregate (the \u201cSenior Debt Cap\u201d), with any portion of New Senior Lending in excess of the Senior Debt Cap advanced first to MIEJ until the New MIEJ Note is paid in full. The New MIEJ Note shall automatically, and without further consent from MIEJ, be subordinated in every way to any such New Senior Lending. Should we enter into any new financing transaction that results in raising New Senior Lending of at least $20 million in excess of the balance of the PEDEVCO Senior Loan, then MIEJ has a right to be paid all interest and fees that have accrued on the New MIEJ Note each and every time that a new financing transaction reaches or exceeds the $20 million threshold.\nThe New MIEJ Note was originally due and payable on March 8, 2017, but is now due and payable on March 8, 2019, due to an automatic maturity date extension as a result of the May 2016 Senior Debt Restructuring, and with such date also subject to additional automatic extensions upon the occurrence of a Long-Term Financing or additional PEDEVCO Senior Lending Restructuring (each as defined below) (the \u201cMaturity\u201d). On a one-time basis, the PEDEVCO Senior Loan may be refinanced by a new loan (\u201cLong-Term Financing\u201d) by one or more third party replacement lenders (\u201cReplacement Lenders\u201d), and in such event we are required to undertake commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Replacement Lenders to simultaneously refinance both the PEDEVCO Senior Loan and the New MIEJ Note as part of such Long-Term Financing. Despite such efforts, should the Replacement Lenders be unable or unwilling to include the New MIEJ Note in such financing, then the Long-Term Financing may proceed without including the New MIEJ Note, and the New MIEJ Note shall remain in place and shall be automatically subordinated, without further consent of MIEJ, to such Long-Term Financing. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Long-Term Financing, the Maturity of the New MIEJ Note is automatically extended, without further consent of MIEJ, to the same maturity date of the Long-Term Financing (the \u201cExtended Maturity Date\u201d), provided that the Extended Maturity Date may not exceed March 8, 2020. Additionally, upon the closing of such Long-Term Financing: (a) the Long-Term Financing is required to be subject to the Senior Debt Cap, (b) we are required to make commercially reasonable best efforts for the Long-Term Financing to include adequate reserves or other payment provisions whereby MIEJ is paid all interest and fees accrued on the New MIEJ Note commencing as of March 8, 2017 (and annually thereafter, until such time as the New MIEJ Note is paid in full), but in any event the Replacement Lenders are required to agree to allow for quarterly interest payments (starting March 31, 2017) of not less than 5% per annum on the outstanding balance of the New MIEJ Note, plus a one-time payment of accrued interest (not to exceed $500,000) as of March 31, 2017 (the \u201cSubordinated Interest Payments\u201d), and the remaining 5% interest shall continue to accrue, and (c) MIEJ has the Right of Conversion (defined below) commencing as of March 8, 2017, the original maturity date of the New MIEJ Note. If the PEDEVCO Senior Loan and/or New Senior Lending is not refinanced by Replacement Lenders, but is instead refinanced, restructured or extended by the existing Investors (a \u201cPEDEVCO Senior Lending Restructuring\u201d), the maturity of both the New MIEJ Note and the PEDEVCO Senior Loan may be extended to no later than March 8, 2019, without requiring the consent of MIEJ, provided that (i) any such extension of the maturity date of the New MIEJ Note past March 8, 2017 shall give MIEJ the Right of Conversion (described below) commencing on March 8, 2017, and (ii) such extension agreement shall include payment provisions whereby MIEJ shall be paid all interest and fees accrued on the New MIEJ Note as of March 8, 2018. The May 2016 Senior Debt Restructuring qualified as a PEDEVCO Senior Lending Restructuring and the issuance of the Tranche A Notes qualified as a New Senior Lending, the result of which the Maturity of the New MIEJ Note has been extended to March 8, 2019. The New MIEJ Note may be prepaid any time without penalty.\nThe New MIEJ Note has a conversion feature that provides that beginning March 8, 2017, MIEJ has the right, at its discretion, to have the outstanding balance of the New MIEJ Note plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon converted in whole or in part into our common stock at a price (the \u201cConversion Price\u201d) equal to 80% of the average closing price per share of our common stock over the then previous 60 days from the date MIEJ exercises its conversion right (subject to adjustment for stock splits, recapitalizations and the like)(such event, a \u201cRight of Conversion\u201d); provided, however, that in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than $0.30 per share (the \u201cFloor Price\u201d). The New MIEJ Note originally included a conversion limitation subject to us receiving shareholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules, but at the 2016 Annual Meeting held on December 28, 2016, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the full conversion of the New MIEJ Note and the New MIEJ Note is now fully convertible into our common stock in accordance with its terms.\nIf an event of default occurs under the New MIEJ Note, MIEJ may enforce their security interests over our assets (subject to the subordination rights in such note) which secure the repayment of such obligations, and we could be forced to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in us could become worthless.\nThe required interest and principal payments due under the New MIEJ Note may make it harder for us to refinance the New MIEJ Note or raise funding in the future, or could materially decrease the amount of cash we receive for our operations upon any refinancing or funding.\nThe issuance of common stock pursuant to the terms of the New MIEJ Note could result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nA substantial part of our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production is located in the D-J Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing formations.\nOur operations are focused primarily in the D-J Basin of Weld County, Colorado, which means our current producing properties and new drilling opportunities are geographically concentrated in that area. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including:\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the wells in the area;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters such as the flooding that occurred in the area in September 2013;\n\u25cf\nrestrictive governmental regulations; and\n\u25cf\ncurtailment of production or interruption in the availability of gathering, processing or transportation infrastructure and services, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells.\nFor example, bottlenecks in processing and transportation that have occurred in some recent periods in the D-J Basin have negatively affected our results of operations, and these adverse effects may be disproportionately severe to us compared to our more geographically diverse competitors. Similarly, the concentration of our assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules that could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in areas where exploration and production activities are increasing, as has been the case in recent years in the D-J Basin, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services increase. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital forecast, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk, with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. We have not recorded significant proved reserves, and areas that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercial quantities or at all.\nExploring for and developing hydrocarbon reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes us from definitively predicting the costs involved and time required to reach certain objectives. Our potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation before they can be drilled. The budgeted costs of planning, drilling, completing and operating wells are often exceeded and such costs can increase significantly due to various complications that may arise during the drilling and operating processes. Before a well is spud, we may incur significant geological and geophysical (seismic) costs, which are incurred whether a well eventually produces commercial quantities of hydrocarbons or is drilled at all. Exploration wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. The analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling locations. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed and could be forced to modify our drilling plans accordingly.\nIf we decide to drill a certain location, there is a risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found or produced. We may drill or participate in new wells that are not productive. We may drill wells that are productive, but that do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover exploration, drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon-bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production and reserves from the well or abandonment of the well. Whether a well is ultimately productive and profitable depends on a number of additional factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and industry conditions, including the prices received for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nshortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment, including hydraulic fracturing equipment, and qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\npotential drainage by operators on adjacent properties;\n\u25cf\nloss of or damage to oilfield development and service tools;\n\u25cf\nproblems with title to the underlying properties;\n\u25cf\nincreases in severance taxes;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions that delay drilling activities or cause producing wells to be shut down;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations; and\n\u25cf\nproximity to and capacity of transportation facilities.\nIf we do not drill productive and profitable wells in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent on the prices of oil and natural gas. Low oil or natural gas prices and the substantial volatility in these prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations.\nThe prices we receive for our oil and natural gas heavily influence our revenue, profitability, cash flow available for capital expenditures, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile. For example, the price of oil has fallen dramatically since mid-2014, with a high over $100 per barrel in June 2014 to lows below $30 per barrel in early 2016, in each case based on WTI prices, due to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply, global economic concerns, the likely resumption of oil exports from Iran and OPEC\u2019s decision not to reduce supply. Prices for natural gas and NGLs have experienced declines of similar magnitude. An extended period of continued lower oil prices, or additional price declines, will have further adverse effects on us. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe domestic and foreign demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe prices and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u25cf\nspeculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u25cf\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals, including the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and transportation systems for natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of refining capacity;\n\u25cf\nthe prices and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in or affecting oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East and South America;\n\u25cf\nthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military action and civil unrest;\n\u25cf\npublic pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u25cf\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories and exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf\nauthorization of exports from the Unites States of liquefied natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u25cf\noverall worldwide economic conditions.\nDeclines in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce our revenue, but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Should natural gas or oil prices decrease from current levels and remain there for an extended period of time, we may elect in the future to delay some of our exploration and development plans for our prospects, or to cease exploration or development activities on certain prospects due to the anticipated unfavorable economics from such activities, and, as a result, we may have to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture conditions might require us to make write-downs in our assets, which would adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nWe review our long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We also test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on December 31 of each year, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. If conditions in any of the businesses in which we compete were to deteriorate, we could determine that certain of our assets were impaired and we would then be required to write-off all or a portion of our costs for such assets. Any such significant write-offs would adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors indicated in their report on the Company\u2019s consolidated audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 that conditions existed that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due in part to the current crude oil price environment and the fact that the Company had a working capital deficit and accumulated deficit at December 31, 2016. Uncertainties related to our continuation as a going concern may impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives and/or negatively affect our relationships with partners and service providers. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon the availability and terms of future funding, our ability to grow our operations and integrate newly acquired assets and operations, our ability to acquire additional assets and operations, and our ability to improve operating margins and regain profitability. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and the Company may not be able to continue. If we ceased operations, it is likely that all of our investors would lose their investment.\nThe Company will seek financing from other sources. Such financings may not be available or, if available, may not be on terms acceptable to the Company. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital to meet its obligations and attain profitable operations.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and natural gas, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad continues to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms, which could adversely affect our future growth.\nOur exploration and development activities are capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Our cash on hand, our operating cash flows and future potential borrowings may not be adequate to fund our future acquisitions or future capital expenditure requirements. The rate of our future growth may be dependent, at least in part, on our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be acceptable.\nOur cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u25cf\nour estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells;\n\u25cf\nthe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u25cf\nthe ability and willingness of banks to lend to us; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nIn addition, future events, such as terrorist attacks, wars or combat peace-keeping missions, financial market disruptions, general economic recessions, oil and natural gas industry recessions, large company bankruptcies, accounting scandals, overstated reserves estimates by major public oil companies and disruptions in the financial and capital markets have caused financial institutions, credit rating agencies and the public to more closely review the financial statements, capital structures and earnings of public companies, including energy companies. Such events have constrained the capital available to the energy industry in the past, and such events or similar events could adversely affect our access to funding for our operations in the future.\nIf our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels, further develop and exploit our current properties or invest in additional exploration opportunities. Alternatively, a significant improvement in oil and natural gas prices or other factors could result in an increase in our capital expenditures and we may be required to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, the sale or farm out of interests in our assets, the borrowing of funds or otherwise to meet any increase in capital needs. If we are unable to raise additional capital from available sources at acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, future debt financings may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities. If we succeed in selling additional equity securities to raise funds, at such time the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we choose to farm-out interests in our prospects, we may lose operating control over such prospects.\nOur oil and natural gas reserves are estimated and may not reflect the actual volumes of oil and natural gas we will receive, and significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas is complex and is not exact, due to numerous inherent uncertainties. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions related to, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserves estimate is a function of:\n\u25cf\nthe quality and quantity of available data;\n\u25cf\nthe interpretation of that data;\n\u25cf\nthe judgment of the persons preparing the estimate; and\n\u25cf\nthe accuracy of the assumptions.\nThe accuracy of any estimates of proved reserves generally increases with the length of the production history. Due to the limited production history of our properties, the estimates of future production associated with these properties may be subject to greater variance to actual production than would be the case with properties having a longer production history. As our wells produce over time and more data is available, the estimated proved reserves will be re-determined on at least an annual basis and may be adjusted to reflect new information based upon our actual production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas most likely will vary from our estimates. It is possible that future production declines in our wells may be greater than we have estimated. Any significant variance to our estimates could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nWe may record impairments of oil and gas properties that would reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting is used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties are capitalized. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset\u2019s carrying value and estimated fair value. This impairment does not impact cash flows from operating activities but does reduce earnings and our shareholders\u2019 equity. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil and gas properties increases during periods of low oil or gas prices. As a result, there is an increased risk that we will incur an impairment in 2017. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil and gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period. We have in the past and could in the future incur additional impairments of oil and gas properties.\nWe may have accidents, equipment failures or mechanical problems while drilling or completing wells or in production activities, which could adversely affect our business.\nWhile we are drilling and completing wells or involved in production activities, we may have accidents or experience equipment failures or mechanical problems in a well that cause us to be unable to drill and complete the well or to continue to produce the well according to our plans. We may also damage a potentially hydrocarbon-bearing formation during drilling and completion operations. Such incidents may result in a reduction of our production and reserves from the well or in abandonment of the well.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nThere are numerous operational hazards inherent in oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and gathering, including:\n\u25cf\nunusual or unexpected geologic formations;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated pressures;\n\u25cf\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u25cf\nblowouts where oil or natural gas flows uncontrolled at a wellhead;\n\u25cf\ncratering or collapse of the formation;\n\u25cf\npipe or cement leaks, failures or casing collapses;\n\u25cf\nfires or explosions;\n\u25cf\nreleases of hazardous substances or other waste materials that cause environmental damage;\n\u25cf\npressures or irregularities in formations; and\n\u25cf\nequipment failures or accidents.\nIn addition, there is an inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, some of which may be material, due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, our emissions to air and water, the underground injection or other disposal of our wastes, the use of hydraulic fracturing fluids and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices.\nAny of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption or impairment of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and substantial revenue losses. The location of our wells, gathering systems, pipelines and other facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. We maintain $2 million general liability coverage and $10 million umbrella coverage that covers our and our subsidiaries\u2019 business and operations. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Hawk, which operates our D-J Basin Asset, also maintains a $10 million control of well insurance policy that covers its operations in Colorado. With respect to our other non-operated assets, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could, therefore, occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Moreover, insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms. Changes in the insurance markets due to various factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of coverage in the future. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not cover certain hazards or all potential losses that are currently covered, and may be subject to large deductibles. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe threat and impact of terrorist attacks, cyber attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our operations.\nWe cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general, and on us in particular, either in the short-term or in the long-term. Uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines and gathering systems, production facilities, processing plants and refineries, could be targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, a cyber attack or electronic security breach, or an act of war.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information, or damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur strategy as an onshore unconventional resource player may result in operations concentrated in certain geographic areas and may increase our exposure to many of the risks described in this Annual Report.\nOur current operations are concentrated in the state of Colorado. This concentration may increase the potential impact of many of the risks described in this Annual Report. For example, we may have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting Colorado, natural disasters in Colorado, competition for equipment, services and materials available in Colorado and access to infrastructure and markets in Colorado.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on properties owned by us or by other persons or entities and (b) economically finding or acquiring additional oil and natural gas producing properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties. During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur strategy includes acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, and our failure to identify or complete future acquisitions successfully, including our planned combination with GOM, or not produce projected revenues associated with the future acquisitions could reduce our earnings and hamper our growth.\nWe may be unable to identify properties for acquisition or to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable. There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. The completion and pursuit of acquisitions may be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will require us to continue to invest in operations, financial and management information systems and to attract, retain, motivate and effectively manage our employees. The inability to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, and could negatively impact our results of operations and growth potential. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the completion of significant acquisitions during particular periods. If we are not successful in identifying or acquiring any material property interests, our earnings could be reduced and our growth could be restricted.\nWe may engage in bidding and negotiating to complete successful acquisitions. We may be required to alter or increase substantially our capitalization to finance these acquisitions through the use of cash on hand, the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, the sale of non-strategic assets, the borrowing of funds or otherwise. If we were to proceed with one or more acquisitions involving the issuance of our common stock, our shareholders would suffer dilution of their interests. Furthermore, our decision to acquire properties that are substantially different in operating or geologic characteristics or geographic locations from areas with which our staff is familiar may impact our productivity in such areas.\nWe may not be able to produce the projected revenues related to future acquisitions. There are many assumptions related to the projection of the revenues of future acquisitions including, but not limited to, drilling success, oil and natural gas prices, production decline curves and other data. If revenues from future acquisitions do not meet projections, this could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFailure to complete the GOM Merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the GOM Merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe will not realize the benefits expected from the GOM Merger, including a potentially enhanced competitive and financial position, expansion of assets and therefore opportunities, and will instead be subject to all the risks we currently face as an independent company;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our partners and employees;\n\u25cf\nthe GOM Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the GOM Merger or the termination of the GOM Merger Agreement. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of GOM, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the GOM Merger; and\n\u25cf\nmatters relating to the GOM Merger (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nThe GOM Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the GOM Merger may not be completed.\nThe GOM Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the GOM Merger. Those conditions include (1) approval of the GOM Merger Agreement by the board of directors of the Company, the sole Manager and member of Merger Sub, the Board of Managers of GOM, and the members of GOM, (2) receipt of required regulatory approvals, (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the GOM Merger, and (4) approval of the NYSE MKT for the issuance of the common stock and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred to the members of GOM at closing. In addition, prior to the closing of the GOM Merger, either the Company or GOM may terminate the GOM Merger at any time.\nTermination of the GOM Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company.\nIn the event the GOM Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may have been adversely impacted by our failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the GOM Merger, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the GOM Merger will be completed. If the GOM Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another transaction or business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration provided for by the GOM Merger.\nThe closing of the GOM merger is subject to various risks and closing conditions and such planned transaction may not occur on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe GOM Merger is subject to various closing conditions as set forth in greater detail in the GOM Merger Agreement. Additionally, the Company is aware that the parent company of GOM has experienced significant liquidity problems, is currently under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, is currently under the control of a court-appointed liquidator that is taking steps to liquidate its assets, including the assets subject to the GOM Merger, has filed for Bankruptcy protection, and certain of its assets are also subject to separate Bankruptcy proceedings initiated by certain creditors. In addition, to the extent GOM\u2019s assets are encumbered by debt, and such debtholders do not agree to the assumption of the debt by the Company, or to otherwise refinance or restructure such debt as needed to consummate the GOM Merger, GOM and the Company may not be able to consummate the GOM Merger. Any one of these circumstances may delay the closing of the GOM Merger or prevent certain closing conditions associated therewith from occurring, which in turn could prevent the merger from closing.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the GOM Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the GOM Merger on employees and partners may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the GOM Merger is completed, and could cause partners and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or cause potential new partners to delay doing business with us until the GOM Merger has been successfully completed. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the GOM Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or compensation structure. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business following the GOM Merger could be negatively impacted. In addition, the GOM Merger Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the GOM Merger is completed without the consent of GOM. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the GOM Merger.\nWe may purchase oil and natural gas properties with liabilities or risks that we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, and, as a result, we could be subject to liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBefore acquiring oil and natural gas properties, we estimate the reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental liabilities and other factors relating to the properties. However, our review involves many assumptions and estimates, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. As a result, we may not discover all existing or potential problems associated with the properties we buy. We may not become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not generally perform inspections on every well or property, and we may not be able to observe mechanical and environmental problems even when we conduct an inspection. The seller may not be willing or financially able to give us contractual protection against any identified problems, and we may decide to assume environmental and other liabilities in connection with properties we acquire. If we acquire properties with risks or liabilities we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as we settle claims and incur cleanup costs related to these liabilities.\nWe may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest.\nIf an examination of the title history of a property that we have purchased reveals an oil and natural gas lease has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the property, our interest would be worthless. In such an instance, the amount paid for such oil and natural gas lease as well as any royalties paid pursuant to the terms of the lease prior to the discovery of the title defect would be lost.\nPrior to the drilling of an oil and natural gas well, it is the normal practice in the oil and natural gas industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit within which the proposed oil and natural gas well is to be drilled to ensure there are no obvious deficiencies in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. In the future, we may suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, unproved and unevaluated acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management team has identified and scheduled drilling locations in our operating areas over a multi-year period. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of equipment and capital, approval by regulators, seasonal conditions, oil and natural gas prices, assessment of risks, costs and drilling results. The final determination on whether to drill any of these locations will be dependent upon the factors described elsewhere in this filing and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as well as, to some degree, the results of our drilling activities with respect to our established drilling locations. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected timeframe or at all or if we will be able to economically produce hydrocarbons from these or any other potential drilling locations. Our actual drilling activities may be materially different from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently license only a limited amount of seismic and other geological data and may have difficulty obtaining additional data at a reasonable cost, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe currently license only a limited amount of seismic and other geological data to assist us in exploration and development activities. We intend to obtain access to additional data in our areas of interest through licensing arrangements with companies that own or have access to that data or by paying to obtain that data directly. Seismic and geological data can be expensive to license or obtain. We may not be able to license or obtain such data at an acceptable cost. In addition, even when properly interpreted, seismic data and visualization techniques are not conclusive in determining if hydrocarbons are present in economically producible amounts and seismic indications of hydrocarbon saturation are generally not reliable indicators of productive reservoir rock.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies and personnel, including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel, could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our operations. When drilling activity in the United States increases, associated costs typically also increase, including those costs related to drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. These costs may increase, and necessary equipment and services may become unavailable to us at economical prices. Should this increase in costs occur, we may delay drilling activities, which may limit our ability to establish and replace reserves, or we may incur these higher costs, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the demand for hydraulic fracturing services currently exceeds the availability of fracturing equipment and crews across the industry and in our operating areas in particular. The accelerated wear and tear of hydraulic fracturing equipment due to its deployment in unconventional oil and natural gas fields characterized by longer lateral lengths and larger numbers of fracturing stages has further amplified this equipment and crew shortage. If demand for fracturing services increases or the supply of fracturing equipment and crews decreases, then higher costs could result and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate.\nWe are not the operator on some of our properties and, as a result, our ability to exercise influence over the operations of these properties or their associated costs is limited. Our dependence on the operators and other working interest owners of these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs or control the risks could materially and adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u25cf\nthe rate of production of reserves, if any;\n\u25cf\napproval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u25cf\nselection of technology.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon oil and natural gas gathering and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties, and the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nThe unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production from our wells. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for, and supply of, oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut-in wells for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system capacity. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until production arrangements were made to deliver our production to market. Furthermore, if we were required to shut-in wells we might also be obligated to pay shut-in royalties to certain mineral interest owners in order to maintain our leases. We do not expect to purchase firm transportation capacity on third-party facilities. Therefore, we expect the transportation of our production to be generally interruptible in nature and lower in priority to those having firm transportation arrangements.\nThe disruption of third-party facilities due to maintenance and/or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. The third parties control when or if such facilities are restored and what prices will be charged. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas.\nStrategic relationships, including with Tenet Advisory Group, upon which we may rely, are subject to risks and uncertainties which may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur ability to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas resources successfully and acquire oil and natural gas interests and acreage depends on our developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants and on our ability to select and evaluate suitable acquisition opportunities in a highly competitive environment. These realities are subject to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo develop our business, we will endeavor to use the business relationships of our management and board to enter into strategic relationships, which may take the form of contractual arrangements with other oil and natural gas companies, including those that supply equipment and other resources that we expect to use in our business. For example, we have retained Tenet Advisory Group, LLC as a key advisor for our operations, exploration and drilling efforts. We may not be able to establish these strategic relationships, or if established, we may not be able to maintain them. In addition, the dynamics of our relationships with strategic partners may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to incur in order to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain our relationships. If our strategic relationships are not established or maintained, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe prices that we will receive for our oil and natural gas production sometimes may reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the prices we receive is called a differential. Increases in the differential between the benchmark prices for oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have, and may not have in the future, any derivative contracts covering the amount of the basis differentials we experience in respect of our production. As such, we will be exposed to any increase in such differentials.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plans, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities, including our planned increase in oil exploration, development and production, and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the inability to recruit and retain experienced managers, geoscientists, petroleum engineers and landmen could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nFinancial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers, third-party operators or other third parties could decrease our cash flow from operations and adversely affect the exploration and development of our prospects and assets.\nWe will derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our oil and natural gas to unaffiliated third-party purchasers, independent marketing companies and mid-stream companies. Any delays in payments from our purchasers caused by financial problems encountered by them will have an immediate negative effect on our results of operations.\nLiquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our working interest co-owners or the third-party operators of our non-operated properties may prevent or delay the drilling of a well or the development of a project. Our working interest co-owners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the case of a farmout party, we would have to find a new farmout party or obtain alternative funding in order to complete the exploration and development of the prospects subject to a farmout agreement. In the case of a working interest owner, we could be required to pay the working interest owner\u2019s share of the project costs. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the capital necessary to fund either of these contingencies or that we would be able to find a new farmout party.\nThe calculated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows as included in our public filings is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on current costs held constant over time without escalation and on commodity prices using an unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month index prices, appropriately adjusted, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used for these estimates and will be affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nactual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our unit costs.\nIn the future, we may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf\na significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u25cf\na high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nany covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf\na high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u25cf\ndebt covenants to which we may agree may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, and many of our competitors have more established presences in the United States than we have. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased in recent years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices, we may be subject to significant reductions in prices. Alternatively, we may use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts, which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our profitability.\nIn the event that we choose not to hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices by purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies, we may be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability. Alternatively, we may elect to use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment governing the oil and natural gas industry, particularly changes in the current Colorado forced pooling system, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to various forms of government regulation, including laws and regulations concerning the location, spacing and permitting of the oil and natural gas wells we drill, among other matters. In particular, our business utilizes a methodology available in Colorado known as \u201cforced pooling,\u201d which refers to the ability of a holder of an oil and natural gas interest in a particular prospective drilling spacing unit to apply to the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (the \u201cCOGCC\u201d) for an order forcing all other holders of oil and natural gas interests in such area into a common pool for purposes of developing that drilling spacing unit. This methodology is especially important for our operations in the Greeley area, where there are many interest holders. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment governing our industry, particularly any changes to Colorado forced pooling procedures that make forced pooling more difficult to accomplish, could result in increased compliance costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves (\u201cPUDs\u201d) in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill or plan on delaying those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nWe are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental and occupational health and safety issues that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling and other regulated activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations or specific projects and limit our growth and revenue.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances and wastes, as a result of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and because of historical operations and waste disposal practices at our leased and owned properties. Spills or other releases of regulated substances, including such spills and releases that occur in the future, could expose us to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Under certain of such laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and even if our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, air emissions control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, on October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) for ground-level ozone from the current standard of 75 parts per billion (\u201cppb\u201d) for the current 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 ppb for both standards. States are expected to implement more stringent requirements as a result of this new final rule, which could apply to our operations. Compliance with this more stringent standard and other environmental regulations could delay or prohibit our ability to obtain permits for operations or require us to install additional pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Please read \u201cPart I\u201d - \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d - \u201cRegulation of the Oil and Gas Industry\u201d and \u201cRegulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters\u201d for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable regulatory agency administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (\u201cEPAct 2005\u201d), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the \u201cFERC\u201d) has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (\u201cNGA\u201d) to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation. The FERC may also impose administrative and criminal remedies and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Additional rules and regulations pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) has regulations intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry with authority to fine violators of the regulations civil penalties of up to $1 million per day and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) prohibits market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC, including similar anti-manipulation authority with respect to oil swaps and futures contracts as that granted to the CFTC with respect to oil purchases and sales. The CFTC rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, as described in \u201cPart I\u201d - \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d - \u201cRegulation of the Oil and Gas Industry\u201d.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and NGL that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that typically will be established by state agencies. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources, which include certain of our operations.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In addition, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France (\u201cParis Agreement\u201d) that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how new laws or regulations in the United States or any legal requirements imposed following the United States\u2019 agreeing to the Paris Agreement that may be adopted or issued to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws, regulations or legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations as well as delays or restrictions in our ability to permit GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nHydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has published final Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) regulations in 2012 and, more recently, in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing, leak detection, and permitting; published on June 28, 2016 an effluent limited guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule in March 2015, establishing stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, including well casing and wastewater storage requirements and an obligation for exploration and production operators to disclose what chemicals they are using in fracturing activities; however, on June 21, 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked congressional authority to promulgate the rule. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that a new, federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process is adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.\nCertain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources. Other governmental agencies, including the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nAt the state level, Colorado, where we conduct operations, is among the states that has adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, several cities in Colorado passed temporary or permanent moratoria on hydraulic fracturing within their respective cities\u2019 limits in 2012-2013 but, since that time, in response to lawsuits brought by an industry trade group, the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, local district courts struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities in 2014, primarily on the basis that state law preempts local bans on hydraulic fracturing. The cities of Fort Collins and Longmont, among those cities whose ordinances were struck down in 2014, appealed their decisions to the Colorado Supreme Court, but on May 2, 2016, the state supreme court upheld the lower court rulings in those two cases, holding that a five-year moratorium on hydraulic fracturing adopted by Fort Collins and a ban on fracturing adopted by Longmont were pre-empted by state law and, therefore, unenforceable. Another suit brought by the Colorado trade group against one other city, Broomfield, who had adopted a moratorium on fracturing, has been on hold pending the outcome of the Colorado Supreme Court ruling in the Fort Collins and Longmont cases. Notwithstanding attempts at the local level to prohibit hydraulic fracturing, there exists the opportunity for cities to adopt local ordinances allowing hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions but regulating the time, place and manner of those activities.\nIn addition, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various options for ballot initiatives aimed at significantly limiting or preventing oil and natural gas development. In response to such initiatives, the Governor of Colorado created a Task Force on State and Local Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations (\u201cTask Force\u201d) in September 2014 to make recommendations to the state legislature regarding the responsible development of Colorado\u2019s oil and gas resources. In February 2015, the Task Force made nine non-binding recommendations to the Governor that will require legislative or regulatory action to be implemented. Among other things, the recommendations received from the Task Force would require pursuit of state rulemaking targeting increased collaborative efforts between oil and natural gas operators and local governments regarding large-scale oil and natural gas facilities in defined \u201curban mitigation areas\u201d; operator registration with local government designees and possible advance notice of future oil and natural gas drilling and production facility locations that would be integrated into the local comprehensive planning process; development of enhanced local governmental designee roles and functions to more effectively serve as liaisons between industry, residents and local officials; increased staffing levels at the state environmental and oil and natural gas agencies; establishing an oil and natural gas information clearinghouse; establishing a working group to investigate ways to reduce oil and natural gas vehicular traffic on roadways; pursuit of state air emissions rules including methane emissions capture rules; and establishing a compliance assistance program to assist oil and natural gas operators in complying with applicable rules. On January 25, 2016, two of the recommendations, regarding the collaboration of local governments, the COGCC and oil and natural gas operators in the siting of large scale oil and natural gas facilities in defined urban mitigation areas and long-term planning for including future oil and natural gas development in local comprehensive planning processes, were approved by the COGCC as new rules. It is possible that the COGCC could elect to pursue one or more of the remaining Task Force recommendations or the Colorado state legislature could seek to adopt new policies or legislation relating to oil and natural gas operations, including measures that would give local governments in Colorado greater authority to limit hydraulic fracturing and other oil and natural gas operations or require greater distances between well sites and occupied structures. In addition, it is possible that notwithstanding the recommendations made by the Task Force, certain interest groups in Colorado or even members of the Colorado state legislature may seek to pursue ballot initiatives in the future and/or legislation that may or may not coincide with the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, including, among other things, pursuit of initiatives or legislation for changes in state law that would allow local governments to ban hydraulic fracturing in Colorado.\nIn the event that ballot initiatives or local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, including the Wattenberg Field in Colorado, that impose more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Any such increased costs, delays, cessations, restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nPlease read \u201cPart I\u201d - \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d - \u201cRegulation of the Oil and Gas Industry\u201d and \u201cRegulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters\u201d for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nBallot initiatives that would impose more stringent restrictions for new oil and natural gas wells and related facilities may serve to limit future oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and business.\nProponents of legal requirements imposing more stringent restrictions on oil and gas exploration and production activities in Colorado sought to include on the November 2016 ballot certain ballot initiatives that, if approved, would have allowed revisions to the state constitution in a manner that would have made such exploration and production activities in the state more difficult in the future. Among the ballot initiatives pursued in 2016 were ballot initiative Number 75 (\u201cInitiative 75\u201d), which sought to authorize local governmental to control oil and natural gas development in Colorado that could have resulted in the imposition of more stringent requirements than currently implemented under state law, and ballot initiative Number 78 (\u201cInitiative 78\u201d), which proposed a much more stringent 2,500-foot mandatory setback between an oil and natural gas development facility (including oil and natural gas wells, production and processing equipment and pits) and specified occupied structures and areas of special concern. Changes sought under these ballot initiatives would have applied to new oil and gas development facilities in Colorado. Proponents of these measures collected signatures for placing Initiatives 75 and 78 on the November 2016 ballot and submitted those signatures to the Colorado Secretary of State by the August 8, 2016 deadline. However, on August 29, 2016, the Secretary of State announced that the proponents had failed to gather enough valid signatures to put Initiatives 75 and 78 on the November 2016 ballot. Notwithstanding the Colorado Secretary of State\u2019s announcement on August 29, 2016, in the event that ballot initiatives or local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in the future in areas where we conduct operations that impose more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.\nRecently announced rules regulating methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations could cause us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs or delays in production of oil and natural gas, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn June 3, 2016, the EPA published final rules establishing new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions in the oil and natural gas source category by up to 45% from 2012 levels by the year 2025. The EPA\u2019s final rules include New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) to limit methane emissions from equipment and processes across the oil and natural gas source category. The rules also extend limitations on volatile organic compound (\u201cVOC\u201d) emissions to sources that were unregulated under the previous NSPS at Subpart OOOO. Affected methane and VOC sources include hydraulically fractured (or re-fractured) oil and natural gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and pneumatic pumps. The new methane and VOC standards require the implementation of the best system of emission reduction to achieve these emission reductions, mirroring the existing VOC standards under Subpart OOOO. These rules could require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control methane and VOC emissions from certain hydraulic fracturing wells, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact or delay oil and natural gas production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations or materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nAs a result of future legislation, certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated and our production may be subject to the imposition of new U.S. federal taxes.\nThe U.S. President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Proposal and legislation introduced in a prior session of Congress includes proposals that, if enacted into law, would eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies or potentially make our operations subject to the imposition of new U.S. federal taxes. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and (v) imposition of a $10.25 per barrel fee on oil, to be paid by oil companies (but the budget does not describe where and how such a fee would be collected). It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change, as well as any changes to or the imposition of new U.S. federal, state or local taxes (including the imposition of, or increase in production, severance or similar taxes), could increase the cost of exploration and development of oil and gas resources, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. As a result, we may incur material write-downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nOur operations in the D-J Basin in Weld County, Colorado, involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques in order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks that we may face while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we may face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations will be more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. In the highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nOur leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a primary term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. The loss of substantial leases could have a material adverse effect on our assets, operations, revenues and cash flow and could cause the value of our securities to decline in value.\nCompetition for hydraulic fracturing services and water disposal could impede our ability to develop our shale plays.\nThe unavailability or high cost of high pressure pumping services (or hydraulic fracturing services), chemicals, proppant, water and water disposal and related services and equipment could limit our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. The oil and natural gas industry is experiencing a growing emphasis on the exploitation and development of shale natural gas and shale oil resource plays, which are dependent on hydraulic fracturing for economically successful development. Hydraulic fracturing in shale plays requires high pressure pumping service crews. A shortage of service crews or proppant, chemical, water or water disposal options, especially if this shortage occurred in eastern Colorado, could materially and adversely affect our operations and the timeliness of executing our development plans within our budget.\nThe derivatives legislation adopted by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, sets forth the new framework for regulating certain derivative products including the commodity hedges of the type that we may elect to use, but many aspects of this law are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our ability or willingness to enter into and maintain such commodity hedges and the terms of such hedges. There is a possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act could have a substantial and adverse impact on our ability to enter into and maintain these commodity hedges. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act could result in the implementation of position limits and additional regulatory requirements on derivative arrangements, which could include new margin, reporting and clearing requirements. In addition, this legislation could have a substantial impact on our counterparties and may increase the cost of our derivative arrangements in the future.\nIf these types of commodity hedges become unavailable or uneconomic, our commodity price risk could increase, which would increase the volatility of revenues and may decrease the amount of credit available to us. Any limitations or changes in our use of derivative arrangements could also materially affect our future ability to conduct acquisitions.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking processes. Our operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). Colorado and other western states have recently experienced a drought. As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may be limited. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and conditions could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands. Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters has, and will continue to, complicate and increase the cost of obtaining such permits or other approvals. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations, and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General permits issued by the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. In October 2011, the EPA announced its intention to develop federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. If adopted, the pretreatment rules will require coalbed methane and shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities Some states have banned the treatment of fracturing wastewater at publicly owned treatment facilities. There has been recent nationwide concern over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. It is likely that new rules and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others. Finally, the EPA study noted above has focused and will continue to focus on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It is possible that, following the conclusion of the EPA\u2019s study, the agency will move to more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our business, financial condition, and operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal or recycling of water will increase our operating costs and may cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In addition, our inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion operations may impact our business, and any such future laws and regulations could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nAs a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The law prohibits the harming of endangered or threatened species, provides for habitat protection, and imposes stringent penalties for noncompliance. The final designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nPotential conflicts of interest could arise for certain members of our management team that hold management positions with other entities.\nMichael L. Peterson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Clark R. Moore, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, hold various other management positions with privately-held companies not involved in the oil and gas industry. We believe these positions require only an immaterial amount of each officers\u2019 time and will not conflict with their roles or responsibilities with our company. If any of these companies enter into one or more transactions with our company, or if the officers\u2019 position with any such company requires significantly more time than currently anticipated, potential conflicts of interests could arise from the officers performing services for us and these other entities.\nDownturns and volatility in global economies and commodity and credit markets could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by the conditions of the global economies and the credit, commodities and stock markets. Among other things, we may be adversely impacted if consumers of oil and gas are not able to access sufficient capital to continue to operate their businesses or to operate them at prior levels. A decline in consumer confidence or changing patterns in the availability and use of disposable income by consumers can negatively affect the demand for oil and gas and as a result our results of operations.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our operations depend on the demand for oil and used oil, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies (such as wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells and biofuels) that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil, gas and oil and gas related products could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition due to advances in renewable fuels may lessen the demand for our products and negatively impact our profitability.\nAlternatives to petroleum-based products and production methods are continually under development. For example, a number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells or clean-burning gaseous fuels that may address increasing worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns, which if successful could lower the demand for oil and gas. If these non-petroleum based products and oil alternatives continue to expand and gain broad acceptance such that the overall demand for oil and gas is decreased it could have an adverse effect on our operations and the value of our assets.\nCurrently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and may be involved in governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may be subject in the normal course of business to judicial, administrative or other third-party proceedings that could interrupt or limit our operations, require expensive remediation, result in adverse judgments, settlements or fines and create negative publicity.\nGovernmental agencies may, among other things, impose fines or penalties on us relating to the conduct of our business, attempt to revoke or deny renewal of our operating permits, franchises or licenses for violations or alleged violations of environmental laws or regulations or as a result of third-party challenges, require us to install additional pollution control equipment or require us to remediate potential environmental problems relating to any real property that we or our predecessors ever owned, leased or operated or any waste that we or our predecessors ever collected, transported, disposed of or stored. Individuals, citizens groups, trade associations or environmental activists may also bring actions against us in connection with our operations that could interrupt or limit the scope of our business. Any adverse outcome in such proceedings could harm our operations and financial results and create negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, competitive position and stock price. We may also be required to take corrective actions, including, but not limited to, installing additional equipment, which could require us to make substantial capital expenditures. We could also be required to indemnify our employees in connection with any expenses or liabilities that they may incur individually in connection with regulatory action against us. These could result in a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe currently have an illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock is and may remain illiquid and volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future. Factors that could affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nour actual or anticipated operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserves estimates;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and cash flows, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in revenue, cash flows or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf\npublic reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or other shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf\nthe limited amount of our freely tradable common stock available in the public marketplace;\n\u25cf\ngeneral financial market conditions and oil and natural gas industry market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u25cf\nthe realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf\nthe prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we produce;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol \u201cPED.\u201d Our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to the limited volume of our shares which trade, we believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not reflect the actual value of our common stock. Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in us.\nAdditionally, as a result of the illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or, if one develops, be sustained.\nAn active liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop in the future.\nOur common stock currently trades on the NYSE MKT, although our common stock\u2019s trading volume is very low. Liquid and active trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. However, our common stock may continue to have limited trading volume, and many investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or, if one develops, be sustained.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on or repurchase any shares of our common stock.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock or to repurchase any shares of our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Cash dividend payments in the future may only be made out of legally available funds and, if we experience substantial losses, such funds may not be available. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment, and there is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price paid by you.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes will cause immediate and substantial dilution.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of our outstanding convertible bridge notes in the aggregate amount of $475,000 in principal and $48,000 of payment in kind, along with interest on the principal amount of such notes, which allow the holders thereof the right to convert such amounts from time to time, subject to certain limitations, into common stock of the Company, as is determined by dividing the amount converted by a conversion price by the greater of (i) 80% of the average of the closing price per share of our publicly traded common stock for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the conversion notice provide by the holder; and (ii) $0.50 per share, will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nIn addition, that certain Amended and Restated Secured Subordinated Promissory Note, in the principal amount $4.925 million, dated February 19, 2015, issued by the Company to MIE Jurassic Energy Corporation (\u201cMIEJ\u201d), provides MIEJ the right, beginning March 8, 2017, to convert the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, into common stock of the Company at a price equal to 80% of the average closing price per share of common stock over the then previous 60 days from the date MIEJ exercises its conversion right, subject to a floor price of $0.30 per share of common stock. Any such issuances of common stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nThe continuously adjustable conversion price feature of our convertible notes could require us to issue a substantially greater number of shares, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution of their investment upon conversion of the convertible bridge notes and New MIEJ Note. The convertible bridge notes are convertible into shares of common stock as described in the risk factor above entitled \u201cThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes will cause immediate and substantial dilution\u201d, at a discount to the trading price of our common stock, subject to a floor of $0.50 per share, and the New MIEJ Note is convertible into shares of common stock as described in the same risk factor after March 8, 2017 at a discount to the trading price of our common stock, subject to a floor of $0.30 per share and other restrictions. As a result, the number of shares issuable could prove to be significantly greater in the event of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock, which decrease could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. As sequential conversions and sales take place, the price of our common stock may decline, and if so, the holders of the convertible bridge notes and New MIEJ Note would be entitled to receive an increasing number of shares, which could then be sold, triggering further price declines and conversions for even larger numbers of shares, which would cause additional dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nBecause we are a small company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we must comply with the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, including certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Act, related rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE MKT, with which a private company is not required to comply. Complying with these laws, rules and regulations will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses, which we cannot estimate accurately at this time. Among other things, we must:\n\u25cf\nestablish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u25cf\ncomply with rules and regulations promulgated by the NYSE MKT;\n\u25cf\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u25cf\nmaintain various internal compliance and disclosures policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading in our common stock;\n\u25cf\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities;\n\u25cf\nmaintain a comprehensive internal audit function; and\n\u25cf\nmaintain an investor relations function.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may require us to accept less director and officer liability insurance coverage than we desire or to incur substantial costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our shareholders might sell shares of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. Up to $100,000,000 in total aggregate value of securities have been registered by us on a \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-214415) that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 20, 2016, and which was declared effective on January 17, 2017. To date, an aggregate of approximately $17.5 million in securities have been sold by us under the prior Form S-3 which the December 2016 Form S-3 replaced, leaving approximately $82.5 million in securities which will be eligible for sale in the public markets from time to time, when sold and issued by us, subject to the requirements of Form S-3, which limits us, until such time, if ever, as our public float exceeds $75 million, from selling securities in a public primary offering under Form S-3 with a value exceeding more than one-third of the aggregate market value of the common stock held by non-affiliates of the Company every twelve months. We have also entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or sales agreement, with National Securities Corporation, or NSC, relating to up to $2.0 million of shares of our common stock which may be offered from time to time in \u201cat the market offerings\u201d and filed a final prospectus in connection with such offering with the SEC, provided that to date, we have not sold any securities under the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement or the prospectus associated therewith. Additionally, if our existing shareholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. The market price for shares of our common stock may drop significantly when such securities are sold in the public markets. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nOur outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding stock options to purchase approximately 5,187,223 shares of our common stock and outstanding warrants to purchase approximately 12,566,079 shares of common stock. For the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We previously filed registration statements with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of an aggregate of approximately 16,349,138 shares of our common stock, issued, issuable or reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration of lockup agreements, any management 10b5-1 plans and certain restrictions on sales by affiliates, shares registered under registration statements on Form S-8 will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSeven of our directors and executive officers own approximately 17.5% of our common stock, and three of our major shareholders own approximately 17.6% of our common stock, which may give them influence over important corporate matters in which their interests are different from your interests.\nSeven of our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 17.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and our largest three non-director or officer shareholders own approximately 17.6% of our outstanding voting shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock (excluding exercise of warrants and options and other convertible securities held thereby) based on a total of 54,997,742 shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of March 22, 2017. These directors, executive officers and major shareholders will be positioned to influence or control to some degree the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of formation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. These directors, executive officers and major shareholders, subject to any fiduciary duties owed to the shareholders generally, may have interests different than the rest of our shareholders. Their influence or control of our company may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other shareholders. In addition, due to the ownership interest of these directors and officers in our common stock, they may be able to remain entrenched in their positions.\nProvisions of Texas law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if it might be beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions of Texas law may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Under Texas law, a shareholder who beneficially owns more than 20% of our voting stock, or any \u201caffiliated shareholder,\u201d cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an affiliated shareholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors before this person became an affiliated shareholder or approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting shares not beneficially owned by the affiliated shareholder.\nOur board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred stock, which could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock and make a change of control of our company more difficult even if it might benefit our shareholders.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers, preferences and other rights and limitations of the preferred stock. Shares of preferred stock may be issued by our board of directors without shareholder approval, with voting powers and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers as determined by our board of directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding. As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our board of directors which cause the holders to have majority voting power over our shares, provide the holders of the preferred stock the right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may cause substantial dilution to our then common stock shareholders and/or have other rights and preferences greater than those of our common stock shareholders including having a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends or distributions on liquidation or dissolution. To date our board of directors has authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the rights and preferences associated therewith, and risks related to such preferred stock, is described in greater detail under \u201cRisks Related to Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d. We have also agreed to issue Series B Preferred stock in the event the GOM Merger closes as described in greater detail above under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d - \u201cBusiness Overview\u201d - \u201cRecent Developments\u201d - \u201cGOM Holdings, LLC Merger Agreement\u201d.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. Additionally, the dilutive effect of any preferred stock which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such preferred stock may have voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide the preferred shareholders with substantial voting control over us subsequent to the date of this filing and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control, even if that change in control might benefit our shareholders. As a result, the issuance of shares of common stock and/or preferred stock may cause the value of our securities to decrease.\nSecurities analysts may not cover, or continue to cover, our common stock and this may have a negative impact on our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over independent analysts (provided that we have engaged various non-independent analysts). We currently only have a few independent analysts that cover our common stock, and these analysts may discontinue coverage of our common stock at any time. Further, we may not be able to obtain additional research coverage by independent securities and industry analysts. If no independent securities or industry analysts continue coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nShareholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.\nWherever possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE MKT (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nWe are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE MKT and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE MKT. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE MKT may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE MKT inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE MKT considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time) and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE MKT (provided that issuers can also be delisted if any shares of the issuer trade below $0.06 per share); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE MKT, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nIf the NYSE MKT delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe are required to complete a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock prior to May 3, 2017, in order to continue to trade our common stock on the NYSE MKT.\nOn November 3, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE MKT that our common stock had been selling for a low price per share (i.e., under $0.20 per share), for a substantial period of time, and that our continued listing on the NYSE MKT was predicated on us completing a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock by May 3, 2017. Pursuant to the rules of the NYSE MKT, if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE MKT considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time) and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split after notification by the NYSE MKT (provided that issuers can also be delisted if any shares of the issuer trade below $0.06 per share), the NYSE MKT may delist the securities of such issuer. The NYSE MKT also advised us that we were \u2018below compliance\u2019 with applicable NYSE MKT listing standards due to the low trading price of our common stock and that a \u201c.BC\u201d indicator would be affixed to our trading symbol until such time as we regained compliance with the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing standards. While the Company obtained stockholder approval for a reverse stock split at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders on December 28, 2016, in the event we fail to effect a reverse stock split by May 3, 2017, the NYSE MKT may delist our common stock. If the NYSE MKT delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations. In addition, delisting from the NYSE MKT might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. Finally, if we were delisted from the NYSE MKT and are not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 registration statements, which may delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and could increase the expenses of any offering.\nWe are currently below compliance with certain continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT. If we are delisted from the NYSE MKT, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock may be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nOn December 27, 2016, we received notice from the NYSE MKT LLC (the \u201cExchange\u201d) that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (\u201cCompany Guide\u201d) since we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $6,000,000 at September 30, 2016 and had incurred net losses in our five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015. Receipt of the letter does not have any immediate effect upon the listing of our common stock, provided that in order to maintain our listing on the Exchange, the Exchange requested that we submit a plan of compliance (the \u201cPlan\u201d) by January 27, 2017 addressing how we intend to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide by June 27, 2018. We submitted our Plan to the Exchange by the requested deadline, and such plan was accepted by the Exchange on February 13, 2017. In connection with such acceptance, we have been provided until June 27, 2018 to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide, which requires our stockholders\u2019 equity to be at least $6 million. If we do not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan period or regain compliance with the applicable continued listing standards of the Exchange by June 27, 2018, the Exchange will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. We are confident that we will be able to regain compliance with applicable listing standards by June 27, 2018, provided that if we are unable to regain compliance, our common stock will be delisted from the Exchange.\nIf our common stock is delisted, it could come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and could be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nDue to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our costs and expenses.\nWe are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and are required to pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase our expenses and may make it more complicated or time consuming for us to undertake certain corporate actions due to the fact that we may require NYSE approval for such transactions and/or NYSE rules may require us to obtain shareholder approval for such transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock will cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.\nOur 66,625 outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock are convertible into common stock on a 1,000:1 basis (subject to certain limitations on conversions described in the Series A Preferred designation), provided that no conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock is allowed in the event the holder thereof would beneficially own more than 9.9% of our common stock or voting stock.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders since the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may ultimately receive and sell the full amount of shares issuable in connection with the conversion of such Series A Convertible Preferred stock. Although the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may not be converted if such conversion would cause the holder thereof to own more than 9.9% of our outstanding common stock, this restriction does not prevent the holder from converting some of its holdings, selling those shares, and then converting the rest of its holdings, while still staying below the 9.9% limit. In this way, the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock could sell more than this limit while never actually holding more shares than this limit allows. If the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock chooses to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our common stock.\nThe issuance and sale of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may depress the market price of our common stock.\nAll of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is held by GGE, the parent company of which is controlled by a court-appointed liquidator that is currently taking steps to liquidate GGE\u2019s parent company\u2019s assets. If GGE were to distribute our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in connection with such liquidation, and/or these shares are converted in sequential conversions and sales of such converted shares take place, the price of our common stock may decline.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of the company\u2019s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which shareholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb converted shares sold by the Series A Convertible Preferred stock holder, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nThe holder of our Series A Convertible Preferred stock has the right to appoint two members to our board of directors.\nIn February 2015, by resolution of the board of directors, we formally increased the size of our board of directors from three (3) members to five (5) members. Pursuant to the designation of the Series A Convertible Preferred stock, we provided the holder thereof the right, upon notice to us, to appoint designees to fill the two (2) vacant seats, one of which must be an independent director as defined by applicable rules. In July 2015, David Z. Steinberg joined our board of directors as one of the holder\u2019s independent director designees. The holder\u2019s second designee has not been appointed to date. Mr. Steinberg was formerly employed by PM LLC, the former advisor and former affiliate of PPVAF, GOM, RJC and GGE, from May 2009 to November 2016. The board appointment rights continue until the holder no longer holds any of the first tranche of shares issued to the holder. The board appointment rights mean that assuming such rights are exercised; the common stock shareholders may only have the right to appoint 60% (three of five members) of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 14135, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PED"}
