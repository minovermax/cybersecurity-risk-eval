RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Economic and Political Conditions\nThe extent to which the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe novel strain of the coronavirus identified in late 2019 has spread across the globe and has resulted in governmental and other regulatory authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus and its variants, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, as well as the work force, operations and financial prospects of our customers, suppliers and business partners. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures, such as restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our customers, suppliers and business partners. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees, expanding the number of our associates who work from\nhome, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and tradeshows), and we may take further actions as may be required by governmental and other regulatory authorities or as we determine are necessary to protect the safety or best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners.\nImpacts our businesses are experiencing from COVID-19 include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022The ability of our businesses to visit current and potential customers in order to solicit new business and/or provide necessary on-site installation, implementation and training services has been impacted by the pandemic, which has, in some cases, limited our ability to obtain new business and effectively service existing business;\n\u2022Government restrictions on non-emergency hospital procedures resulted in decreased (1) demand in our businesses that provide medical products used in non-emergency procedures and (2) revenue related to pharmaceutical utilization in post-acute healthcare settings;\n\u2022The unprecedented slowdown and/or shut down of global economy sectors and the related uncertain timeline to reopen and recover, particularly in areas experiencing a more severe outbreak of the virus, has created a weak demand environment for our businesses serving industrial and energy markets; and\n\u2022Some of our customers, including those in the medical field, may seek to delay payments to us while they are addressing the numerous challenges presented by COVID-19; to date, such delays have not impacted the timing of our cash flow in a significant manner.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus including distribution and administration of available vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. After the COVID-19 outbreak subsides, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and its variants as a global pandemic may have on our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. In addition, the rapidly changing situation could give rise to additional risks or adverse impacts of which we are not presently aware, such as the ability to complete acquisitions, the ability to obtain credit through the capital markets and/or through our revolving credit facility. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economic and political environment as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described below in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, 19% of our net revenues and 15% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the U.S. We expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. Our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the U.S. including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022adverse changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022oil price volatility;\n\u2022trade protection measures, tariffs, and import or export requirements;\n\u2022subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations;\n\u2022partial or total expropriation;\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022differing labor regulations;\n\u2022differing protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022differing and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $9,566.5 in total consolidated indebtedness. In addition, we had $1,351.0 undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility. Subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions.\nOur level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. For example, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;\n\u2022limit our ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022limit our ability to make capital expenditures;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.\nUnfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business.\nSeveral of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar represented 16% of our total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings.\nOur technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nMany of our products and services rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nOur future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. We intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired\nbusinesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues, profitability or cash flows.\nAcquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.\nOur business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacture and distribution of our products. In addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. We currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses. We also maintain other insurance policies, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. We believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. However, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.\nIn some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. The loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows. Additionally, many of our customers are government entities. In many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe face intense competition from numerous competitors in our various businesses. Our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities. We may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive.\nSome of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy.\nSome of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. Accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. If demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on material portions of our business.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets, and any write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $14,395.2 compared to $10,479.8 of stockholders\u2019 equity, and represented 60% of our total assets of $24,024.8. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating income. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, the effect of which could be material.\nWe depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business.\nThe future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile. This product development may require substantial internal investment. There can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. Failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations.\nOur business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyber-attacks, other external hazards and/or human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. For example, Vertafore determined that as a result of human error, three data files containing Texas driver\u2019s license data were inadvertently stored in an unsecured external storage service that appears to have been accessed without authorization. As a result, Vertafore has been named as a defendant in a number of putative class actions regarding the incident.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its businesses, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including, but not limited to, cloud providers and providers of network management services. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers, including incidents similar to the \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d attack commonly referred to as the SolarWinds security breach. Moreover, as more of our employees work remotely due to the COVID 19 pandemic or otherwise, our networks and systems may be more susceptible to breach or sabotage due to employee misuse or error which may increase the risk of access to our systems by unauthorized parties.\nOur customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and services, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises, and such cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, damage to our IT systems, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines, diminution in the value of our investment in research and development, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.\nThe availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nRegulation of privacy and data security may adversely affect sales of our products and services and result in increased compliance costs.\nThere has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, increased regulation with respect to the collection, use and handling of personal, financial and other information as regulatory authorities in the United States and around the world have recently passed or are currently considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, privacy and data security. This includes the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect in January 2020, and the GDPR, which is a European Union-wide legal framework to govern data collection, use and sharing and related consumer privacy rights that became effective in May 2018. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The GDPR provides significant penalties for non-compliance (up to 4% of global revenue). European data protection authorities have already imposed fines for GDPR violations up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of Euros. Many states in the United States are also considering their own privacy laws that, in the absence of a preemptive Federal privacy law, could impose burdensome and conflicting requirements. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the United States, Europe and elsewhere can be uncertain and currently is in flux. Cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, including data localization requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data, the operational and cost impact of which cannot be fully known at this time. In addition to the possibility of fines, application of these existing laws in a manner inconsistent with our data and privacy practices could result in an order requiring that we change our data and privacy practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Also, any new law or regulation, or interpretation of existing law or regulation, imposing greater fees or taxes or restriction on the collection, use or transfer of information or data internationally or over the Web, could result in a decline in the use and adversely affect sales of our products and services and our results of operations. Finally, as we increasingly become a provider of technology solutions, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and the information we make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices, and our inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers, particularly customers in highly-regulated industries, such as the healthcare industry, and could result in regulatory actions, fines, legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand, reputation and our business.\nWe export a significant portion of our products. Difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business.\nSales to customers outside the U.S. by our businesses located in the U.S. account for a significant portion of our net revenues. These sales accounted for 7% and 10% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. Such risks include, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions\u2019 export requirements;\n\u2022restrictions on the export of technology and related products;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions\u2019 export policies to certain countries;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and\n\u2022a general economic downturn in our foreign markets.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions, could harm our operating results.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. Leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business.\nAny business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, incidents of directed cyber attacks, public health crisis or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance.\nIf terrorist activity, armed conflict, directed cyber attacks, political instability, public health crisis, such as an epidemic or pandemic related to the COVID-19, or natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. A prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. Any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services, or who purchase goods and services from us, will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. Notably, the global COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened risk that third parties may be unable to perform their obligations or suffer financial distress due to the global economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the spread of the virus, however, we are unable predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on any of our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions or their ability to perform their obligations. If third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us. In such events, we may incur losses, or our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected.\nLegal proceedings in which we are, or may be, a party may adversely affect us.\nWe are currently, and may in the future, become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers, intellectual property matters, third party liability, including product liability claims, and employment claims. We are and may in the future become subject to litigation regarding data or privacy incidents, as more fully described above in \u201cWe rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations\u201d.\nA downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs.\nUnfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets may be impacted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase. Additionally, our credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.", "PERMNO": 77338, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "ROP"}
