RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors that follow relate in each case to the Company, and where indicated the risk factors also relate to Consolidated SCE&G.\nThere may be significant challenges to successfully integrate the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s businesses with Dominion Energy.\nSignificant management attention and resources will be required to integrate the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s businesses with Dominion Energy. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe complexities associated with integrating the Company, including its utility businesses, while at the same time providing consistent, high quality services;\n\u2022\nthe complexities of integrating a company with different markets and customers;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract and retain key employees;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing political and regulatory conditions related to the Company's utility businesses;\n\u2022\nthe moratorium on filing requests for adjustments in SCE&G's base electric rates until 2020 with no change in rates until January 1, 2021, which limits the ability to recover increases in non-fuel related costs of electric operations for SCE&G\u2019s customers;\n\u2022\nthe stipulation agreement approved by the NCUC, which provides for a rate moratorium at PSNC Energy until November 1, 2021, with certain exceptions; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by integrating the Company's businesses.\nFor these reasons, it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of the Company's and Consolidated SCE&G's management, the disruption of each of their ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in their services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the Company or Consolidated SCE&G to maintain or establish relationships with current and prospective customers, vendors and employees or could otherwise adversely affect their businesses and financial results.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G are subject to the reputational risks that may result from a failure to adhere to high standards related to compliance with laws and regulations, ethical conduct, operational effectiveness, customer service and the safety of employees, customers and the public. In addition, the Company and Consolidated SCE&G have been and may continue to be adversely affected by negative publicity related to the abandonment of the Nuclear Project.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G are committed to operational excellence, to quality customer service, and, through an ethics and compliance program, to maintain high standards of ethical conduct in our business operations. A failure to meet these commitments, or a perceived failure to meet these commitments, may subject the Company and Consolidated SCE&G not only to fraud, regulatory action, litigation or financial loss, but also to reputational risk that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s access to capital, and result in further regulatory oversight. In addition, traditional news media and social media can very rapidly convey information, whether factual or not, to large numbers of people, including customers, investors, regulators, legislators and other stakeholders, and the failure to effectively manage timely, accurate communication through these channels could adversely impact our reputation.\nPolitical and public sentiment in connection with the abandonment of the Nuclear Project has resulted in and may continue to result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Company and Consolidated SCE&G. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims in addition to those which have already occurred or are currently pending. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, as well as responding to and addressing adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, can divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s respective businesses.\nAddressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s respective businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe rates that the Company and Consolidated SCE&G can charge customers are subject to regulatory review.\nRevenue provided by the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s operations is based primarily on rates approved by state regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.\nThe Company\u2019s retail gas base rates for distribution services to customers in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service basis subject to North Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the NCUC. Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s retail electric bases rates for services to customers in South Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to South Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the SCSPC. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the SCPSC, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the SCPSC, which may decrease Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s future earnings. If the NCUC and SCPSC do not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s future earnings could be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews.\nThe Company and SCE&G are subject to numerous legal proceedings and ongoing governmental investigations and examinations.\nThe Company and SCE&G are defendants in numerous federal and state legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the decision to abandon construction at the Nuclear Project. Among other things, the lawsuits and investigations allege misrepresentation, failure to properly manage the Nuclear Project, unfair trade practices and violation of anti-trust laws. The plaintiffs seek a judgment that SCE&G many not charge its customers for any past or continuing costs of the Nuclear Project, among other remedies.\nAdditionally, the Company and SCE&G are defendants in federal and state legal proceedings relating to the SCANA Combination. Among other things, the lawsuits allege improper disclosures and breaches of various fiduciary duties. Remedies sought include rescinding the SCANA Combination.\nThe outcome of these legal proceedings, investigations and examinations is uncertain and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G have engaged in activities for which they have claimed research and experimentation tax deductions and credits and tax abandonment losses, all of which are the subject of uncertainty.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G have claimed significant research and experimentation tax deductions and credits related to the design and construction activities of Unit 2 and Unit 3. A significant portion of these claims followed the issuance of final IRS regulations in 2014 regarding such treatment with respect to expenditures related to the design and construction of pilot models. The Company and Consolidated SCE&G have also claimed a significant tax deduction related to the decision to stop construction and to abandon the Nuclear Project in 2017.\nThese tax claims primarily involve the timing of recognition of tax deductions rather than permanent tax attributes, and their permanent attributes (net), as well as most of the interest accruals required to be recorded with respect to them, had been deferred within regulatory assets. As such, until December 31, 2017 when these deferrals were considered to be impaired, these claims had not had, and were not expected to have in the future, significant direct effects on the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s results of operations. Nonetheless, the claims contributed significantly to the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s cash flows by providing a significant source of capital and lessening the level of debt and equity financing that the Company and Consolidated SCE&G were required to raise in the financial markets.\nThe claims made to date are under examination and, even though a favorable PLR regarding the 2017 abandonment loss related to the Nuclear Project was obtained, all such claims are considered uncertain. To the extent that any of these claims are not sustained as ordinary losses on examination or through any subsequent appeal, the Company and Consolidated SCE&G will be required to repay any cash received for tax benefit claims which are ultimately disallowed, along with interest on those amounts. Such amounts could be significant and could adversely affect the Company's and Consolidated SCE&G's liquidity, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. In certain circumstances, which management considers to be remote, penalties for underpayment of income taxes could also be assessed.\nAn inability to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our operations and ability to generate cash flow.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G are dependent on certain financing arrangements with Dominion Energy for any borrowings necessary to meet our working capital and other financial needs. If Dominion Energy\u2019s funding resources were to become unavailable to Dominion Energy, the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s access to funding would also be in jeopardy. In the future, an inability to obtain additional financing from other sources on acceptable terms could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flows, anticipated financial results or impair our ability to generate additional cash flows. The ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future debt offerings may be limited by the financial condition of the Company or Consolidated SCE&G at the time of any such financing or offering or other debt agreements in place at the time, adverse market conditions or other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control.\nSCE&G also relies on a credit facility with banks to meet short-term funding needs. Banks may be unable or unwilling to extend credit in the future. From time to time, SCE&G may use interest-rate derivatives to fix the rate on a portion of its variable-rate debt. A downgrade of credit ratings could increase the interest cost of debt and decrease future availability of capital from banks and other sources. While management believes it is important to maintain investment-grade credit ratings to conduct SCE&G\u2019s businesses, SCE&G may not be able to keep investment-grade ratings.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require significant capital expenditures, can increase our costs of operations and may impact our business plans or expose us to environmental liabilities.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to water quality and air emissions (such as reducing NOX, SO2, mercury and particulate matter). Some form of regulation is expected at the federal and state levels to impose regulatory requirements specifically directed at reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. For example, on August 21, 2018, the EPA proposed a replacement rule to the CPP, known as the ACE rule, which will establish guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. However, a number of bills have been introduced in Congress that seek to require GHG emissions reductions from fossil fuel-fired electric generation facilities, natural gas facilities and other sectors of the economy, although none has yet been enacted. Furthermore, the EPA finalized standards under the CWA governing effluent limitation guidelines for electric generating units in September 2015. While the rule setting forth these standards has been stayed administratively, the EPA has begun a new rulemaking process that could take until 2020 before revisions to the effluent limitation guidelines for electric generating units is complete.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations requires us to commit significant resources toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emissions fees and permitting at our facilities. These expenditures have been significant in the past and are expected to continue or increase in the future. Changes in compliance requirements, additional regulations and related costs, or more restrictive interpretations by governmental authorities of existing requirements may impose additional costs on us (such as more stringent clean-up of contaminated sites or reduced emission allowances) or require us to incur additional expenditures or curtail some of our cost savings activities (such as the recycling of fly ash and other coal combustion products for beneficial use). Compliance with any GHG emission reduction requirements, including any mandated renewable portfolio standards, also may impose significant costs on us, and the resulting price increases to our customers may lower customer consumption. Such costs of compliance with environmental regulations could negatively impact our businesses and our results of operations and financial position, especially if emissions or discharge limits are reduced or more onerous permitting requirements or additional regulatory requirements are imposed. Additionally, there can be no assurance that a federal tax or fee for carbon emitting generating facilities will not be imposed.\nThe compliance costs of these environmental laws and regulations are important considerations in the Company's and Consolidated SCE&G's strategic planning and, as a result, significantly affect the decisions to construct, operate, and retire facilities, including generating facilities. In turn, they affect the costs and rates of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G.\nCommodity price changes, delays in delivery of commodities, commodity availability and other factors may affect the operating cost, capital expenditures and competitive positions of the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s energy businesses.\nOur energy businesses are sensitive to changes in coal, natural gas, uranium and other commodity prices (as well as their transportation costs), availability and deliverability. Any such changes could affect the prices these businesses charge, their operating costs, and the competitive position of their products and services. While Consolidated SCE&G is permitted to recover the prudently incurred cost of purchased power and fuel (including transportation) used in electric generation through retail customers\u2019 bills, such cost increases affect electric prices and therefore the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources. In addition, when natural gas prices are low enough relative to coal to result in the dispatch of gas-fired electric generation ahead of coal-fired electric generation, higher inventories of coal, with related increased carrying costs, may result. This may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn the case of regulated natural gas operations, costs prudently incurred for purchased gas and pipeline capacity may be recovered through retail customers\u2019 bills. However, in both our regulated and deregulated natural gas markets, increases in gas costs affect total retail prices and therefore the competitive position of gas relative to electricity and other forms of energy. Accordingly, customers able to do so may switch to alternate forms of energy and reduce their usage of gas from the Company and Consolidated SCE&G. Customers on a volumetric rate structure unable to switch to alternate fuels or suppliers may reduce their usage of gas from the Company and Consolidated SCE&G. A regulatory mechanism applies to residential and commercial customers at PSNC Energy to mitigate the earnings impact of an increase or decrease in gas usage.\nCertain construction-related commodities, such as copper and aluminum used in our transmission and distribution lines and in our electrical equipment, and steel, concrete and rare earth elements, have experienced significant price fluctuations due to changes in worldwide demand. To operate our air emissions control equipment, we use significant quantities of ammonia, limestone and lime. With EPA-mandated industry-wide compliance requirements for air emissions controls, increased demand for these reagents, combined with the increased demand for low sulfur coal, may result in higher costs for coal and reagents used for compliance purposes.\nChanging and complex laws and regulations to which the Company and Consolidated SCE&G are subject could adversely affect revenues, increase costs, or curtail activities.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G operate under the regulatory authority of the United States government and its various regulatory agencies, including the FERC, NRC, SEC, IRS, EPA, the Department of Homeland Security, CFTC and PHMSA. In addition, the Company and Consolidated SCE&G are subject to regulation by the state governments of South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia via regulatory agencies, state environmental agencies, and state employment commissions. Accordingly, the Company and Consolidated SCE&G must comply with extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. Such governmental oversight and regulation broadly and materially affect the operation of our businesses. In addition to many other aspects of our businesses, these requirements impact the services mandated or offered to our customers, and the licensing, siting, construction and operation of facilities. They affect our management of safety, the reliability of our electric and natural gas systems, the physical and cyber security of key assets, customer conservation through DSM Programs, information security, the issuance of securities and borrowing of money, financial reporting, interactions among affiliates, the pricing of utility services, the payment of dividends and employment programs and practices. Changes to governmental regulations are continual and potentially costly to effect compliance. Non-compliance with these requirements by third parties, such as our contractors, vendors and agents, may subject the Company and Consolidated SCE&G to operational risks and to liability. We cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on the Company\u2019s or Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s businesses. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations could result in fines, litigation, loss of licenses or permits, mandated capital expenditures and other adverse business outcomes, as well as reputational damage, which could adversely affect the cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G.\nFurthermore, changes in or uncertainty in monetary, fiscal, tax, economic, trade, or regulatory policies of the federal government may adversely affect the debt and equity markets and the economic climate for the nation, region or particular industries, such as ours or those of our customers. The Company and Consolidated SCE&G also could be adversely impacted by changes in tax policy, or taxes related to the usage of certain fuel types in our businesses or our ownership and/or operation of certain types of generating facilities. Future, unknown regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities also could impact the operations and finances of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G.\nSCE&G\u2019s electric operations in South Carolina and the Company\u2019s gas distribution operations in South Carolina and North Carolina are regulated by state utilities commissions. Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s generating facilities are subject to extensive regulation and oversight from the NRC and SCPSC. SCE&G's electric transmission system is subject to extensive regulations and oversight from the SCPSC, NERC and FERC. Implementing and maintaining compliance with the NERC's mandatory reliability standards, enforced by FERC, for bulk electric systems could result in higher operating costs and capital expenditures. Non-compliance with these standards could subject SCE&G to substantial monetary penalties. Our gas marketing operations in Georgia are subject to state regulatory oversight and, for a portion of its operations, to rate regulation. There can be no assurance that Georgia\u2019s gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as market conditions evolve.\nFurthermore, Dodd-Frank affects the use and reporting of derivative instruments. The regulations under this legislation provide for substantial additional regulation of over-the-counter and security-based derivative instruments, among other things, and require numerous rule-makings by the CFTC and the SEC to implement, many of which are still pending final action by those federal agencies. The Company and Consolidated SCE&G have determined that they meet the end-user exception to mandatory clearing of swaps under Dodd-Frank. In addition, the Company and Consolidated SCE&G have taken steps to ensure that they are not the party required to report these transactions in real-time (the \"reporting party\") by transacting solely with swap dealers and major swap participants, when possible, as well as entering into reporting party agreements with counterparties who also are not swap dealers or major swap participants, which establishes that those counterparties are obligated to report the transactions in accordance with applicable Dodd-Frank regulations. While these actions minimize the reporting obligations of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G, they do not eliminate required recordkeeping for any Dodd-Frank regulated transactions. Despite qualifying for the end-user exception to mandatory clearing and ensuring that neither the Company nor Consolidated SCE&G is the reporting party to a transaction required to be reported in real-time, we cannot predict when the final regulations will be issued or what requirements they will impose.\nHostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s business.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Company\u2019s and Consolidated\nSCE&G\u2019s facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.\nA successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Company and Consolidated SCE&G from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data at the Company or Consolidated SCE&G or one of their vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. While the Company and Consolidated SCE&G maintain property and casualty insurance, along with other contractual provisions, that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, all damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters, man-made mishaps and abnormal weather.\nThe Company has delivered less gas and, in deregulated markets, received lower prices for natural gas when weather conditions have been milder than normal, and as a consequence earned less income from those operations. Mild weather in the future could adversely impact the revenues and results of operations and harm the financial condition of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G. Hot or cold weather could result in higher bills for customers and result in higher write-offs of receivables and in a greater number of disconnections for non-payment. In addition, for the Company and Consolidated SCE&G, severe weather can be destructive, causing outages and property damage, adversely affecting operating expenses and revenues.\nNatural disasters (such as hurricanes or other significant weather events, electromagnetic events, earthquakes, flooding or fires) or man-made mishaps (such as natural gas transmission pipeline failure, electric utility companies' ash pond failures, and cyber-security failures experienced by many businesses) could have direct significant impacts on the Company and Consolidated SCE&G and on our key contractors and suppliers or could impact us through changes to federal, state or local policies, laws and regulations, and have a significant impact on our financial condition, operating expenses, and cash flows.\nThe costs of large capital projects, such as the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s construction and environmental compliance programs, are significant, and these projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect the cost, timing and completion of these projects.\nThe Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in electric generation and in other internal infrastructure projects, including projects for environmental compliance. Achieving the intended benefits of any large construction project is subject to many uncertainties. For instance, the ability to adhere to established budgets and construction schedules may be affected by many variables, such as the regulatory, legal, training and construction processes associated with securing approvals, permits and licenses and necessary amendments to them within projected time frames, the availability of labor and materials at estimated costs, the availability and cost of financing, and weather. There also may be contractor or supplier performance issues or adverse changes in their creditworthiness and/or financial stability, unforeseen difficulties meeting critical regulatory requirements, contract disputes and litigation, and changes in key contractors or subcontractors. There may be unforeseen engineering problems or unanticipated changes in project design or scope. Our ability to complete construction projects as well as our ability to maintain current operations at reasonable cost could be affected by the availability of key components or commodities, increases in the price of or the unavailability of labor, commodities or other materials, increases in lead times for components, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, new or enhanced environmental or regulatory requirements, supply chain failures (whether resulting from the foregoing or other factors), and disruptions in the transportation of components, commodities and fuels. To the extent that, in connection with the construction of a project, delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete the project, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as our qualifications for applicable governmental programs, benefits and tax credits may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s generating capacity is derived from nuclear power, the use of which exposes us to regulatory, environmental and business risks.\nSCE&G jointly owns and is the operator of Unit 1. Various risks of nuclear generation to which SCE&G is subject include the following:\n\u2022\nThe potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from a release of radioactive materials in connection with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;\n\u2022\nLimitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations or those of others in the United States;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that new laws and regulations could be enacted that could adversely affect the liability structure that currently exists in the United States;\n\u2022\nUncertainties, including trade disputes, with respect to procurement of nuclear fuel and suppliers thereof, fabrication of nuclear fuel and related vendors, and the storage of spent nuclear fuel;\n\u2022\nUncertainties with respect to contingencies if insurance coverage is inadequate;\n\u2022\nUncertainties with respect to possible future increased regulation of nuclear facilities and nuclear generation, and related costs thereof; and\n\u2022\nUncertainties with respect to the technological aspects of, and adequacy of funding for, decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their operating lives.\nSCE&G maintains a trust to minimize the financial risks associated with the decommissioning of Unit 1; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trust. If assets in the trust are insufficient to cover the eventual costs of decommissioning, and if SCE&G is unable to recover the shortfall through regulatory means, the Company's and Consolidated SCE&G's results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours. In today\u2019s environment, there is a heightened risk of terrorist attack on the nation\u2019s nuclear facilities, which has resulted in increased security costs at our nuclear plant. Although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident, a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit, resulting in costly changes to units in operation and adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, a major incident at a domestic nuclear facility could result in retrospective premium assessments under our nuclear insurance coverages.\nPotential competitive changes may adversely affect our gas and electricity businesses due to the loss of customers, reductions in revenues, or write-down of stranded assets.\nThe utility industry has been undergoing a structural change for a number of years, resulting in increasing competitive pressures on electric and natural gas utility companies. Competition in wholesale power sales via an RTO/ISO is in effect across much of the country, but the Southeastern utilities have retained the traditional bundled, vertically integrated structure. Should an RTO/ISO-market be implemented in the Southeast, potential risks emerge from reliance on volatile wholesale market prices as well as increased costs associated with new transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nSome states have also mandated or encouraged unbundled retail competition. Should this occur in South Carolina or North Carolina, increased competition may create greater risks to the stability of utility earnings generally and may in the future reduce earnings from retail electric and natural gas sales. In a deregulated environment, formerly regulated utility companies that are not responsive to a competitive energy marketplace may suffer erosion in market share, revenues and profits as competitors gain access to their customers. In addition, the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risk in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, a write-down in the value of the related assets could be required.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G are subject to the risk of loss of sales due to the growth of distributed generation especially in the form of renewable power such as solar photovoltaic systems, which systems have undergone a rapid decline in their costs. As a result of federal and state subsidies, potential regulations allowing third-party retail sales, and\nadvances in distributed generation technology, particularly when combined with storage solutions, the growth of such distributed generation could be significant in the future. Such growth will lessen the Company's and Consolidated SCE&G's sales and will slow growth, potentially causing higher rates to customers.\nRenewable and/or alternative electric generation portfolio standards may be enacted at the federal or state level. Such renewable energy may not be readily available in our service territories and could be costly to build, finance, acquire, integrate, and/or operate. Resulting increases in the price of electricity to recover the cost of these types of generation, and the costs of their integration to the electric system, could result in lower usage of electricity by our customers. In addition, DER generation at customers\u2019 facilities could result in the loss of sales to those customers. Compliance with potential future portfolio standards could significantly impact our capital expenditures and our results of operations and financial condition. Utility scale solar development companies are currently working in South Carolina to develop projects in SCE&G's service territory.\nProblems with operations could cause us to curtail or limit our ability to serve customers or cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCritical processes or systems in the Company\u2019s or Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s operations could become impaired or fail from a variety of causes, such as equipment breakdown, transmission equipment failure, information systems failure or security breach, operator error, natural disasters, and the effects of a pandemic, terrorist attack or cyber attack on our workforce or facilities or on vendors and suppliers necessary to maintain services key to our operations.\nIn particular, as the operator of power generation facilities, many of which entered service prior to 1985 and may be difficult to maintain, Consolidated SCE&G could incur problems, such as the breakdown or failure of power generation or emission control equipment, transmission equipment, or other equipment or processes which would result in performance below assumed levels of output or efficiency. The integration of a significant amount of distributed generation into our systems may entail additional cycling of our coal-fired generation facilities and may thereby increase the number of unplanned outages at those facilities. In addition, any such breakdown or failure may result in Consolidated SCE&G purchasing emission allowances or replacement power at market rates, if such allowances and replacement power are available at all. These purchases are subject to state regulatory prudency reviews for recovery through rates. If replacement power is not available, such problems could result in interruptions of service (blackout or brownout conditions) in all or part of SCE&G\u2019s territory or elsewhere in the region. Similarly, a natural gas line failure of the Company or Consolidated SCE&G could affect the safety of the public, destroy property, and interrupt our ability to serve customers.\nEvents such as these could entail substantial repair costs, litigation, fines and penalties, and damage to reputation, each of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G's revenues, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Insurance may not be available or adequate to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events.\nThe use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. The Company and Consolidated SCE&G do not fully hedge against financial market risks or price changes in commodities. This could result in increased costs, thereby resulting in lower margin.\nThe Company and Consolidated SCE&G may use derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage our financial market risks. The Company also uses such derivative instruments to manage certain commodity (i.e., natural gas) market risk. We could be required to provide cash collateral or recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities and financial contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. We could also be required to provide additional cash collateral if credit rating agency downgrades of our debt trigger more stringent requirements.\nThe Company strives to manage commodity price exposure by establishing risk limits and utilizing various financial instruments (exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments) to hedge physical obligations and reduce price volatility. We do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility or our hedges are not effective, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nFailure to retain and attract key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s operations and financial performance, particularly in light of uncertainties related to and resulting from regulatory, legislative and legal proceedings and integration.\nA significant portion of our workforce will be eligible for retirement during the next few years. Uncertainties related to regulatory, legislative and legal proceedings, as well as the continuing integration of companies, also weigh significantly on the\nemployment considerations made by current and prospective employees, and some workforce attrition has occurred. We must attract, retain and develop executive officers and other professional, technical and craft employees with the skills and experience necessary to successfully manage, operate and grow our businesses. Competition for these employees is high, and in some cases, we must compete for these employees on a regional or national basis. We may be unable to attract and retain these personnel. Further, the Company\u2019s or Consolidated SCE&G\u2019s ability to construct or maintain generation or other assets requires the availability of suitable skilled contractor personnel. We may be unable to obtain appropriate contractor personnel at the times and places needed. Labor disputes with employees or contractors covered by collective bargaining agreements also could adversely affect implementation of our strategic plan and our operational and financial performance. Furthermore, increased medical benefit costs of employees and retirees could adversely affect the results of operations of the Company and Consolidated SCE&G. Medical costs in this country have risen significantly over the past number of years and such increases are expected to continue. Such increases, unless satisfactorily managed by the Company and Consolidated SCE&G, could adversely affect results of operations.", "PERMNO": 23085, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "SCG"}
