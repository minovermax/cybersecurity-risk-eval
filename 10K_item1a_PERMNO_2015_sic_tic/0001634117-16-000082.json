{"cik": "1634117", "company": "Barnes & Noble Education, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones faced by us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and the trading price of our Common Stock could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face significant competition in our business, and we expect such competition to increase.\nThe market for course materials, including textbooks and supplemental materials, is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We are experiencing growing competition from alternative media and alternative sources of textbooks and course-related materials, such as websites that sell textbooks, eTextbooks, digital content and other merchandise directly to students; online resources, including open educational resources; publishers bypassing the bookstore distribution channel by selling directly to students and educational institutions; print-on-demand textbooks; textbook rental companies; and student-to-student transactions over the Internet. We also have competition from other college bookstore operators and educational content providers, including Akademos, a virtual bookstore and marketplace for academic institutions; Amazon.com, an e-commerce operator and a provider of contract services to colleges and universities; BBA Solutions, a college textbook retailer; bn.com, the e-commerce platform of Barnes & Noble; Chegg.com, an online textbook rental company; CourseSmart, a digital course materials provider; eCampus, an online provider of course materials; Follett Corporation, a contract operator of campus bookstores; MBS Direct, an online bookstore provider; and Rafter, a course materials management solution for higher educational institutions. We also have competition from providers of eTextbooks, such as Apple iTunes, CourseSmart, Blackboard, Rafter and Google; and various private textbook rental websites. In addition, Amazon, Akademos and Rafter have recently begun to develop relationships with colleges and universities to provide online bookstore solutions. Many students purchase from multiple textbook providers, are highly price sensitive and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another. As a consequence, in addition to being competitive in the services we provide to our customers, our textbook business faces significant price competition. Some of our competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantial resources to marketing, website and systems development. In addition, a variety of business models are being pursued for the provision of print textbooks, some of which may be more profitable or successful than our business model.\nWe may not be able to enter into new contracts and contracts for existing or additional college and university affiliated bookstores may not be profitable.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to expand sales for our college bookstore operations by being awarded additional contracts to manage bookstores for colleges and universities. Our ability to obtain those additional contracts is subject to a number of factors that we are not able to control. In addition, the anticipated strategic benefits of new and additional college and university bookstores may not be realized at all or may not be realized within the time frames contemplated by management. In particular, contracts for additional managed stores may involve a number of special risks, including adverse short-term effects on operating results, diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources, standardization of accounting systems, dependence on retaining, hiring and training key personnel, unanticipated problems or legal liabilities, and actions of our competitors and customers. Because certain terms of any contract are generally fixed for the initial term of the contract and involve judgments and estimates that may not be accurate, including for reasons outside of our control, we have contracts that are not profitable and may have such contracts in the future. Even if we have the right to terminate a contract, we may be reluctant to do so even when a contract is unprofitable due to, among other factors, the potential effect on our reputation.\nWe may not be able to successfully retain or renew our managed bookstore contracts on profitable terms.\nWe face significant competition in retaining existing store contracts and when renewing those contracts as they expire. Our contracts are typically for five years with renewal options, but can range from one to 15 years, and most contracts are cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. We may not be successful in retaining our current contracts, renewing our current contracts or renewing our current contracts on terms that provide us the opportunity to improve or maintain the profitability of managing stores that are the subject matter of such contracts.\nOur business is dependent on the overall economic environment, college enrollment and consumer spending patterns.\nA deterioration of the current economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to fund our growth and strategic business initiatives. Our business is affected by funding levels at colleges and universities and by changes in enrollments at colleges and universities, changes in student enrollments and lower spending on textbooks and general merchandise. The growth of our business depends on our ability to attract new students and to increase the level of engagement by existing students. To the extent we are unable to attract new students or students spend less generally, our business could be adversely affected.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWe face the risk of disruption of supplier relationships and/or supply chain and/or inventory surplus.\nThe products that we sell originate from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. During Fiscal 2016, our four largest suppliers accounted for approximately 46% of our merchandise purchased, with the largest supplier accounting for approximately 19% of our merchandise purchased. While we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good, suppliers may modify the terms of these relationships due to general economic conditions or otherwise.\nWe do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content or services, particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling merchandise, content or services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, we may be unable to procure the same merchandise, content or services from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our business is dependent on the continued supply of textbooks. The publishing industry generally has suffered recently due to, among other things, changing consumer preferences away from the print medium and the economic climate. A significant disruption in this industry generally or a significant unfavorable change in our relationships with key suppliers could adversely impact our business. In addition, any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers including, payment terms, return policies, the discount or margin on products or changes to the distribution model of textbooks, could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Furthermore, certain of our merchandise is sourced indirectly from outside the United States. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of foreign-sourced merchandise.\nIn addition, we have significantly increased our textbook rental business, offering students a lower cost alternative to purchasing textbooks, which is also subject to certain inventory risks, such as textbooks not being resold or re-rented due to delayed returns or poor condition, or faculty members not continuing to adopt or use certain textbooks.\nWe are dependent upon access to the capital markets, bank credit facilities, and short-term vendor financing for liquidity needs.\nWe must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund working capital requirements. We believe that the combination of cash-on-hand, cash flow received from operations, funds available under our revolving senior credit facility and short-term vendor financing will be sufficient to meet our normal working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. If these sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, and the availability of credit. These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing, and our financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nOur business relies on certain key personnel.\nManagement believes that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of certain of our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of our officers or other employees.\nOur business is seasonal.\nOur business is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase textbooks for the upcoming semesters, and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Less than satisfactory net sales during our peak fiscal quarters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results for the year, and our results of operations from those quarters may not be sufficient to cover any losses that may be incurred in the other fiscal quarters of the year.\nOur results also depend on the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives. We may not be able to implement these strategies successfully, on a timely basis, or at all.\nOur ability to grow depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to implement our strategic initiatives to retain and expand existing customer relationships, acquire new accounts, expand sales channels and marketing efforts, develop and market higher education digital products and adapt to changing industry trends. While we believe we have the capital resources, experience, management resources and internal systems to successfully operate our business, we may not be successful in implementing these strategies. Further, even if successfully implemented, our business strategy may not ultimately produce positive results.\nOur strategy includes pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships and we may not be able to identify and successfully complete such transactions.\nAs part of our strategy, we have acquired, and, may in the future acquire, businesses or business operations, or enter into other business transactions, such as our recent acquisition of LoudCloud Systems, Inc. and strategic commercial agreement with Vital Source Technologies, Inc. We may not be able to identify suitable candidates for additional business combinations and strategic\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\ninvestments, obtain financing on acceptable terms for such transactions, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, if any, or otherwise consummate such transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Any strategic acquisitions or investments that we are able to identify and complete may also involve a number of risks, including our inability to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees; the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing business to integrate operations and personnel; possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during the integration process; becoming subject to contingent or other liabilities, including liabilities arising from events or conduct predating the acquisition that were not known to us at the time of the acquisition; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction, including the inability to achieve cost savings and synergies. Acquisitions may also have unanticipated tax, legal, regulatory and accounting ramifications, including recording goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges and incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets.\nOur international expansion could result in additional risks.\nHistorically, our operations have been limited to the United States; however, we contract with service providers outside the United States and we recently have acquired operations in India (and we may continue to expand internationally). Such international expansion may result in additional risks that are not present domestically and which could adversely affect our business or our results of operations, including compliance with additional United States regulations and those of other nations applicable to international operations; cultural and language differences; currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which are harder to predict in the current adverse global economic climate; restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; potentially adverse tax consequences and limitations on our ability to utilize losses generated in our foreign operations; different regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business; and different or less stable political and economic environments. Further, conducting business abroad subjects us to increased regulatory compliance and oversight. For example, in connection with our international operations, we are subject to laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory enforcement actions as well as substantial civil and criminal penalties assessed against us and our employees.\nWe face data security risks with respect to personal information.\nOur business involves the receipt, storage, processing and transmission of personal information about customers and employees. We may share information about such persons with vendors and third parties that assist with certain aspects of our business. Also, in connection with our student financial aid platform and the processing of university debit cards, we secure and have access to certain student personal information that has been provided to us by the universities we serve. Our handling and use of personal information is regulated at the international, federal and state levels and by industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. As an entity that provides services to institutions of higher education, we are contractually bound to handle certain personal information from student education records in accordance with the requirements of Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d). Privacy and information security laws, regulations, and industry standards change from time to time, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new processes and may be difficult to achieve. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, we could be subjected to legal risk. In addition, even if we fully comply with all laws, regulations and standards, and even though we have taken significant steps to protect personal information, we could experience a data security breach, and our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in a material breach of contract with one or more of our clients, lost future sales or decreased usage of credit and debit card products. Further, in the event that we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the U.S. Department of Education could require a client to suspend our access to their student information for at least five years. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our users\u2019 proprietary information and cause interruption in our operations. Any compromise of our data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage, increased operating costs associated with remediation, equipment acquisitions or disposal and added personnel, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business or affect investor confidence. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee.\nOur business could be impacted by changes in federal, state, local or international laws, rules or regulations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws relating to all aspects of our business. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, our access to student financial aid, pricing and availability of educational materials, competition and/or antitrust, content, copyrights, distribution, college distribution, mobile communications, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, digital content (including governmental investigations and litigation relating to the agency pricing model for digital content distribution), the characteristics and quality of products and services and employee benefits\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n(including the costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). Changes in federal, state, local or international laws, rules or regulations relating to these matters could increase our costs of doing business or otherwise impact our business.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations might adversely impact our businesses or financial performance.\nWe collected sales tax on the majority of the products and services that we sold in our respective prior fiscal years that were subject to sales tax, and we generally have continued the same policies for sales tax within the current fiscal year. While management believes that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K reflect management\u2019s best current estimate of any potential additional sales tax liability based on current discussions with taxing authorities, we cannot assure you that the outcome of any discussions with any taxing authority will not result in the payment of sales taxes for prior periods or otherwise, or that the amount of any such payments will not be materially in excess of any liability currently recorded. In the future, our businesses may be subject to claims for not collecting sales tax on the products and services we currently sell for which sales tax is not collected. In addition, our provision for income taxes and our obligation to pay income tax is based on existing federal, state and local tax laws. Changes to these laws, in particular as they relate to depreciation, amortization and cost of goods sold, could have a significant impact on our income tax provision, our projected cash tax liability, or both.\nOur expansion into new products, services and technologies subjects us to additional business, legal, financial and competitive risks.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to sustain or grow our business. Our gross profits and margins in our newer activities may be lower than in our traditional activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. In addition, we may have limited or no experience in our newer products and services, and our customers may not adopt our new product or service offerings. Some of these offerings may present new and difficult technological challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, domain name regulations, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights, including our use of the Barnes & Noble trademark. Laws and regulations may not adequately protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary or licensed rights.\nWe may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nOther parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. Because of the changes in Internet commerce and digital content businesses, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others.\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\nWe do not own the Barnes & Noble trademark and instead rely on a license of that trademark and certain other trademarks, which license imposes limits on what those trademarks can be used to do.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, Barnes & Noble granted us an exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up, non-transferable and non-assignable license to use the trademarks \u201cBarnes & Noble College,\u201d \u201cB&N College,\u201d \u201cBarnes & Noble Education\u201d and \u201cB&N Education\u201d and the non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up, non-transferable and non-assignable license to use the marks \u201cBarnes & Noble,\u201d \u201cB&N\u201d and \u201cBN,\u201d solely in connection with the contract management of college and university bookstores and other bookstores associated with academic institutions and related websites, as well as education products and services (including digital education products and services) and related websites. These restrictions may materially limit our ability to use the licensed marks in the expansion of our operations in the future. In addition, we are reliant on Barnes & Noble to maintain the licensed trademarks.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWe rely on third-party digital content and applications, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe contract with certain third-parties to offer their digital content. Our licensing arrangements with these third-parties do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for us to license our content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit our access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If we are unable to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Recent Spin-Off from Barnes & Noble\nWe could have an indemnification obligation to Barnes & Noble if the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition treatment.\nIf, due to any of our covenants in the Tax Matters Agreement being breached, it were determined as a tax matter that the Spin-Off did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, we could be required to indemnify Barnes & Noble for the resulting taxes and related expenses. In addition, Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), generally creates a presumption that the Spin-Off would be taxable to Barnes & Noble, but not to holders, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Spin-Off, unless it were established that such transactions and the Spin-Off were not part of a plan or series of related transactions giving effect to such a change in ownership. If the Spin-Off were taxable to Barnes & Noble due to such 50% or greater change in the ownership of our stock, Barnes & Noble would have to recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of our stock held by it immediately before the Spin-Off, and we generally would be required to indemnify Barnes & Noble for the tax on such gain and related expenses. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Barnes & Noble-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nWe have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe have agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355(e) of the Code. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might maximize the value of our business, and could discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Barnes & Noble-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe believe that, as an independent publicly-traded company, we will be able to, among other things, better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs, design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are targeted to our business, more effectively respond to industry dynamics and create effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance. However, following our separation from Barnes & Noble, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and have less leverage with suppliers, and we may experience other adverse events. In addition, we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent publicly-traded company, and we may experience increased costs after the Spin-Off.\nIn the past, Barnes & Noble provided us with various corporate services. Following the Spin-Off, Barnes & Noble has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than the transition services described under \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Barnes & Noble\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date. These services do not include every service that we have received from Barnes & Noble in the past, and Barnes & Noble is only obligated to provide these services for limited periods from the date of the Spin-Off. Accordingly, we now provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties, the services we previously received from Barnes & Noble prior to the Spin-Off. We may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from Barnes & Noble. We may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently or may incur additional costs. If we fail to obtain the services necessary to operate effectively or if we incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWe have limited operating history as an independent publicly-traded company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived the historical financial information (prior to the Spin-Off) included in this Form 10-K from Barnes & Noble\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company during the periods presented (prior to the Spin-Off) or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of Barnes & Noble\u2019s broader corporate organization, and Barnes & Noble performed various corporate functions for us. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from Barnes & Noble for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as an independent publicly-traded company.\n\u2022\nWe have entered into transactions with Barnes & Noble that did not exist prior to the Spin-Off and modified our existing agreements with Barnes & Noble, such as Barnes & Noble\u2019s provision of transition services, which will cause us to incur new costs.\n\u2022\nOur historical financial information does not reflect changes that we expect to experience in the future as a result of our separation from Barnes & Noble, including changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, tax structure, financing and business operations. As part of Barnes & Noble, we enjoyed certain benefits from Barnes & Noble\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power, borrowing leverage and available capital for investments, and we lost these benefits after the Spin-Off. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses or access capital markets on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of Barnes & Noble prior to the Spin-Off.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we are now also responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. In addition, certain costs incurred by Barnes & Noble, including executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, procurement, information technology and other shared services, had historically been allocated to us by Barnes & Noble; but these allocations may not reflect the future level of these costs to us as we provide these services ourselves. Therefore, our historical financial statements (prior to the Spin-Off) may not be indicative of our future performance as an independent publicly-traded company. We cannot assure you that our operating results will continue at a similar level when we are an independent publicly-traded company. For additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our financial statements, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Part II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\nWe may not be able to access the credit and capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed on acceptable terms.\nFrom time to time, we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe our current sources of capital will permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, we have not previously accessed the capital markets as an independent public company, and our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including our financial performance, our credit ratings or absence thereof, the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy. We cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed or on terms acceptable to us.\nWe may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Barnes & Noble.\nWe entered into agreements with Barnes & Noble related to our separation from Barnes & Noble, including the Separation Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement and Employee Matters Agreement, while we were still part of Barnes & Noble. Accordingly, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arms-length negotiations between unaffiliated parties. The terms of the agreements relate to, among other things, allocations of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between Barnes & Noble and us. We may have received better terms from third parties than we received from Barnes & Noble because third parties would have competed with each other to win our business, but we are now bound by the terms of the agreements we entered into with Barnes & Noble. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our Common Stock may trade. The market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our businesses;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies, including our digital education initiative;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industries;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our Common Stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our Company and the college bookstore industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThe concentration of our Common Stock ownership may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may involve other risks.\nA portion of our Common Stock is controlled by a few stockholders. This control may limit the ability of the Company\u2019s other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions with which our other stockholders do not agree.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, any return on your investment in our Common Stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in our business. Also, our credit agreements may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects and any other factors our Board deems relevant. Therefore, any return on your investment in our Common Stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our Common Stock. For more information, see Part II - Item 5. Market for Registrants - Dividends.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect to grant to our directors, officers and other employees. We have an incentive plan that provides for the grant of Common Stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future or as necessary to finance our ongoing operations.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated By-laws contain provisions which, together with applicable Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable, including provisions that:\n\u2022\ndivide our Board into three staggered classes of directors that are each elected to three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of a majority of our Board or the chairman of our Board; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominations.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of the Company, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their Common Stock at a price above the prevailing market price. See \u201cDescription of Our Capital Stock-Certain Provisions of Delaware Law, Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nOur Amended and Restated By-laws designate courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated By-laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the state and federal courts of the State of Delaware are the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated By-laws or (d) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
