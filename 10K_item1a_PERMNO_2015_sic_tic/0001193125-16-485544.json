{"cik": "884731", "company": "ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nTHE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE THOSE THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR COMPANY. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, THEY MAY MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nRisks relating to the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates\nWe depend heavily on the commercial success of our only approved cancer medicine, Iclusig\u00ae (ponatinib). If we do not achieve commercial success with Iclusig, our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer, and we will be dependent on the success of our other product candidates.\nWe obtained accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in December 2012, to sell our first new cancer medicine, Iclusig, for the treatment of adult patients with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that is resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy. When Iclusig was approved by the FDA, its United States prescribing information, or USPI, included a boxed warning concerning arterial thrombosis, hepatotoxicity and other precautions. We commenced sales and marketing of Iclusig in the United States in January 2013.\nIn October 2013, we suspended marketing and commercial distribution of Iclusig in the United States based on the FDA\u2019s concerns about updated safety data from the pivotal PACE trial of Iclusig. In addition, our clinical trials for Iclusig were placed on partial clinical hold and we discontinued our Phase 3 EPIC trial of Iclusig in adult patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase. In December 2013, the FDA approved revised USPI, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, and a revised box warning, allowing us to resume marketing and commercial distribution, which we commenced in January 2014. Iclusig is now indicated for adult patients with T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL, and chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated.\nIclusig has also been approved for marketing and commercial distribution in the European Union, and from late 2013 through 2014, was subject to review by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the benefits and risks of Iclusig to better understand the nature, frequency and severity of events obstructing the arteries or veins, the potential mechanism that leads to these side effects and whether there needed to be a revision in the dosing recommendation, patient monitoring and a risk management plan for Iclusig. This review was completed in January 2015, with additional warnings in the product information but without any change in the approved indications.\nPrior to the approval of Iclusig, we had not marketed a therapeutic product. Revenues from product sales were $45.2 million in 2013, $55.7 million in 2014 and $112.5 million in 2015. We expect that a majority of our total revenues in the next several years will be attributable to sales of Iclusig. We cannot be certain that Iclusig will be commercially successful. In addition to the other challenges related to a company launching its first commercial drug, we have faced the challenges of having Iclusig removed from the market in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2013 and re-launching the drug in the first quarter of 2014 with revised prescribing information that reduces the addressable patient population and an updated box warning. Moreover, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities could take additional actions in the future that could further reduce the commercial potential of Iclusig. We also face competition from other approved TKI therapies for CML or Ph+ ALL, which some view as having better risk/benefit profiles compared to Iclusig.\nIn 2015, we initiated a dose-ranging trial of Iclusig to provide important data regarding the efficacy and safety of Iclusig at doses lower than the currently approved dose, which may allow patients to minimize risk and optimize therapy. We also initiated a randomized Phase 3 trial of Iclusig vs. nilotinib in second line patients, which, if approved, would significantly expand the patient population eligible to receive Iclusig. These trials may not be successful, or even if successful, we might not receive the required regulatory approvals to permit us to market Iclusig for earlier lines of therapy, which would limit the drug\u2019s commercial potential.\nIf we do not achieve commercial success with Iclusig, our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer, and we will be dependent on the success of our other product candidates.\nThe commercial success of Iclusig depends on numerous factors, some of which are outside our control. If one or more of these factors negatively affects sales of Iclusig, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially harmed.\nOur future sales of Iclusig depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the changes required by the FDA in the USPI that reduced the addressable patient population and changes required by the EMA in the Iclusig SmPC following its review of the risks and benefits of Iclusig, along with any additional changes that may be required in the future;\n\u2022\nthe success of our efforts to obtain additional clinical data and secure regulatory approvals to market Iclusig in earlier lines of therapy than currently indicated;\n\u2022\nthe safety profile of Iclusig, including whether previously unknown side-effects or the increased incidence or severity of known side-effects are identified with the increased use of Iclusig, such as we announced in the fourth quarter of 2013;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other TKIs, which compete with Iclusig on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, cost, breadth of approved use and the safety and side-effect profile;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the availability of generic versions of imatinib on sales of Iclusig;\n\u2022\ncompetition from any additional products for the treatment of CML that are approved by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities in the future;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our commercial strategy for marketing Iclusig and our execution of that strategy, including our pricing strategy and the effectiveness of our efforts to obtain adequate third-party reimbursements;\n\u2022\nreceipt of regulatory approvals for Iclusig, and any applicable pricing and reimbursement approvals, in Europe, Japan and other countries or territories outside of the United States and the European Union;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of Iclusig by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, particularly following the temporary suspension of commercial distribution in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the updated prescribing information, including a revised boxed warning;\n\u2022\nresults from clinical trials and the receipt of regulatory approvals in any other indications that we may decide to pursue; and\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the demand for commercial supplies of Iclusig and to maintain and successfully monitor commercial manufacturing arrangements for Iclusig with third-party manufacturers to ensure they meet our standards and those of regulatory authorities.\nWhile we believe that Iclusig is an important medicine for patients with resistant or intolerant Philadelphia-positive leukemias, the net revenues that Iclusig may generate in future periods may change based upon the above factors, and could be lower than expected. If our revenues, market share and/or other indicators of market acceptance for Iclusig do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. In addition, if one or more of the factors above negatively affects sales of Iclusig, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain an effective and specialized sales force and marketing infrastructure, we will not be able to commercialize Iclusig successfully.\nIn order to successfully commercialize Iclusig, we have built a marketing organization and a specialized sales force for Iclusig in the United States and Europe. Factors that may hinder our ability to successfully market and commercially distribute Iclusig include:\n\u2022\ninability to maintain the relationship with the single specialty pharmacy with whom we have contracted for distribution of Iclusig in the United States and our other distributors, suppliers and manufacturers;\n\u2022\ninability of sales personnel to obtain access to or convince adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u2022\ninability to recruit, retain and effectively manage adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nlack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen delays, costs and expenses associated with maintaining our international capabilities, including our international sales and marketing organization and international supply chain and pricing and reimbursement capabilities.\nIf we are unable to maintain our sales force and marketing capability for Iclusig in the United States and in the European Union, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue, may generate increased expenses and may never become profitable.\nWe will need to continue to expend significant time and resources to train our Iclusig sales forces in the United States and the European Union to be credible, persuasive and compliant in discussing Iclusig with the specialists treating the patients indicated under the product\u2019s label. In addition, if we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate potential customers about the benefits and risks of Iclusig and its proper administration, our ability to successfully commercialize Iclusig could be diminished, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Iclusig and any of our product candidates are not accepted by patients, physicians and third-party payors, we will not be successful.\nOur success is dependent on the commercial acceptance of Iclusig and any of our other product candidates that may be approved. Iclusig and any other approved product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among patients, physicians or third-party payors, even if we have obtained necessary regulatory and any applicable pricing and reimbursement approvals. Physicians and health care payors may conclude that Iclusig or our product candidates are not as safe and/or effective as competing therapies or are not as attractive based on a cost and risk/benefit analysis as alternative treatments. For example, physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to request or take them for a variety of reasons, including lower demonstrated or perceived clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs; prevalence and severity of adverse events or other side effects; lack of cost-effectiveness; lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors; a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies that are believed to have significant advantages over our drugs and drug candidates; convenience and ease of administration; other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; or ineffective marketing and distribution support.\nWe believe that recommendations by physicians and acceptance by health care payors will be essential for market acceptance of Iclusig and our product candidates. If Iclusig fails to achieve market acceptance, or our product candidates are approved and fail to achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate revenues sufficient to be successful.\nCompeting drugs or technologies may render some or all of our products or future products noncompetitive or obsolete.\nMany well-known pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which have substantially greater capital, research and development capabilities and experience than us, are presently engaged in developing drug candidates focused on the same biological targets or the treatment of the same disease indications on which we are focused. Some of these entities already have competitive products on the market or product candidates in clinical trials or in more advanced preclinical studies than we do.\nFor example, Iclusig currently competes with existing therapies that are approved for the treatment of patients with CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapies, such as nilotinib marketed by Novartis, dasatinib marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, bosutinib marketed by Pfizer and omacetaxine mepesuccinate marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. At this time, based on the revised USPI for Iclusig approved by the FDA in December 2013, Iclusig may only be promoted for treatment of adult patients with T315I-positive CML and Ph+ ALL and patients for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated, which limits the addressable patient population and therefore revenues that can be generated from sales of the drug. In addition, a generic version of imatinib was launched in the United States in February 2016, and generic versions are expected to be launched in other markets. Although we currently believe that generic versions of imatinib will not materially impact our commercialization of Iclusig, given Iclusig\u2019s various indication statements globally that are currently focused on resistant or intolerant CML, we cannot be certain how physicians, payors, patients, regulatory authorities and other market participants will respond to the availability of generic versions of imatinib. If generic versions of imatinib have a greater impact on our commercialization of Iclusig than we currently anticipate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, Pfizer, Novartis and Roche/Chugai have launched ALK inhibitors that will compete with brigatinib should it gain marketing approval. Tesaro, Ignyta and Xcovery also have ALK inhibitors in development and Pfizer is developing a follow-on compound to its currently marketed product, crizotinib.\nCompeting drugs or technologies may render some or all of our products or future products noncompetitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to make the enhancements to our products necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging drug products. Competing products on the market or in development may also lead us and our collaborators to revise or cease development of our product candidates in one or more indications for commercial reasons, even where clinical data may be promising. If we are unable to successfully compete in our chosen markets, we will not become profitable.\nIn order to execute our business plan and achieve the full commercial potential of Iclusig, we will need to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize Iclusig in additional markets and in additional indications and lines of therapy. If we are not successful in these efforts, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nBased on sales of existing TKIs for the treatment of CML, we believe that there are commercial opportunities for the use of Iclusig globally in additional markets and in additional therapeutic indications and in additional lines of therapy, and we are pursuing these opportunities. In December 2014, we entered into a co-development and commercialization agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Otsuka, under which Otsuka has exclusive rights to commercialize Iclusig in Japan and nine other Asian countries and to fund future clinical trials in those countries. We filed for marketing approval in Japan in early 2016, and we expect a decision from Japanese regulatory authorities in the second half of 2016.\nWe and our distributors are currently selling Iclusig in Europe and various other countries throughout the world where we have received marketing authorization.\nIn addition, we are seeking to expand the commercial opportunity for Iclusig. In 2015, we initiated a dose-ranging trial of Iclusig to provide important data regarding the efficacy and safety of Iclusig at doses lower than\nthe currently approved dose, which may allow patients to minimize risk and optimize therapy. We also initiated a randomized Phase 3 trial of Iclusig vs. nilotinib in second-line patients, which, if approved, would significantly expand the patient population eligible to receive Iclusig. These trials may not be successful, or even if successful, we might not receive the required regulatory approvals to permit us to market Iclusig for earlier lines of therapy, which would limit the drug\u2019s commercial potential.\nIf we are not successful in obtaining regulatory approval of Iclusig in additional foreign countries and in additional indications and lines of therapy, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nWe may not succeed in developing, obtaining regulatory approval and generating product revenues from our product candidate brigatinib (AP26113) or any other product candidate, which would materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs with all scientific endeavors, we face much trial and error, and we and our collaborators may fail at numerous stages along the way, which could prevent us and our collaborators from successfully developing, obtaining approval for and marketing our product candidate brigatinib (AP26113) and any other product candidate. Factors that could affect the timing and the ability to obtain additional regulatory approvals and to achieve market acceptance and gain market share for brigatinib and any other product candidate include, among others:\n\u2022\nproduct formulation;\n\u2022\ndose and dosage regimen;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain timely and sufficient patient enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe risk of occurrence of adverse events and other side effects in patients participating in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe attainment of clinical data that is sufficient to support regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidates at commercially reasonable costs;\n\u2022\nthe ability to fund commercial development and to build or access a sales force in the marketplace for that product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully differentiate product candidates from competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain clearance or approval of companion diagnostic tests, if required, on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe ability to educate physicians and build awareness about our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to sell, market and distribute such product candidates.\nWe may not receive regulatory approvals within the timeframes we anticipate, or at all, and ultimately we may not succeed in developing or commercializing additional products which will generate revenues for our company. If we are not successful in developing our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing any approved products, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially harmed.\nIf we or our collaborators are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates that require such tests, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full commercial potential of these product candidates.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to develop either by ourselves or with collaborators in vitro companion diagnostic tests for brigatinib in front-line therapy and for AP32788 for the treatment of NSCLC patients with specific mutations in the EGFR or HER2 kinases. To be successful, we or our collaborators will need to address a number of scientific, technical, regulatory and logistical challenges. The FDA regulates in vitro companion diagnostics as medical devices that will likely be subject to clinical trials in conjunction with the clinical trials of our product candidates, and which will require regulatory clearance or approval prior to\ncommercialization. We expect to rely on third parties for the design, development and manufacture of companion diagnostic tests for our therapeutic product candidates that require such tests. If these parties are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for these therapeutic product candidates, or experience delays in doing so, the development of these therapeutic product candidates may be adversely affected, these therapeutic product candidates may not receive marketing approval, and we may not realize the full commercial potential of any of these therapeutics that receive marketing approval. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nPositive results from earlier stage clinical trials may not be replicated in later-stage clinical trials, increased adverse events or safety issues could arise, or regulatory authorities may conclude that clinical data from later-stage clinical trials are not sufficient to support approval or that data from post-approval clinical trials are not sufficient to support broader use of drugs after approval. Regulatory authorities may require changes in the permitted usage of any approved products.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials or following regulatory approval even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage development. Accordingly, the results to date from preclinical studies and clinical trials for Iclusig and brigatinib may not be predictive of the results to be obtained from ongoing or future clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may conclude that data generated from later-stage clinical trials are not sufficient to support approval, or that data obtained following approval may require changes to be made in the permitted usage of any approved products. For example, although we were able to obtain accelerated approval for Iclusig on the basis of data from our pivotal Phase 2 PACE trial without conducting a Phase 3 trial, and we believe that similar prospects for regulatory approval exist for brigatinib, we may be required to conduct more clinical trials for brigatinib than we currently anticipate. Moreover, we announced in October 2013 updated data from the PACE trial, in which it was observed that with a median follow up of 24 months, serious arterial thrombosis occurred in 11.8 percent of Iclusig-treated patients, compared to 8 percent after 11 months of follow-up reflected in the then-current USPI. Based on this and other follow-up data, we suspended marketing and commercial distribution of Iclusig in October 2013 and, following discussions with the FDA, we were permitted to resume in December 2013 with revised prescribing information and a revised boxed warning that reduces the addressable patient population for whom Iclusig is indicated.\nIf positive results from earlier stage trials are not replicated in later-stage trials, if increased adverse events or safety issues arise, if we or our collaborators are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those currently contemplated, or if the permitted usage of Iclusig or any of our other product candidates that are approved is constrained or withdrawn by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we or our collaborators may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain or maintain, marketing approval for these products, and we may lose the opportunity to generate product revenues or to earn additional development or regulatory milestones or royalties. Furthermore, potential competitive commercial factors and our resources may influence future decisions and directions by us or our collaborators on which clinical indications to pursue and when.\nRisks relating to our financial position and capital requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses to date and may never be profitable.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our formation in 1991, and had an accumulated deficit of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development of Iclusig and our product candidates, from our discovery research activities and from general and administrative costs, including costs incurred to prosecute and protect our intellectual property. In addition, we have incurred significant expenses in building a commercial organization to market, sell and distribute Iclusig and our other products upon potential regulatory approval in the United States, Europe and other select markets, worldwide. It is likely that we will incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we continue our research, development and commercialization activities. If our losses continue and we and our existing collaborators or\npotential future collaborators are unable to successfully develop, commercialize, manufacture and market Iclusig, brigatinib, ridaforolimus and any other product candidates and/or we are unable to enter into additional collaboration agreements or licenses for our intellectual property, we may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability. Even if we and our collaborators are able to commercialize products and we are able to enter into collaboration agreements or licenses in the future, we may never generate sufficient revenues to be profitable.\nInsufficient funding may jeopardize our research and development programs and may require us to reduce our operations or prevent commercialization of our products and technologies.\nWe have financed our operations and investments to date primarily through sales of our common stock and convertible notes in public and private offerings, through a royalty financing agreement, through the receipt of upfront and milestone payments from collaborations and licenses with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and, to a lesser extent, through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans, supplemented by the borrowing of long-term debt from commercial lenders. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs. We seek to balance the level of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms.\nWith sales of Iclusig in the United States from January through October 2013 and commencing again in January 2014, as well as sales in Europe since the second half of 2013, we have generated product revenues that have contributed to our cash flows. However, our cash flows generated from sales of Iclusig are not currently sufficient to fund operations and we will need to seek additional sources to fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $242.3 million. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2015, together with estimated sales of Iclusig, additional funding available under our royalty financing agreement and funding we could receive from new collaborative agreements, licenses, or strategic alliances, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. However, the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amount of future revenue generated by Iclusig, the potential introduction of one or more of our other drug candidates to the market, and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs. Changes to our operating plan or assumptions, economic factors or strategic opportunities or the unavailability of funding under our royalty financing agreement or from any new collaborative agreements, licenses, or strategic alliances, may require us to raise additional funds through one or more financings of equity or debt securities or other transactions.\nWe have from time to time accessed funding by issuing common stock or other securities in private placements or public offerings. We are currently a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d or WKSI, pursuant to rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which permits us to file registration statements for offerings of shares of our common stock and other securities that are effective upon filing. We may also from time to time seek additional funding from technology licensing, or the issuance of debt or other structured funding alternatives. However, such additional funding may not be available at all, or on terms acceptable to us.\nIf we are not able to secure additional funding if or when required to fund our operations including our research and development programs and commercialization activities at their current levels or at levels that may be required in the future, we may be required to reduce our operations or to delay, scale back, eliminate or terminate commercialization or further clinical development of Iclusig or clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates.\nWe are required to repay the funds provided to us under our royalty financing agreement with PDL Biopharma, Inc. (\u201cPDL\u201d) and we have granted PDL a security interest in certain assets relating to Iclusig to secure our obligations under the agreement. The repayment of this funding or PDL\u2019s exercise of its rights under the security agreement could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn July 2015, we entered into a Revenue Interest Assignment Agreement with PDL, or the royalty financing agreement, under which PDL agreed to pay us $100 million for the right to receive a percentage of global net revenues of Iclusig equal to 2.5 percent during the first year of the agreement, 5.0 percent after the first year through the end of 2018 (subject to agreed-upon annual maximum payments through 2018), and 6.5 percent from 2019 until it receives a 10 percent internal rate of return. In addition, we have the option to require PDL to fund up to an additional $100 million in one or two tranches between the six-month and twelve-month anniversary of the agreement, and the 6.5 percent royalty rate would increase to 7.5 percent if we draw down more than $150 million.\nBeginning in 2019, if PDL receives royalty payments that are less than the applicable percentage multiplied by specified projected annual sales of Iclusig, then it will also have the right to receive the applicable percentage of worldwide net revenues of brigatinib (subject to its approval by regulatory authorities), up to the amount of the revenue interest shortfall for the applicable year. In addition, if, after five years from each payment tranche, PDL has not received total payments under the royalty financing agreement that are at least equal to the total amounts it paid to us, then we will be required to pay PDL an amount equal to each such shortfall. In connection with the royalty financing agreement, we granted PDL a security interest in certain assets relating to Iclusig, including all of our revenues from sales of Iclusig covered by the royalty financing agreement, certain segregated deposit accounts established under the royalty financing agreement, and certain intellectual property, license agreements, and regulatory approvals related to Iclusig, in order to secure our obligations under the royalty financing agreement, including our obligation to pay all amounts due thereunder.\nIf sales of Iclusig and, if approved, brigatinib, are not sufficient to fund the minimum royalty requirements under the royalty financing agreement, we will be required to repay the shortfall to PDL, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to repay this shortfall, then PDL could seek to enforce its rights under the security agreement that we entered into in connection with the royalty financing agreement, which would have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited in the future if we do not have sufficient taxable income or due to ownership changes that have occurred or may occur in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $661.0 million in the United States and $266.0 million in foreign territories and U.S. federal research tax credits of $32.3 million, which could be used in certain circumstances to offset our future taxable income or otherwise payable taxes and therefore reduce our federal and state income tax liabilities. Based on current income tax rates, if fully utilized, our NOLs and other carryforwards could provide a benefit to us of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits in future years will depend upon our ability to comply with the rules relating to the preservation and use of NOLs and the amount of our otherwise taxable income. If we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, we will lose the benefit of these NOLs permanently. Consequently, our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our NOLs will depend significantly on our success in generating income from Iclusig and any other product candidates that may be approved.\nAdditionally, if we undergo an ownership change, the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limit on the amount of the taxable income that may be offset by our NOLs generated prior to the ownership change, and we may be unable to use a significant portion or all of our NOLs to offset taxable income.\nOur common stock is very actively traded on a daily basis. As a result of high trading volume, there may be a shift of ownership among certain of our stockholders that could result in an ownership change, which could limit our ability to utilize our NOL and tax credit carryforwards under applicable section of the Internal Revenue Code. Limitations imposed on the ability to use NOLs and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than would otherwise be required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs and tax credits. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nWe may seek to raise the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and collaboration and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights or, in the case of debt securities, require us to pay interest that would reduce our cash flows from operations or comply with certain covenants that could restrict our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nForecasting sales of Iclusig may be difficult and revenue recognition may be deferred. If our revenue projections are inaccurate or revenue is deferred, our business may be harmed and our future prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur sales of Iclusig can be difficult to forecast. Factors that can increase the difficulty of forecasting sales of Iclusig include the following:\n\u2022\ncautionary prescribing behavior, confusion or other concerns regarding the safety and risk-benefit of Iclusig;\n\u2022\ndecisions that may be made by physicians regarding dosing of patients with Iclusig in response to safety concerns or adverse events;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in identifying appropriate patients for treatment with Iclusig;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of reimbursement for the product;\n\u2022\ntreatment guidelines issued by government and non-government agencies;\n\u2022\ntypes of cancer for which the product is approved;\n\u2022\ntiming of market entry relative to competitive products;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative therapies;\n\u2022\nprice of our product relative to alternative therapies, including generic versions of our product, or generic versions of innovative products that compete with our product;\n\u2022\npatients\u2019 reliance on patient assistance programs, under which we provide free drug;\n\u2022\nrates of returns and rebates;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of launch trajectory;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture and deliver Iclusig in commercially sufficient quantities;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our single specialty pharmacy distributor in the United States and our distributors in other markets to process orders in a timely manner and satisfy their other obligations to us;\n\u2022\nthe extent of marketing efforts by us and any third-party agents retained by us; and\n\u2022\nside effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or similar products.\nThe extent to which any of these or other factors individually or in the aggregate may impact future sales of Iclusig is uncertain and difficult to predict. Our management must make forecasting decisions regarding future revenue in the course of business planning despite this uncertainty, and actual results of operations may deviate materially from projected results. This may lead to inefficiencies and increased difficulties in operational planning. If our revenues from Iclusig sales are lower than we anticipate or revenue is\ndeferred, we will incur costs in the short term that will result in losses that are unavoidable. A shortfall in our revenue would have a direct impact on our cash flow and on our business generally. In addition, fluctuations in our quarterly results can adversely and significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur financial results are impacted by management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Significant estimates that may be made by us include assumptions used in the determination of revenue recognition, accrued product development expenses, inventory, leased buildings under construction and stock-based compensation. Although we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, our interpretation of existing accounting literature and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, if our assumptions prove to be materially incorrect, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nRisks relating to our reliance on third parties\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers, including sole source suppliers, to manufacture Iclusig, brigatinib and our other product candidates and the materials we require for clinical and commercial use. We may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.\nWe rely on a network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture and supply Iclusig for commercial sale and ongoing clinical trials, and brigatinib and our other drug candidates for clinical trials and any commercial sales if they are approved. As a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including sole source suppliers of certain components of Iclusig, brigatinib and our other product candidates, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions. Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step endeavor. Third-party contract manufacturers supply us with raw materials, and contract manufacturers convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form. Establishing and managing this supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. Although we attempt to effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations.\nWe require a supply of Iclusig for sale in the United States, Europe and other markets where it is approved. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on sole source third-party manufacturers to produce starting materials, drug substance, and final drug product, and to package and label Iclusig, brigatinib and our other product candidates, if approved, until we enter into arrangements with additional or alternative suppliers. While\nwe have identified and expect to qualify and engage back-up third-party manufacturers as additional or alternative suppliers for the commercial supply of Iclusig and brigatinib, we currently do not have such arrangements in place. Moreover, some of these alternative manufacturers will have to be approved by the FDA before we can use them for manufacturing of Iclusig and brigatinib. It is also possible that supplies of materials that cannot be second-sourced can be managed with inventory planning. There can be no assurance, however, that failure of any of our original sole source third party manufacturers to meet our commercial demands for our approved drug products in a timely manner, or our failure to engage qualified additional or back-up suppliers for the commercial supply of our approved products, would not have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts and our business.\nSupply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. Any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of Iclusig and/or the timing of our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we may be required to modify our production methods to permit us to economically manufacture our drugs for sale and our drug candidates for clinical trials. These modifications may require us to re-evaluate our resources and the resources of our third-party manufacturers, which could result in abrupt changes in our production methods and supplies.\nIn the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have Iclusig or our drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.\nThe failure of our third party manufacturers to meet our commercial demands for Iclusig and brigatinib in a timely manner, or our failure to engage qualified additional or back-up suppliers for the commercial supply of these products, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on a single specialty pharmacy for distribution of Iclusig in the United States, and the loss of that specialty pharmacy or its failure to distribute Iclusig effectively would adversely affect sales of Iclusig.\nWe rely on a single specialty pharmacy for distribution of Iclusig in the United States. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions, which often require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. The use of specialty pharmacies involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these specialty pharmacies will:\n\u2022\nnot provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our products or complaints about our products;\n\u2022\nreduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support our products;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nIn addition, our agreement with the specialty pharmacy may be terminated by either party on 30 days\u2019 notice. If our single specialty pharmacy does not fulfill its contractual obligations to us, or refuses or fails to adequately serve patients, or the agreement is terminated without adequate notice, shipments of Iclusig, and associated revenues, would be adversely affected. In addition, we expect that it may take a significant amount of time if we were required to change our specialty pharmacy.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for brigatinib, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to successfully market and sell the drug candidate, even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval.\nIn order to market brigatinib, if it is approved, we will need to expand our marketing organization and hire a specialized sales force, which requires substantial efforts and significant management and financial resources. While we intend to stage our commitments to the extent possible in consideration of the development timelines, in order to support an effective launch of brigatinib, we will need to make significant financial commitments to our marketing organization prior to receiving regulatory approval. We will need to devote significant effort, in particular, to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products such as brigatinib. Competition for personnel with these skills is very high and we will be competing with companies that are currently marketing approved, successful drugs. Accordingly, we may be unable to successfully, directly or indirectly, sell brigatinib, even if it is approved for sale. If we are unable to effectively sell brigatinib, our ability to generate revenues will be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to hire, in a timely manner, the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need, if at all. In addition, we may not be able to enter into any marketing or distribution agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we cannot establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities as we intend, either by developing our own capabilities or entering into agreements with third parties, sales of brigatinib, if any, may be harmed.\nWe have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and are dependent upon the ability of third parties, including contract research organizations, collaborative academic groups, clinical trial sites and investigators, to conduct or to assist us in conducting clinical trials for our product candidates.\nNotwithstanding our successful development of Iclusig to date, we have limited experience compared to many other biopharmaceutical companies in designing, initiating, conducting and monitoring the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates. We are currently conducting clinical trials of Iclusig and brigatinib and plan to commence a clinical trial of AP32788. We are dependent upon our ability and/or the ability of our collaborators, licensees, contract research organizations, clinical trial sites and investigators to successfully design, initiate, conduct and monitor clinical trials. Failure by us or any of these parties to timely and effectively initiate, conduct and monitor our clinical trials could significantly delay or materially impair our ability to complete clinical trials and/or obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and, consequently, could delay or materially impair our ability to generate revenues from them.\nWe also intend to utilize companion diagnostics in our planned clinical trials of brigatinib as a potential front-line therapy and AP32788 in order to preselect patients who will receive specified treatment regimens. We will rely on collaborators to test patient samples in connection with such companion diagnostics, perform any required clinical trials and obtain regulatory clearance or approval. Any failure on the part of these parties to properly perform such testing and clinical trials could jeopardize clinical trials and delay or prevent the approval of our associated therapeutic candidate.\nIf any collaborator or licensee terminates its agreement with us or fails to perform its obligations under its agreement with us, or fails to comply with applicable law, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated.\nOur current or future collaborations and licenses may not result in product candidates that are scientifically or commercially successful or result in the development or commercialization of any product candidates. In addition, disputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology or product candidates developed with collaborators and licensees, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize any affected product candidate.\nOur current collaboration and license agreements allow, and we expect that any future collaborations and licenses will allow, either party to terminate the agreement for specified material breaches by the other party. If a collaborator or licensee terminates its agreement with us, for breach or otherwise, it may be difficult for us to attract new collaborators or licensees and could adversely affect how we are perceived in the business and financial communities. In addition, a collaborator or licensee could determine that it is in its financial interest to:\n\u2022\npursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products, either on its own or jointly with others, that may be competitive with the products on which it is collaborating with us or has licensed from us, which could affect its commitment to us;\n\u2022\npursue higher-priority programs or change the focus of its development programs, which could affect the collaborator\u2019s or licensee\u2019s commitment to us; or\n\u2022\nchoose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our product candidates, if any are approved for marketing, than it does for product candidates of its own development.\nIf any of these events occur, the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such development and commercialization on our own.\nRisks relating to our intellectual property\nIf our patents do not protect Iclusig, brigatinib or our other product candidates, our exclusive commercial rights in the product or product candidate could be compromised, and if any of our approved drugs or product candidates infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation and substantial liabilities.\nWe have numerous issued patents and patent applications pending in the United States, as well as counterparts in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and maintain United States and foreign patent protection for Iclusig and our product candidates, their manufacture and uses; to preserve our trade secrets; and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In particular, we believe that composition-of-matter claims are the most significant patent claims for companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry that focus on small molecule drug candidates that are new chemical compounds. While we have patents or patent applications with composition-of-matter claims for Iclusig and each of our product candidates, only a portion of these patents have been granted to date. We cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be valuable commercially.\nDue to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to maintain, obtain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. U.S. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office. Similarly, publication of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries. Consequently, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications covering Iclusig, our product candidates or their manufacture or use.\nThird parties, including a number of our competitors, have developed competing and/or complementary technologies upon which patent applications have been filed and patents have been granted. These third-party technologies concern in part compounds, compositions, methods of use and production of such compounds and compositions, targets, genes and gene mutations, and the use of such targets, genes and gene mutations to identify drug candidates and develop companion diagnostic methods and corresponding kits. Third-party intellectual property protecting such technologies that are related to our business may cover or conflict with our patent applications, technologies or product candidates as well as those of complementary businesses which our business relies upon. Such conflicts could limit the scope of the patents that we may be able to obtain or may result in the denial of our patent applications. If a third party were to obtain intellectual property protection for any of the foregoing, we may be required to challenge such protection, terminate or modify our programs\nimpacted by such protection or obtain licenses from such third parties, which might not be available on acceptable terms. Also, if a third party were to introduce a product into the market which we believe infringes our patents, we may be required to enforce our patent rights or seek to obtain an injunction or other relief, which could be time-consuming and expensive.\nOur patents may be challenged by third parties, in connection with a third party\u2019s Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or otherwise, resulting in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, which could compromise the scope or duration of our exclusive rights in the relevant product. An ANDA can be filed as early as four years after FDA approval of a drug. Other challenges to a patent may be mounted without regard to the date of an FDA approval. Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. Our patents as issued or as subsequently limited by any litigation might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from circumventing our patent protection and utilizing our technologies. For instance, the issued patents relating to Iclusig and our product candidates may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property.\nThe laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and other companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed.\nBecause of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a drug candidate, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of our drug candidates, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. To the extent our approved drugs or drug candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such approved drugs or drug candidates, those drugs and drug candidates would not be protected by patents, and we would then need to rely solely on other types of exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and other types of regulatory exclusivity available under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to them, such as our employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also have entered into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and our consultants. Any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nRisks relating to our operations\nIf we fail to manage the size of our workforce and other resources effectively, our business may suffer.\nThe size of our workforce has varied significantly in recent years. We built out our commercial organization in advance of the initial launch of our first cancer medicine, Iclusig, in 2013, then reduced our workforce in late\n2013 when sales of Iclusig were temporarily suspended in the United States, and then increased our workforce again with the re-launch of Iclusig in the United States in 2014. In 2016, we plan to expand our sales, marketing and other personnel to support the marketing and commercialization of brigatinib, if it is approved.\nWe have entered into a lease for approximately 386,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in two adjacent connected buildings at 75 - 125 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with an initial term of 15 years and options to renew for three terms of five years each. We had planned to relocate our corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities into this space in early 2015, but construction was delayed and we do not expect to take occupancy until the third quarter of 2016. Based on the terms of the lease, as amended, we commenced making lease payments in March 2015. In addition, in August 2015, we entered into an agreement to sublease approximately 160,000 square feet of the total leased space at 75-125 Binney Street to a third party, with commencement expected in the third quarter of 2016. We also lease approximately 100,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at 26 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts through July 2019, and an additional 26,000 square feet of office space at a nearby building. We are currently paying rent on these buildings and the new Binney Street facility while it is under construction. Although we plan to sublease or terminate the leases for our existing facilities when we are ready to move into the Binney Street facility, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner or at all, which would increase our expenses more than currently anticipated.\nIn addition, because our drug discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. We need to attract and retain employees with experience in these fields. We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors, our collaborators and other companies throughout our industry. The growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Cambridge, Massachusetts area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in the Cambridge area makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country to these areas.\nWe must respond effectively to these demands and manage our internal organization and our facilities to accommodate our anticipated needs and to respond to any unexpected developments. If we are unable to manage the size of our workforce, our facilities and our other resources effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action and product liability litigation and we have been and may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock declined significantly following our October 2013 announcements concerning the safety, marketing and commercial distribution and further clinical development of Iclusig in the United States. Class action lawsuits were subsequently filed in October and December 2013 alleging, among other things, that we and certain of our officers violated federal securities laws by making allegedly material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact regarding clinical and safety data for Iclusig in our public disclosures. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees.\nIn addition, in November and December 2013, purported derivative lawsuits were filed alleging that our directors and certain of our officers breached their fiduciary duties related to the clinical development and commercialization of Iclusig and by making misrepresentations regarding the safety and commercial marketability of Iclusig. The lawsuits also asserted claims for unjust enrichment and corporate waste, and for misappropriation of information and insider trading by the officers named as defendants. The plaintiffs sought unspecified monetary damages, changes in our corporate governance policies and internal procedures, restitution and disgorgement from the individually named defendants, and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees. In March 2015, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss these derivative lawsuits, and the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was subsequently dismissed.\nFurthermore, in March 2015, a product liability lawsuit was filed alleging that our cancer medicine Iclusig was defective, dangerous and lacked adequate warnings when the plaintiff used it from July to August 2013. The plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages, punitive damages and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees.\nWhile we believe we have meritorious defenses in all of the currently pending matters, we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits. Monitoring and defending against legal actions, whether or not meritorious, is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities, and we cannot predict how long it may take to resolve these matters.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation. Although we have insurance, coverage could be denied or prove to be insufficient. We are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from the currently pending lawsuits, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these matters or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to these lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the uncertainty of the currently pending lawsuits could lead to more volatility in our stock price.\nOur business has a substantial risk of product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of insurance, product liability claims, including the currently pending product liability litigation against us, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. Prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market our products, we or our collaborators are required to test such products in human clinical trials at health care institutions pursuant to agreements which indemnify such institutions in case of harm caused to patients by our products. We may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure resulting from use of our products during clinical testing or commercialization.\nProduct liability lawsuits that are brought against us for injuries or deaths allegedly due to patients\u2019 adverse reactions to Iclusig and any other approved products, including the currently pending product liability litigation, may subject us to liability. Product liability lawsuits can require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the outcome, product liability claims may also result in injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, significant costs, diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, substantial monetary awards, loss of revenue, and additional distractions from our efforts to market and commercialize Iclusig. Although we have product liability insurance, coverage could be denied or prove to be insufficient. Also, we may not be able to renew or retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against product liability claims, which could also impact the marketing and commercial distribution of Iclusig and the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have operations in Europe in order to market Iclusig internationally. In addition, we have distribution, manufacturing, collaborative and clinical trial relationships outside the United States. Consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\ncompliance with country-specific regulations limiting the use of individuals\u2019 personal information and restricting the transfer of this information to the United States;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under United States law. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits United States companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We are also subject to import and export control laws. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding adverse publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.\nThe loss of key members of our scientific and management staff could delay and may prevent the achievement of our research, development and business objectives.\nWe are substantially dependent on our senior management team and other employees responsible for areas such as drug development, clinical trials, regulatory affairs, drug discovery, manufacturing, commercial operations, business development and intellectual property protection and licensing. A loss of key personnel or a failure to properly integrate new personnel could be disruptive. While we have entered into employment agreements with all of our executive officers, these officers may terminate their employment with us at any time. The value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time, such as options and restricted stock units, will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control, and may at any point in time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. The loss of, and failure to promptly replace, any member of our senior management team could significantly delay and may prevent the achievement of our research, development and business objectives.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development efforts involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and\nworkplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate any of these laws or regulations.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data (including personal health information and other personal data) and other disruptions of our or our vendors\u2019 information systems could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems and outsourced vendors. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information. Because information systems, networks and other technologies are critical to many of our operating activities, shutdowns or service disruptions at our company or vendors that provide information systems, networks, or other services to us pose increasing risks. Such disruptions may be caused by events such as computer hacking, phishing attacks, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our business, including loss of data and damage to equipment and data. In addition, system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation or a loss of revenues. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for any losses associated with such events.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company and our vendors, including personal information of our employees and patients, and company and vendor confidential data. In addition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our vendors or fraudulently induce our employees or employees of our vendors to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data. Like other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, and other cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of our security or that of our vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose business and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. In addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by patients and groups in private litigation involving privacy issues related to data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations, including claims for misuse or inappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. As we outsource more of our information systems to vendors, engage in more electronic transactions with payors and patients, and rely more on cloud-based information systems, the related security risks will increase and we will need to expend additional resources to protect our technology and information systems.\nRisks relating to regulatory approvals, pricing and reimbursement\nThe manufacture, distribution and sale of Iclusig and our product candidates are subject to significant regulatory oversight and restrictions. Regulatory authorities may require the use of a risk mitigation strategy, such as the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) required by the FDA for Iclusig. These restrictions and requirements subject us to increased risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Iclusig.\nIn connection with the approval to resume marketing and commercial distribution of Iclusig in the United States in December 2013, the FDA required us to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. The objective of the REMS program is to inform prescribers of the risk of vascular occlusion associated with Iclusig and of the revised USPI. The REMS program includes letters to physicians and professional societies, a fact sheet and information that will be communicated through professional journals and displayed at scientific meetings. In addition, we are fulfilling a series of post-marketing requirements to better understand the risks of vascular occlusion and to further explore various doses of Iclusig, including enhanced assessment and prospective observation of patients with vascular occlusive events, continued follow-up monitoring of patients from our Iclusig trials, and a randomized multi-arm trial to characterize a range of Iclusig doses and safe use.\nAny REMS required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies may lead to increased costs to assure compliance with new post-approval regulatory requirements and potential requirements or restrictions on the sale of our approved drugs, all of which could lead to lower sales volume and revenue. As required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, the information that we collect while implementing our REMS could result in further required changes to the label and prescribing information of our approved products or require us to take other actions that could have an adverse effect on a product\u2019s commercial success, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClinical trials for our product candidates are expensive and time consuming, may take longer than we expect or may not be completed at all, and their outcome is uncertain.\nWe and our collaborators are currently conducting multiple clinical trials for our clinical product candidates, and we and our collaborators expect to commence additional trials of Iclusig and our product candidates in the future. Each of our clinical trials requires the investment of substantial expense and time and the timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of these clinical trials may be subject to significant delays attributable to various causes, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, failure of patients to complete the clinical trial, delay in or failure to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, shortages of available drug supply, or the imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies, such as the partial clinical hold the FDA imposed on additional patient enrollment in all clinical trials of Iclusig in October 2013. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the target patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative established or investigational treatments.\nWe depend on medical institutions and clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our clinical trials in compliance with FDA and other applicable requirements and guidelines, often referred to as Good Clinical Practices, and to the extent they fail to enroll patients for our clinical trials, are delayed for a significant time in achieving full enrollment, or fail to follow proper procedures, we may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both, which may harm our business. In addition, we conduct clinical trials in foreign countries which may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased drug shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the need to engage foreign CROs, as well as expose us to risks associated with less experienced clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA, different standards of medical care, and fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices and are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are\nconducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions. We, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign governmental agencies could delay, suspend or halt our clinical trials of a product candidate for numerous reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trial, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects, including fatalities, or a determination may be made that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks, such as was reflected in our announcement in October 2013 that the FDA had imposed a partial clinical hold on all clinical trials for Iclusig following our review of additional clinical data from the PACE trial showing that a higher percentage of patients taking Iclusig had experienced serious arterial thrombosis and serious venous occlusion after a median of 24 months of follow-up;\n\u2022\nthe time required to determine whether the product candidate is effective may be longer than expected;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may not be more effective than current therapies;\n\u2022\nthe quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards;\n\u2022\nour inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of the product candidate to complete the trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and enroll patients to participate in clinical trials for reasons including competition from other clinical trial programs for the same or similar indications; or\n\u2022\nour inability to retain patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues, or who are lost to further follow-up.\nIn addition, clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events, including patient fatalities that may be attributable to our product candidates, during a clinical trial could cause it to be redone or terminated. Further, some of our clinical trials may be overseen by an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, and a DMC may recommend a delay or suspension in one or more of these trials due to safety or futility findings based on events occurring during a clinical trial.\nIf clinical trials of any of our product candidates fail, we or our collaborators may not be able to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate that is the subject of the failed clinical trials. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies could also require additional clinical trials before or after granting of marketing approval for any products, which could result in increased costs and significant delays in the development and commercialization of such products and could result in the withdrawal of such products from the market after initially obtaining marketing approval. Our failure, or the failure of our collaborators, to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in clinical development could delay or prevent obtaining marketing approval of the product candidate and, after obtaining marketing approval, data from post-approval studies could result in the product being withdrawn from the market, either of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIclusig and each of our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval. If we or our collaborators or contractors fail to comply with applicable regulations, we or they may be subject to enforcement action that could adversely affect us.\nWe and our collaborators and contractors will continue to be subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities even after our product candidates are approved. We and our collaborators and\ncontractors will continue to be subject to FDA requirements governing, among other things, the manufacture, packaging, sale, promotion, adverse event reporting, storage and recordkeeping of our approved products. For example, in October 2013, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on all clinical trials of Iclusig and, at the request of the FDA, we suspended marketing and commercial distribution of Iclusig in the United States following our review of additional clinical data from the pivotal PACE trial of Iclusig. The FDA has also issued Drug Safety Communications concerning Iclusig and revised the approved indications and prescribing information for Iclusig and the EMA has required additional safety warnings.\nIf we or any of our collaborators fails to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other U.S. or foreign governmental or regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our products or operations or previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we or our collaborator could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including warning letters; civil or criminal penalties; fines; injunctions; product seizures or detentions; import bans; voluntary or mandatory product recalls; suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; total or partial suspension of production; and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications.\nWe rely on third-party contractors for numerous services, and if those contractors fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, which affects our regulatory compliance, we could be adversely affected. For example, during 2014 we conducted a routine quality control audit of a third-party vendor and learned that this vendor did not meet its obligations to report to us all of the adverse events which its employees had become aware of while it performed patient support services for Iclusig during 2013. In response, we initiated a corrective action plan with the vendor, we informed the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities, and we accelerated quality control audits of all third-party contractors providing patient support services for us in the United States and Europe. While we believe that we have adequately addressed this particular matter, it is possible that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may take or require us to take additional actions in connection with this case, or in the future, that could be costly or time-consuming and/or adversely affect our commercialization of Iclusig.\nWe may not be able to obtain government regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nOther than Iclusig, none of our product candidates has been approved for commercialization in any country. Prior to commercialization, each product candidate will be subject to an extensive and lengthy review process in the United States and in other countries. We or our collaborators may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates, or even if approval is obtained, the labeling for such products may place restrictions on their use that could materially impact the marketability and profitability of those products. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements, which includes satisfying the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities that the product is both safe and effective for its intended uses, typically takes several years or more depending upon the type, complexity, novelty and safety profile of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Uncertainty with respect to meeting the regulatory requirements governing our product candidates may result in excessive costs or extensive delays in the regulatory review process.\nIf we pursue development of companion diagnostic tests to identify patients who are likely to benefit from our therapeutic product candidates, the failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals for the diagnostic test may prevent or delay approval of the therapeutic product. Moreover, the commercial success of any of our product candidates that require a companion diagnostic will be tied to the receipt of any required regulatory clearances or approvals and the continued availability of such tests.\nIn connection with our clinical development of brigatinib as a potential front-line therapy for patients with ALK+ NSCLC and AP32788 for the treatment of NSCLC patients with specific mutations in the EGFR or HER2 kinases, we plan to work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies. We expect to rely on third parties for the development, testing and manufacturing of these companion diagnostics, the application for and receipt of any required regulatory clearances or approvals, and the commercial supply of these companion diagnostics. Our third party collaborators may fail to obtain the required regulatory clearances or approvals, which could prevent or delay\napproval of our drug candidates. In addition, the commercial success of any of our product candidates that require a companion diagnostic will be tied to and dependent upon the receipt of required regulatory clearances or approvals and the continued ability of such third parties to make the companion diagnostic commercially available to us on reasonable terms in the relevant geographies.\nWe will not be able to sell our product candidates if we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with current good manufacturing practice requirements.\nBefore approving any of our product candidates, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities at which the drug product is manufactured and will not approve the drug candidate unless it is satisfied with our or our third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with cGMPs. The manufacturing of our product candidates must comply with cGMP requirements of the FDA and similar requirements of regulatory agencies in other countries. These requirements govern, among other things, manufacturing, quality control and documentation procedures. We, or any third-party manufacturer of our product candidates, may not be able to comply with these requirements, which would prevent us from obtaining approval for commercialization of our products. Material changes to the manufacturing processes or a change in manufacturer of products after approvals have been granted are also subject to review and approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Following approval, such facilities are subject to continuing FDA and foreign regulatory requirements including inspections and failure to comply with cGMPs or similar regulations could result in regulatory action including market withdrawals and recalls.\nGovernment and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. If they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, and private health insurers. Governments and other third-party payors continually try to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA, requires discounts under the Medicare drug benefit program and increases the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies on drugs covered by Medicaid. In addition, the ACA imposes an annual fee, which will increase annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. The financial impact of these discounts, increased rebates and fees and the other provisions of the ACA on our business is unclear, and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially harmed by future implementation of the ACA.\nIn addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs. As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. We may have to conduct post-marketing or competitive effectiveness studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of Iclusig or any other of our future drugs to such payors\u2019 satisfaction.\nSuch studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management\u2019s time and financial and other resources. Our products might not ultimately be proven to be cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\nReimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that already are reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services, and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in Medicare or Medicaid data used to calculate these rates. Net prices for products are often reduced by mandatory\ndiscounts or rebates required by government health care programs or by privately-negotiated discounts. Moreover, the United States federal government, state governments and private payors frequently pursue actions against pharmaceutical companies alleging that the companies have overstated prices in order to inflate reimbursement rates. Any such action could adversely affect the pricing of and the commercial success of our products.\nAny legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries also could reduce the net price we receive for our products.\nIf we market any of our products in a manner that violates federal or state health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, such as the federal False Claims Act and the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other similar state and federal laws and regulations. While we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws our business could be materially harmed.\nThe federal anti-kickback law prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The federal statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand, and therefore constrains our marketing practices and our various service arrangements with physicians, including physicians who make clinical decisions to use our products. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration and that can be construed as inducements for prescribing, purchasing, or recommending our products may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, known as \u201coff-label\u201d uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated \u201cbest price\u201d information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.\nAlthough physicians are permitted to, based on their medical judgment, prescribe products for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. We market Iclusig for the treatment of adult patients with T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL and chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated, and provide promotional materials to physicians regarding the use of Iclusig in these patient populations. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It also is possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under\nother statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nAlso applicable to some of our practices is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nThe majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. In addition, certain states have laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information and personal data, which may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA and are rapidly evolving, complicating compliance efforts. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs and criminal fines. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business.\nIn recent years, several states and localities, including California, the District of Columbia, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Vermont and West Virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider, or HCP payments and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states. Additionally, as part of the ACA, the federal government has enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions, which require pharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals beginning in March 2014. Many of these requirements are new and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements will be significant. If we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity.\nThe ACA also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nThe sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government agencies, and we believe that this trend will continue. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nFuture health care reform measures could hinder or prevent commercial success of our drugs and drug candidates.\nThe U.S. federal government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing health care reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely affect the pricing of health care products, including Iclusig and/or any future product candidates approved for sale. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors for health care products to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices we believe are fair for Iclusig or any drugs we may develop and commercialize.\nNew laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, relating to health care availability, methods of delivery or payment for drugs, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenues, and we may need to revise our research and development or commercialization programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging for any of several reasons, including policies advanced by the U.S. government, new health care legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell products. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for our current or future products, which would adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. As discussed above, the ACA may have far reaching consequences for companies like us. As a result of this new legislation, substantial changes could be made to the current system for paying for health care in the United States, including changes made in order to extend medical benefits to those who currently lack health insurance coverage. Extending coverage to a large population could substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursement. If reimbursement for our products is substantially less than we expect in the future, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther federal and state proposals and health care reforms in and outside of the United States could limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may further limit our commercial opportunity. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the ACA, by the Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of such current or future legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.\nRisks relating to our convertible senior notes and related hedge transactions\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes. The indebtedness created by the sale of the notes and any future indebtedness we incur expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn June 2014, we completed an offering of $200 million of 3.625 percent convertible senior notes due 2019, or the Notes. As a result of the issuance of the Notes, we incurred $200 million principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity on June 15, 2019, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture). There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, this indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult for us to pay other obligations;\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.\nConversion of the Notes may affect the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion. Holders of the outstanding Notes will be able to convert them only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2018. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. Any sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such notes could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above; and we may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any future indebtedness we may incur.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any debt instruments that we enter into in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, regulatory, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any future indebtedness we may incur, as well as to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying our research, development or commercialization efforts, investments or capital expenditures, selling or licensing assets, refinancing or obtaining additional debt or equity financing on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\nIn addition, agreements that govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our debt.\nWe may not be able to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes or to pay any cash payable on\nfuture conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture governing the Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes. A default under the indenture governing the Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions of the Notes.\nThe Notes contain a conditional conversion feature, which, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Notes contain a conditional conversion feature. If such feature is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with our issuance of the Notes may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with our offering of the Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with a financial institution, or the hedge counterparty. We entered into this convertible note hedge transaction with the expectation that it will reduce the potential dilution to our common stock and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Notes. In the event that the hedge counterparty fails to deliver shares to us or potential cash payments, as the case may be, as required under the convertible note hedge document, we would not receive the benefit of such transaction. Separately, we also entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty. The warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured over the valuation period at the maturity of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nIn connection with hedging this transaction, the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and may enter into, or may unwind, various derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of Notes (and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to any conversion of the Notes). These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in, or could have a negative effect on, the value of our common stock.\nIn addition, we intend to exercise options under the convertible note hedge transaction whenever the Notes are converted. Depending upon the method we elect to exercise such options, in order to unwind its hedge position with respect to the options we exercise, the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates may sell shares of our common stock or other securities in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock or the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Notes. The derivative transactions that the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates expect to enter into to hedge this transaction may include cash-settled equity swaps referenced to our common stock. In certain circumstances, the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates may have derivative positions that, when combined with the hedge counterparty\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 ownership of our common stock, if any, would give them economic exposure to the return on a significant number of shares of our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d). Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which adversely affects our reported and future financial results. The trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes may also be adversely affected.\nIn addition, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are, where the issuer has the intent to settle such instruments partly in a cash amount equal to the principal amount, currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected. We expect to use the \u201cif converted\u201d method to compute earnings per share, which could be more dilutive than using the \u201ctreasury stock\u201d method.\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us and, therefore, the ability of holders to exercise their rights associated with a fundamental change.\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change, holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Notes in cash. In addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Accordingly, our obligations under the Notes and the indenture as well as provisions of our organizational documents and other agreements could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nRisks relating to our common stock\nResults of our operations, new clinical and safety data, FDA and other regulatory actions, general market conditions for biotechnology stocks and other factors could result in a sudden change in the value of our stock.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, we continue to experience significant volatility in the price of our common stock. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our stock price ranged from a high of $10.07 per share to a low of $5.55 per share. In connection with our October 2013 announcements concerning the safety, marketing and commercial distribution and further clinical development of Iclusig in the United States, our stock price\ndeclined by 87 percent, from a closing price of $17.14 per share on the day before the first announcements to a low of $2.15 per share following the announcements. Some of the many factors that could contribute to such volatility include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated results of our commercialization and continued development of Iclusig, including potential approvals of Iclusig in additional markets and lines of therapy;\n\u2022\nour development and the expected timing of any regulatory approvals of brigatinib and our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe commercial potential of brigatinib and our other product candidates, and, if approved, actual or anticipated results of our commercialization of these product candidates;\n\u2022\nrumors or announcements regarding transactions involving our company, products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nadditional actual or anticipated actions taken by regulatory agencies that may impact Iclusig, brigatinib and our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nevidence of the safety or efficacy of Iclusig, brigatinib and our other product candidates, including additional data on serious adverse events;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including the securities class action and product liability lawsuits pending against us;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding results and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nannouncements of financial results and other operating performance measures, including product revenues;\n\u2022\nour funding resources and requirements, including announcements of new equity or debt financings and collaboration or licensing transactions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our receipt of, or our failure to receive, future milestones under our license agreements with our collaborators;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding existing collaborations or new collaborations or our failure to enter into collaborations;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding product developments, pricing or regulatory decisions involving companies developing or marketing competing products;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new therapeutic product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to intellectual property rights, including licensing, litigation and governmental regulation;\n\u2022\nhealthcare or cost-containment proposals, legislation and public policy pronouncements;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general;\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or senior management; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nThe stock markets, and the markets for biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Investors may not be able to sell when they desire due to insufficient buyer demand and may realize less than, or lose all of, their investment.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and provisions in our charter and bylaws could delay, discourage or make more difficult a third-party acquisition of control of us.\nBecause we are a Delaware corporation, certain provisions of Delaware law could delay, discourage or make more difficult a third-party acquisition of control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders or the stockholders regard it as such. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which prohibits certain \u201cbusiness combination\u201d transactions (as defined in Section 203) with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined in Section 203 as a 15 percent or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after a stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d, unless the attaining of \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d status or the transaction is pre-approved by our board of directors, the transaction results in the attainment of at least an 85 percent ownership level by an acquirer or the transaction is later approved by our board of directors and by our stockholders by at least a 66 2/3 percent vote of our stockholders other than the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d, each as specifically provided in Section 203.\nIn addition, because our board of directors is a classified board, as described below, Section 141(k)(1) of the DGCL provides that directors may only be removed by the stockholders and then only for \u201ccause\u201d. Further, Section 242(b)(1) of the DGCL provides that amendment of our certificate of incorporation requires that the amendment be determined by the board of directors to be advisable and be submitted by our board of directors to our stockholders for action by them and then approved by our stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, each as currently in effect, also contain certain provisions that may delay, discourage or make more difficult a third-party acquisition of control of us:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors, with three classes of directors, each serving for a staggered three-year term, such that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nthe authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nany vacancies on the board of directors may only be filled by a majority of the directors then serving, although not a quorum, and not by the stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential unsolicited acquirer and so possibly hinder an acquisition of control of us that is not approved by our board of directors, including through the use of preferred stock in connection with a shareholder rights plan which we could adopt by action of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nrecord date-setting provisions for annual and special meetings of stockholders and actions by written consent, provisions regulating the conduct of meetings of stockholders and action by written consent, and \u201cadvance notice\u201d timing and informational requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors at stockholder meetings or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings or by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders, the limitation of matters to be acted upon at an annual meeting of stockholders to those matters proposed by us or properly brought before the meeting and the limitation of matters to be acted upon at a special meeting of stockholders to matters which we place on the agenda for the meeting.\nThese provisions of the DGCL and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay, discourage or make more difficult certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the current market price, and might limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interest.", "PERMNO": 80918, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARIA"}
