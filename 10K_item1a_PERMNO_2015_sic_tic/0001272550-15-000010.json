RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWE HAVE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS\nWe have experienced substantial and continuing losses from operations. These are the result of declining revenues and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses incurred in preparation for growth. We expect that our cyber security operations and the operations of IPSA, which we acquired in February 2015, will increase revenues and help move the Company to profitability from operations, of which there can be no assurance.\nA DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF, OR DEMAND FOR, ANY OF OUR BUSINESS ADVISORY SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES, WOULD HARM OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS.\nOur Business Advisory Solutions services accounted for the majority of our revenues in 2013 (approximately 55%), and 2014 (approximately 64%). We anticipate that revenue from the Business Advisory Solutions services, particularly in view of the acquisition of IPSA International, which will be combined with the Business Advisory group, will continue to constitute the majority of our revenues for the near term and anticipate that revenue in the Cybersecurity segment could, in the future, exceed the revenues of our Business Advisory Solutions group, of which there can be no assurance. A decline in the price of, or demand for, Business Advisory Solutions services or the failure to achieve substantial growth in cyber security revenue would harm our business.\nA SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS REVENUES DEPEND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE CUSTOMERS. IF ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS DECIDE THEY WILL NO LONGER USE OUR SERVICES, REVENUES WILL DECREASE AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WILL BE SEVERELY IMPACTED.\nTo date, we have received a significant portion of our revenues from large sales to a small number of customers. During 2014 and 2013, our five largest customers, together comprised approximately 34% and 47% of our total revenues, respectively. Our operating results may be harmed if we are not able to complete one or more substantial sales to any large customers or are unable to collect accounts receivable from any of the large customers in any future period.\nINTENSE COMPETITION IN OUR TARGET MARKETS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO GROW AND TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. IF WE DO NOT GROW, OUR COMPETITIVE ABILITY WILL BE SEVERELY RESTRICTED, WHICH WOULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY.\nOur competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Our competitors include Deloitte, Accenture, Fireeye and SAI Global as well as other national firms and a number of smaller regional firms. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources, or greater name recognition than us. Our\ncompetitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any one of which could seriously harm our business.\nOUR LENGTHY SALES CYCLE COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE OUR GROWTH OBJECTIVES.\nThe period between initial contact with a potential customer and that customer\u2019s purchase of services is often long. A customer\u2019s decision to purchase services involves a significant allocation of resources on our part, is influenced by a customer\u2019s budgetary cycles, and in many instances involves a preferred-vendor process. To successfully sell our services, generally we must educate the potential customers regarding the uses and benefits of our services, which can require significant time and resources. Many potential customers are large enterprises that generally take longer to designate preferred vendors; the typical sales cycle in connection with becoming an approved vendor has been approximately six to 12 months. Delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter could reduce revenues in that quarter, as well as subsequent quarters over which revenues for the sale would likely be recognized. If the sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general, or for one or more large orders, it would adversely affect the timing of revenues and revenue growth. If we were to experience a delay of several weeks on a large order, it could harm our ability to meet forecasts for a given quarter.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE NECESSARY FUNDING IN THE FUTURE WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GROW, INCREASE REVENUES, AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.\nUnless we achieve positive cash flow, substantial working capital will be required for continued operations. We believe that if capital requirements increase materially from those currently planned, additional financing may be required sooner than anticipated. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage of our capital stock owned by our current shareholders would be reduced, and those equity securities may have rights that are senior to those of the holders of our currently outstanding securities. Additional financing may not be available when needed on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to curtail planned growth, and we may be unable to develop or enhance planned products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures.\nTHERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS.\nAn integral part of our growth strategy has been evaluating and, from time to time, consummating acquisitions. These transactions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management\u2019s attention from running the existing business; increased expenses, including legal, administrative and compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees; increased costs to integrate personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired company; adverse effects on reported operating results due to possible impairment of intangible assets including goodwill associated with acquisitions; and dilution to stockholders to the extent of issuance of securities in the transaction. .\nOUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, AND MAJOR STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE ABLE TO EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER US,WHICH WILL LIMIT OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF KEY DECISIONS.\nOur executive officers and directors collectively control approximately 23.5% of our current outstanding capital stock and approximately 27.0% on a fully diluted basis. As a result, if they act together they will be able to influence management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing any change in control of our Company and might affect the market price of the common stock.\nMiriam Blech currently controls approximately 7.0% of our outstanding voting capital stock, including 60% of our Series C preferred stock. Isaac Blech currently controls approximately 4.6% of our outstanding voting capital stock (which is included in the above figures concerning officers and directors), including 40% of our Series C preferred stock. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Blech currently control approximately 11.6% of our outstanding voting capital stock, including 100% of our Series C preferred stock. The interests of Mr. and Mrs. Blech may differ from the interests of other stockholders. Third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid or it may make it easier for them to acquire root9B because of this concentration of ownership.\nIthan Creek Master Investors (Cayman), L.P. currently controls approximately 9.0% of our outstanding voting capital stock, In addition they can increase their ownership thru exercise of warrants up to approximately 17.0%.\nA FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified professional and/or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs, either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals, is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for these professionals is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel. Our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers, and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers.\nIf we are unable to retain qualified personnel, the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled, which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating new employees. In addition, the failure to attract and retain key employees, including officers, could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively.\nRisks Related to root9B\nOUR FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED CYBER EXPERTS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified professional and/or skilled cyber personnel, either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals, is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for these professionals is very competitive as well as limited for senior level operators with the Department of Defense experience we seek. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the needed personnel. The failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could impair our ability to sell, provide services to our clients, and conduct our business effectively by limiting the number of engagements we can handle concurrently and could limit our ability to work on large scale projects.\nINTENSE COMPETITION IN OUR TARGET MARKETS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO GROW AND TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.\nThe market for cyber solutions work has been developing rapidly over the past several years and continues to change as new entrants enter the market and as legislation moves forward in this area. As competition increases, there could be impact on the markets and pricing which will present a risk to the revenue growth for root9B.\nOUR SALES CYCLES CAN BE LONG AND UNPREDICTABLE, AND OUR SALES EFFORTS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE TIME AND EXPENSE. AS A RESULT, OUR SALES AND REVENUE ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY VARY SUBSTANTIALLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource intensive nature of our sales efforts, the length and variability of our sales cycle and the short-term difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to large organizations. The length of our sales cycle, from proof of concept to delivery of and payment for our products, is typically four to twelve months but can be more than a year. To the extent our competitors develop products that our prospective customers view as equivalent to ours, our average sales cycle may increase. Because the length of time required to close a sale varies substantially from customer to customer, it is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale with a potential customer. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is delayed.\nAs a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast our revenue accurately in any quarter. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if our revenue falls below our or analysts\u2019 expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO SELL OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS RENEWALS OF OUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SERVICES, TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR FUTURE REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE HARMED.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our products with new and existing customers, including solutions delivered through the new Adversarial Pursuit Center,. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts and may not result in additional sales. In addition, the rate at which our customers purchase additional products, subscriptions and services depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional IT security as well as general economic conditions. If our efforts to sell additional products, subscriptions and services to our customers are not successful, our business would suffer.\nFurther, existing customers that purchase our products have no contractual obligation to renew their subscriptions and support and maintenance services beyond the initial contract period, and given our limited operating history, we may not be able to accurately predict our renewal rates. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of their satisfaction with our products, our customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our products compared with the products and services offered by our competitors. We cannot assure that our customers will renew their subscriptions, and if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, if at all.\nWe also depend on our installed customer base for future support and maintenance revenue. We offer our support and maintenance agreements for terms that generally range between one and five years. If customers choose not to renew their support and maintenance agreements or seek to renegotiate the terms of their support and maintenance agreements prior to renewing such agreements, our revenue may decline.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO INCREASE SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO LARGE ORGANIZATIONS WHILE MITIGATING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVING SUCH CUSTOMERS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY SUFFER.\nOur growth strategy is dependent, in part, upon increasing sales of our solution to large enterprises and governments. Sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present (or that are present to a lesser extent) with sales to smaller entities. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nIncreased purchasing power and leverage held by large customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;\n\u00b7\nMore stringent or costly requirements imposed upon us in our support service contracts with such customers;\n\u00b7\nMore complicated implementation processes;\n\u00b7\nLonger sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that ultimately does not purchase our platform or solutions\n\u00b7\nMore pressure for discounts and write-offs\nIn addition, because security breaches with respect to larger, high-profile enterprises are likely to be heavily publicized, there is increased reputational risk associated with serving such customers. If we are unable to increase sales of our platform to large enterprise and government customers while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial position and results of operations may suffer.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE VALUE OF OUR CYBER SECURITY BUSINESS MAY BE DIMINISHED, AND OUR CYBER SECURITY BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our cyber security proprietary rights. We presently do not intend to rely on the filing and prosecution of patent applications. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our\nproprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our cyber security business and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events would have an adverse effect on our cyber security business and financial results.\nWE MAY, IN THE FUTURE, BE A PARTY DEFENDANT TO PATENT LAWSUITS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CLAIMS THAT ARE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND, IF RESOLVED ADVERSELY, WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CYBER SECURITY BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nCompanies in the cyber security business often own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce new products, including in areas where we currently do not operate, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nA DATA SECURITY BREACH WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AS A RESULT OF OUR CYBERSECURITY PROCESSES COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON US FINANCIALLY, LEGALLY AS WELL AS IMPACT OUR REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE\nAs a part of our services we access customers environments, if this access led to the opportunity for a data breach by others, although remote, and if this happened and it was determined we were liable this could cause significant damage to our reputation, have an adverse impact on our results of operations as well as lead to the possibility of litigation and other financial liabilities.\nRisks related to IPSA\nAN INABILITY TO RETAIN IPSA\u2019S SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OTHER MANAGING DIRECTORS WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE SUCCESS OF IPSA\u2019S BUSINESS.\nWe will rely heavily on IPSA senior management team, its practice leaders, and other staff; our ability to retain them is particularly important to IPSA\u2019s future success. Given the highly specialized nature of IPSA\u2019s services, the senior management team must have a thorough understanding of IPSA\u2019s service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage an organization consisting of a diverse group of professionals. In addition, we rely on IPSA\u2019s senior management team and other managing directors to generate and market IPSA\u2019s business. Further, IPSA\u2019s senior management\u2019s and other managing directors\u2019 personal reputations and relationships with IPSA\u2019s clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements.\nIPSA\u2019S INABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN TALENTED PEOPLE IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE THERE IS GREAT COMPETITION FOR TALENT COULD HAVE A SERIOUS NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR PROSPECTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIPSA\u2019s business involves the delivery of professional services and is highly labor-intensive. Its success depends largely on its ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled professionals. Further, IPSA must successfully maintain the right mix of professionals with relevant experience and skill sets if IPSA is to continue to grow, as it expands into new service offerings, and as the market evolves. The loss of a significant number of its professionals, the inability to attract, hire, develop, train, and retain additional skilled personnel, or failure to maintain the right mix of professionals could have a serious negative effect on IPSA, including its ability to manage, staff, and successfully complete its existing engagements and obtain new engagements.\nCHANGES IN CAPITAL MARKETS, LEGAL OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS BEYOND IPSA\u2019S CONTROL COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR IPSA\u2019S SERVICES, IN WHICH CASE IPSA\u2019S REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD DECLINE.\nA number of factors outside of its control affect demand for IPSA\u2019s services. These include:\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in U.S. and global economies;\n\u00b7\nThe U.S. or global financial markets and the availability, costs, and terms of credit;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nOther economic factors and general business conditions.\nWe are not able to predict the positive or negative effects that future events or changes to the U.S. or global economy, financial markets, regulatory and business environment could have on IPSA\u2019s operations.\nIPSA\u2019S REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED AND IT COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES IF IT FAILS TO PROTECT CLIENT AND EMPLOYEE DATA.\nIPSA relies on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with its clients, partners, and employees. The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches which could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\nIn providing services to clients, IPSA may manage, utilize, and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data. As a result, IPSA is subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and international laws such as the European Union Directive on Data Protection.\nThese laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If any person, including any of IPSA\u2019s employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches its established controls with respect to client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, IPSA could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. In addition, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, or misappropriation, could damage IPSA\u2019s reputation and cause it to lose clients and their related revenue in the future.\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL RISKS.\nIPSA operates both domestically and internationally, including in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. IPSA intends to continue to expand internationally. These operations result in additional risks that are not present domestically and which could adversely affect IPSA\u2019s business:\n\u00b7\ncompliance with additional U.S. regulations and those of other nations applicable to international operations;\n\u00b7\ncultural and language differences;\n\u00b7\nemployment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors;\n\u00b7\nlosses related to start-up costs, lack of revenue, higher costs due to low utilization, and delays in purchase decisions by prospective clients;\n\u00b7\ncurrency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which are harder to predict in the current adverse global economic climate;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences and limitations on our ability to utilize losses generated in IPSA\u2019s foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ndifferent regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business;\n\u00b7\ndifferent or less stable political and economic environments;\n\u00b7\ngreater personal security risks for employees traveling to or located in unstable locations; and\n\u00b7\ncivil disturbances or other catastrophic events.\nFurther, conducting business abroad subjects IPSA to increased regulatory compliance and oversight. For example, in connection with its international operations, it is subject to laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. The provisions of the U.K. Bribery Act may apply outside of the U.K. and due to its U.K. based subsidiaries, IPSA and its employees could be subject to liability for alleged activities involving bribery even if such activities were to take place outside of the U.K. A failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory enforcement actions as well as substantial civil and criminal penalties assessed against us and our employees.\nIPSA\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD SUFFER IF IT IS UNABLE TO ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN ADEQUATE UTILIZATION AND SUITABLE BILLING RATES FOR ITS CONSULTANTS.\nIPSA\u2019s profitability depends to a large extent on the utilization and billing rates of its professionals. Utilization of its professionals is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe number and size of client engagements;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of the commencement, completion and termination of engagements, which in many cases is unpredictable;\n\u00b7\nIPSA\u2019s ability to transition its consultants efficiently from completed engagements to new engagements;\n\u00b7\nthe hiring of additional consultants because there is generally a transition period for new consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements;\n\u00b7\nIPSA\u2019s ability to forecast demand for its services and thereby maintain an appropriate level of consultants; and\n\u00b7\nconditions affecting the industries in which IPSA practices as well as general economic conditions.\nThe billing rates of IPSA\u2019s consultants that it is able to charge are also affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nclients\u2019 perception of our ability to add value through IPSA\u2019s services;\n\u00b7\nthe market demand for the services IPSA provides;\n\u00b7\nan increase in the number of clients in the government sector;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new services by IPSA or its competitors;\n\u00b7\ncompetition and the pricing policies of its competitors; and\n\u00b7\ncurrent economic conditions.\nA SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF IPSA\u2019S REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF CLIENTS, AND ITS ENGAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ITS LARGEST CLIENTS, CAN BE TERMINATED BY CLIENTS WITH LITTLE OR NO NOTICE AND WITHOUT PENALTY, WHICH MAY CAUSE ITS OPERATING RESULTS TO BE UNPREDICTABLE.\nIPSA has derived, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of clients. Its five largest clients accounted for approximately 94%, 94%, and 93% of its revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. IPSA\u2019s clients typically retain it on an engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under fixed-term contracts; the volume of work performed for any particular client is likely to vary from year to year, and a major client in one fiscal period may not require or may decide not to use our services in any subsequent fiscal period. Moreover, a large portion of new engagements comes from existing clients. Accordingly,\nthe failure to obtain new large engagements or multiple engagements from existing or new clients could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenues IPSA generates. In addition, almost all engagement agreements can be terminated by its clients with little or no notice and without penalty.\nIPSA\u2019S ENGAGEMENTS COULD RESULT IN PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY, WHICH COULD BE VERY COSTLY AND HURT OUR REPUTATION.\nIPSA\u2019s engagements typically involve complex analyses and the exercise of professional judgment. As a result, IPSA is subject to the risk of professional liability. Litigation alleging that IPSA performed negligently or breached any other obligations could expose it to significant legal liabilities and, regardless of outcome, is often very costly, could distract management, could damage its reputation, and could harm its financial condition and operating results.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD PRECLUDE IPSA FROM ACCEPTING ENGAGEMENTS, THEREBY CAUSING DECREASED UTILIZATION AND REVENUES.\nIPSA provides services that usually involve sensitive client information. IPSA\u2019s engagement agreement with a client or other business reasons may preclude it from accepting engagements from time to time with its clients\u2019 competitors or adversaries. As IPSA grows its operations and the complement of consulting services, the number of conflict situations may continue to increase. Moreover, in industries in which IPSA provides services, there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances. These consolidations and alliances reduce the number of companies that may seek IPSA\u2019s services and increase the chances that IPSA will be unable to accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interest. If IPSA is unable to accept new engagements for any reason, its consultants may become underutilized, which would adversely affect IPSA\u2019s revenues and results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nTHE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIMITED.\nOur common stock is thinly-traded and any recently reported sales price may not be a true market-based valuation of our common stock. There can be no assurance that an active market for our common stock will develop. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to operating performance. Consequently, holders of shares of our common stock may not be able to liquidate their investment in our shares at prices that they may deem appropriate.\nOUR EXISTING PREFERRED STOCK HAS LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMMON STOCK HOLDERS.\nIn the event of our dissolution, liquidation or change of control, the holders of our Series B and Series C preferred stock will receive a liquidation preference in priority to the holders of our common stock. A consolidation or merger, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or a sale of 50% or more of our common stock would be treated as a change of control for this purpose. Therefore, it is possible that holders of common stock will not obtain any proceeds upon any such event.\nTHE ISSUANCE OF SHARES UPON CONVERSION OF THE PREFERRED STOCK AND EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS COULD CAUSE IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.\nThe issuance of shares upon conversion of our outstanding preferred stock and exercise of warrants could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders since the selling stockholders may ultimately convert and sell the full amount issuable on conversion.\nOUR COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED A \u201cPENNY STOCK.\"\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that generally define \"penny stock\" to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the\nability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors hereunder to sell their shares. Additionally, previously we were considered a \u201cshell company\u201d (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act). As a result, the Company will be required to continue to file current information in order for the holders of our securities to rely on Rule 144 in order to sell their restricted securities. In addition, since our common stock is traded on the OTCQB, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of the stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price.\nTHERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STOCK TRADING ON THE OTCQB RATHER THAN A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE.\nThere are significant consequences associated with our stock trading on the OTCQB rather than a national securities exchange. The effects of not being able to list our securities on a national securities exchange include:\n\u00b7\nLimited release of the market prices of our securities;\n\u00b7\nLimited news coverage of our Company;\n\u00b7\nLimited interest by investors in our securities;\n\u00b7\nVolatility of our stock price due to low trading volume;\n\u00b7\nIncreased difficulty in selling our securities in certain states due to \u201cblue sky\u201d restrictions;\n\u00b7\nLimited ability to issue additional securities or to secure financing.\nWE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT, STOCKHOLDERS WILL BENEFIT FROM AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMMON STOCK ONLY IF IT APPRECIATES IN VALUE.\nWe have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance operations and further expand and grow the business, including growth through acquisitions. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. We cannot assure you that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 16530, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "RTNB"}
