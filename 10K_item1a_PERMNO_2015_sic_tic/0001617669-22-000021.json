{"cik": "1617669", "company": "Unique Fabricating, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. Some of our risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate to the securities markets in general and ownership of our common stock. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Going Concern\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, as a result of violations by us of financial covenants in our senior secured credit facility which, to date, have not been amended or waived. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the Company was in violation of a number of its loan covenants. Absent amendment of such covenants and waiver of the violations, failure to be in compliance with the Company\u2019s financial covenants constitute a default when reported. Such a default, if not waived by our lenders, would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt, making it due and payable at that time. If the maturity of the debt were accelerated, the Company would not have sufficient available liquidity to repay such debt within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has been actively discussing its results and the Company\u2019s failure to meet its financial covenants with the Administrative Agent and has entered into a forbearance agreement and amendments to this forbearance agreement, providing a period commencing on April 9, 2021 and currently through May 30, 2022, during which the Company will be able to borrow on its revolving line of credit, subject to the terms and conditions to making a revolving credit advance, including availability based on our accounts receivable and inventory, and the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms of the forbearance agreement, to forbear from enforcing their rights or seeking to collect payment of the Company\u2019s debt or disposing of the collateral securing the debt. However, entering into a forbearance agreement has not and will not alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has used the forbearance period to continue negotiations with the Lenders to enter into an amendment and waiver to cure the defaults. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into an amendment or waiver with the Lenders or if it enters into an amendment, what the terms, restrictions, and covenants of the amendment will contain. Without an amendment and waiver that cures the default, substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern remains.\nRisks Related to the Coronavirus\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has and will continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOutbreaks of COVID-19, other contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 outbreaks significantly impacted economic activity and markets worldwide, and it could continue to negatively affect our business in a number of ways. These effects include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aaDisruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work effectively due to illness, travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, or other limitations.\n\u25aaNet sales to automotive customers, most of whom have decreased output as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic driven supply chain shortages, were approximately 89% of the Company\u2019s net sales during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u25aaIn an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical and other supplies and products, we have elected and may further elect to, or governments may require us to, allocate manufacturing capacity in a way that could adversely affect our regular operations and that may adversely impact our customer and supplier relationships.\n\u25aaCosts incurred and revenues lost during and from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been and likely will not be recoverable.\n\u25aaThe failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, customers, contractors, commercial banks, and other business partners, to meet their respective obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties.\n\u25aaThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital for both the Company and our customers and suppliers.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or other outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats materially and adversely impacts our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak. In addition, how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume cannot be predicted, and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nWe have substantial debt and we have failed to comply with certain of the covenants in our secured credit agreement, which allows our lenders to take action that, if taken, would likely cause our stockholders to lose their entire investment in us.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $48.4 million of debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility. Substantially all our assets are pledged to the lenders to secure this outstanding debt. As a result of our failure to comply with financial and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit facility, the lenders have declared an event of default, although they have not accelerated the amounts outstanding or sought to foreclose on the collateral securing such indebtedness. We have entered into a forbearance agreement and amendments during which our Lenders have agreed, among other things, during the period commencing on April 9, 2021 through and including May 30, 2022 to forbear from enforcing their rights or seeking to collect payment of the Company\u2019s debt or disposing of collateral securing the debt. There can be no assurance that the Company, during the forbearance period, will be able to enter into an amendment or waiver curing the defaults. If the Company does not obtain an amendment or waiver of the defaults or if the lenders take the position that the Company has not complied with the terms of the forbearance agreement, there can be no assurance that the lenders will not take action to collect payment of our debt or dispose of collateral securing the debt. In such event, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection and stockholders would likely lose their entire investment in us.\nThe agreement governing our senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants and other covenants that may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions. Our inability to comply with these covenants would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the Company was in violation of a number of its loan covenants. The Company has requested amendments to these covenants, but its lenders have not agreed to such amendments. Our ability to comply with the covenants in the senior secured credit facility agreement, even if they are amended, may be affected by economic or business conditions beyond our control. If we are not able to comply with covenants when required and we are unable to obtain necessary waivers or amendments from the lenders, we would be precluded from borrowing under the credit facility. If we are unable to borrow under the credit facility, we will need to meet our liquidity requirements using other sources. Based on our recent results, we cannot be assured that alternative sources of liquidity will be available, including cash generated by operations. In addition, if we do not comply with the financial or other covenants in the credit facility when required, the lenders could declare an event of default under the credit facility, and our indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable. The lenders would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIn addition, the senior secured credit facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u25aaincur liens;\n\u25aaincur or assume additional debt or guarantees;\n\u25aapay dividends, or make redemptions and repurchases, with respect to capital stock;\n\u25aamake loans and investments;\n\u25aamake capital expenditures;\n\u25aaengage in mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions, and transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25aachange the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in this debt agreement and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nOur substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, and make payments on our indebtedness.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. The level of our indebtedness could have other important consequences to you as a stockholder. For example, it could:\n\u25aamake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u25aamake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u25aarequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pay dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25aalimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25aaplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25aalimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other purposes.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Internal Controls and Accounting\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and our ability to comply with the requirements of our senior secured credit facility or other financing agreements and adversely impact the trading price of our securities.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls, and complying with other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company\u2019s internal controls.\nIn connection with the preparation of our 2020 financial statements, we identified material weaknesses, primarily related to ineffective controls over the financial close process. Throughout 2021, the Company remediated the material weaknesses by focusing resources on refining and implementing controls around the financial reporting process. If we are unable to successfully maintain adequate financial reporting controls, and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our financial statements and other disclosures could contain material misstatements or omissions that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our shares to decline or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial results or condition.\nOur goodwill has been subject to impairment and may continue to be subject to impairment in the future.\nThe Company had $17.0 million of goodwill on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if potential interim indicators exist. Impairment may result from various factors, including adverse changes in assumptions used for valuation purposes, such as actual or projected revenue growth rates, profitability or discount rates. If the testing indicates that an impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the fair value of the goodwill. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a prolonged period of global economic weakness, a decline in economic conditions, or a slow economic recovery, adverse changes in the market share of our products, or other factors which could result in reductions in our sales or profitability over an extended period. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future impairments, if any. We have experienced impairment charges with respect to goodwill, and we may experience such charges in the future, particularly if our business performance declines or expected growth is not realized. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $5.1 million of goodwill impairment charges. Please refer to Note 7 for more information regarding the 2021 goodwill impairment charge. It is possible that material changes in our business, market conditions, or assumptions about our market share or position could occur over time. Any future impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Customers\nOur major customers may exert significant influence over us.\nThe vehicle component supply industry has traditionally been highly fragmented and serves a limited number of large OEMs. As a result, OEMs have historically had a significant amount of leverage over their outside suppliers. Our arrangements with major OEM and Tier 1 customers frequently provide for an annual productivity cost reduction. Historically, cost reductions through product design changes, increased productivity and efficiency, and cost reduction programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer-imposed cost down requirements. However, if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in our customers\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss or insolvency of any of our major customers would adversely affect our future results.\nOur three largest direct customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 22% of our direct net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. Predominantly, we enter into purchase order commitments with our customers, based on their current or projected needs. We have in the past lost, and may in the future, lose customers due to the highly competitive conditions in the industries we serve. A decision by any significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to materially decrease the amount of products purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us or to stop doing business with us altogether could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business may not realize sales represented by awarded business.\nOur business estimates awarded business using assumptions, including projected future sales volumes. Our automotive OEM customers generally do not guarantee sales volumes. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that OEM customers may terminate without penalty. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not guaranteed. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections used in calculating the amount of our awarded business, we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the projected estimate. We also may not be able to recover the costs, particularly for labor, incurred for awarded business which has been terminated. This has been an increasing issue as a result of supply chain and other uncertainties affecting automotive OEMs.\nUnforeseen economic or political developments or the exacerbation of existing circumstances could have material adverse impacts on demand for our products, which in turn would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDemand for our products is sensitive to economic developments and political or other circumstances affecting such developments, for example the conflict in Ukraine. These include without limitation, the availability of inputs for semi-conductor manufacturing, inflationary pressures, consumer spending, new housing starts, and general economic conditions. The status of theses situations periodically have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our economy and directly or indirectly on demand for our products, and have also resulted in, and could in the future result in, the inability of our customers to meet their contractual terms or forecasted production volumes, which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is cyclical in nature and downturns in the automotive industry could reduce the sales and profitability of our business.\nThe demand for our products is largely dependent on the North American production of automobiles. The markets for our products have been cyclical, because new vehicle demand is dependent on, among other things, consumer spending and is tied closely to the overall strength of the economy. Because our products are used principally in the production of vehicles for the automotive market, our net sales, and therefore, results of operations, are significantly dependent on the general state of the economy and other factors which affect these markets. A decline in vehicle production would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. The forecast for North American vehicle production in 2022 and 2023 includes an increase over the low levels in 2021. However, after 2024 the forecasts calls for little to no growth. We cannot provide any assurance as to the level of growth in our markets. If the market suffers an extended downturn, it could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Suppliers and Manufacturing\nWe rely on raw materials suppliers in our business and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or supplier production disruptions could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur reliance on suppliers to secure raw materials exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of our raw materials and components. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our\ncommitments to customers or could increase our operating costs. Moreover, the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products represents a significant portion of our direct manufacturing costs. The number of customers to which we are not able to pass on such price increases may increase in the future. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations. If we are not able to buy raw materials at fixed prices or pass on price increases to our customers, we may lose orders or enter into orders with less favorable terms, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe conduct some of our manufacturing in Mexico and Canada, therefore, are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including the possible effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe have two manufacturing facilities in Mexico and one in Canada. There are several risks associated with doing business in Mexico and Canada, including exposure to local economic and political conditions, export and import restrictions, tariffs, and the potential for shortages of trained labor. Our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Because a portion of our manufacturing costs are incurred in Mexican pesos and Canadian dollars, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso and U.S dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rates may have a material effect on our profitability, cash flows, financial position, and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. Any depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the Mexican peso or Canadian dollar will adversely affect the cost of our Mexican and Canadian operations when remeasured into U.S. dollars. Similarly, any appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the Mexican peso or Canadian dollar will decrease the cost of our Mexican and Canadian operations when remeasured into U.S. dollars. These risks may materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may experience margin compression from changing sales and raw material prices.\nWe generally commit to end-product pricing for a specified quantity of product for the duration of a vehicle\u2019s production, generally five to seven years. In the past, we successfully mitigated price volatility through supplier management and alternative material substitution strategies. Typically, our products are refreshed during a vehicle\u2019s production life creating opportunities to modify pricing if material costs have risen. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement or sustain such strategies in the future or modify pricing to pass potential increases in material costs to customers. Our inability to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may experience increased costs and other disruptions to our business associated with labor unions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 915 full-time and 58 contract workers. A collective bargaining agreement covering hourly workers at our Auburn Hills, Michigan facility currently expires in August 2022. The Louisville collective bargaining agreement currently expires in February 2023. Many of our customers and their suppliers also have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by us, customers or their other suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled commercial vehicles. Any work stoppage or other labor disruption involving our employees, employees of our customers, or employees of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by disrupting our ability to manufacture our products or reducing the demand for our products.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits and claims.\nOur automotive products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms, that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities, or that our insurance providers will remain financially viable. One or more successful claims against us could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe would be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel.\nOur success is dependent upon the continued services of our senior management team and other key employees. Although certain key members of our senior management have employment agreements for their continued services, there is no guaranty that each such person will choose to remain with us. The loss of any key employees (including such members of our senior management team) could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, our success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train, and retain qualified managerial, engineering, sales, and marketing personnel. The forbearance agreement into which we entered with our lenders prohibits, during the forbearance period ending on May 30, 2022, our making any payments out of the ordinary course of business, including salary or compensation or distributions for the benefit of any member, owner or director other than normal and customary employment salaries, which do not exceed sums paid for similar positions in the Company\u2019s marketplace. These restrictions, together with\nour financial condition and any new restrictions our lenders may impose, could impair our ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other key employees could impair our ability to execute our business plans and strategic initiatives, cause us to lose customers and experience reduced net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations, internal control over financial reporting, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information systems used in our business, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on information systems and technology, some of which are managed or provided by third-parties, for many activities important to our business. However, security measures cannot provide absolute assurance or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing, detecting, or responding to every such breach or disruption and/or preventing the misuse of confidential information of our business, customers, team members, or vendors. Similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors on which we rely for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur businesses are subject to statutory environmental and safety regulations in multiple jurisdictions, and the impact of any changes in regulation and/or the violation of any applicable laws and regulations by our businesses could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating: air emissions; wastewater discharges; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil, ground or air; and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. We cannot assure you that we are, or have been, in complete compliance with such environmental and safety laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In some instances, such a fine or sanction could have a material and adverse effect on us. The environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time, and we could incur material expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws. We are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property. Under these laws, we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances. The amount of such liability could be material.\nSome of our operations generate hazardous substances and wastes. If a release of such substances or wastes occurs at or from our properties, or at or from any offsite disposal location to which substances or wastes from our current or former operations were taken, or if contamination is discovered at any of our current or former properties, we may be held liable for the costs of cleanup and for any other claim by governmental authorities or private parties, together with any associated fines, penalties or damages. In most jurisdictions, this liability would arise even if we had complied with environmental laws governing the handling of hazardous substances or wastes.\nNew laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe and the automotive industry are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to health, safety, and environmental matters. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, capital markets, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy, international trade, and immigration and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by the impact of government regulations on our customers.\nAlthough the products we manufacture and supply to vehicle customers are not subject to significant government regulation, our business is indirectly impacted by the extensive governmental regulation applicable to our automotive customers. These regulations primarily relate to emissions and noise standards imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, and other regulatory agencies around the world. Vehicle customers are also subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Changes in emission standards and other\nproposed governmental regulations could impact the demand for vehicles and, as a result, indirectly impact our operations. To the extent that current or future governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for vehicles, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international relations, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, among other possible changes, there may be (i) changes in policies pertaining to the environment; (ii) changes to existing trade agreements; (iii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iv) significant increases in customs duties and tariffs on goods imported into the United States. The United States, Mexico and Canada signed a new trade agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"), which serves as the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The USMCA became effective on July 1, 2020. There can be no assurance that the ongoing transition from NAFTA to USMCA will not adversely affect our business. It remains unclear what specific actions the new U.S. administration may take to resolve trade-related issues. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nThe Company faces risks related to increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance matters.\nAttention to the environmental impacts of the automotive industry, expectations that manufacturers limit or mitigate pollution, and other societal expectations may have an adverse impact on demand for our products. Furthermore, organizations that inform investors on corporate governance and related matters produce ratings for evaluating companies on their response to ESG matters. Unfavorable ratings could lead to a detrimental perception of the Company by potential investors.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our intellectual property, which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights.\nWe protect trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information against unauthorized use by others or disclosure by persons who have access to them, such as our employees, through contractual or other arrangements. These arrangements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe are not able to pay dividends and are unlikely to pay dividends in the future.\nOur senior secured credit facility precludes the payments of dividends altogether while we are in default and any waiver of covenant violations or amendment likely will restrict or prohibit dividend payments in the future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is affected by our results and our needs for funds for use in our operations and to fund our business.\nIf our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders choose to act together, they will be able to exert significant influence over us and our significant corporate decisions and may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\nOur executive officers, directors, and certain of our large stockholders and their affiliates, to our knowledge, beneficially own approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these persons, if they were to act together, have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and they could act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, by among other things:\n\u25aadelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company;\n\u25aaentrenching our management and/or our board of directors;\n\u25aaimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving the Company;\n\u25aadiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company; or\n\u25aacausing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate or continue coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports, which may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nThere has been limited coverage of our common stock by securities analysts. We believe that the lack of research coverage has and may adversely affect the market price and trading volume for our common stock. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and a global settlement among the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, other regulatory agencies and a number of investment banks, which was reached in 2003, many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research. It may be difficult for a company such as ours, with a smaller market capitalization, to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock. This likely has had and could have a negative effect on the market price of and trading volume for our stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market may cause our stock price to decline and impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our equity securities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding 11,733,147 shares of common stock, including 2,702,500 shares of our common stock issued in our initial public offering, 9,030,647 shares of common stock owned by non-affiliates and issued in private placements, and 1,954,000 shares issued in a private placement in September 2021, the resale of which has been registered. The shares owned by non-affiliates issued before our initial public offering can be traded without restriction under Rule 144 or otherwise at this time. In addition, approximately 2,194,112 shares of common stock are owned by affiliates but can be traded subject to restrictions under Rule 144. In addition, we have registered all shares that may be issued pursuant to our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2014 Omnibus Performance Award Plan. Sales of a large number of these securities on the public market or the perception that a large number of shares may be sold could reduce the market price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise capital.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable, including transactions in which you might receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove management. These provisions:\n\u25aaallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25aaprovide for a classified board of directors, such that not all members of our board will be elected at one time;\n\u25aaprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, limit who may call stockholder meetings, and prohibit the taking of stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u25aarequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals that can be acted upon at stockholder's meetings and of director nominations to our board of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Any delay or prevention of a change in control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Public Companies\nWe incur costs as a result of being a public company, and potentially will incur more if we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d. Our management devotes substantial time to public company compliance programs and will be required to continue to devote substantial time in the future.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, insurance, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, our administrative staff is required to perform additional tasks. We expect that these expenses will increase if we no longer qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d. We have invested and intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards. This investment has resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from product development and commercial activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be\nharmed. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the future, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as a public company requires us to meet the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has and, in the future, could result in material misstatements of our annual or interim financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nWe are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and are therefore required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. This requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes the disclosure of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A \u201csignificant deficiency\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting, including the audit committee of the board of directors.", "PERMNO": 15590, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "UFAB"}
