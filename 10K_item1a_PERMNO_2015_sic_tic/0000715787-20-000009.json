{"cik": "715787", "company": "INTERFACE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings.\nSales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country\u2019s or region\u2019s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. The effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market. The effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened.\nWe compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design.\nThe floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Moreover, some of our competitors are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which could increase the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products (including products, like LVT, which may currently carry attractive margins) and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability.\nSome of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities.\nIn addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers\u2019 design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings.\nOur success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including sales personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely.\nWe believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including strong sales leaders.\nWe may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change (including not only economic downturns, but potentially other changes management believes are positive in the long term). The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the flooring industry - particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management - could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer.\nWe are implementing a multi-year transformation of our sales organization, including the implementation of standardized processes in which our sales force goes to market, interacts with customers, works with the architect and design community and, in general, operates day-to-day. We are also implementing technology tools that the sales force will be required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs, and new management positions to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees, which comprise a large portion of our sales force. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability.\nOur substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have substantial international operations. In 2019, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union. We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2019 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results. In addition, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad generally.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). In 2017, the U.K. notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and the U.K. exited the European Union on January 31, 2020. A complex and uncertain process of negotiation is taking place to determine trade agreements as well as other aspects of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit has had, and the implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. The long-term nature of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty as to when any agreement or long-term relationship strategy, including trade deals, will be agreed to and implemented by the U.K. and the European Union. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the euro and the British pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.\nOur manufacturing and supply chain abilities may be adversely impacted by an extended shutdown of our operations in China due to the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus began to impact the population of China, and it began to spread globally. In late January 2020, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, maintain the wellbeing of our employees and in accordance with governmental requirements, we temporarily closed our manufacturing facility in China through February 9, 2020. While the closure and limitations on movement in the region are expected to be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the production facility closure reoccur, or such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain in China and globally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation into our earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) calculations and rounding practices could result in potential sanctions or penalties, distraction to our management and result in litigation from third parties, each of which could adversely affect or cause variability in our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn November 2017, the SEC began an investigation into our EPS calculations and rounding practices. The investigation is ongoing and there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue further action that could result in significant costs and expenses including potential sanctions or penalties as well as distraction to management. In addition, the Company may be subject to litigation from third parties related to the matters under review by the SEC. Accordingly, the ongoing SEC investigation and/or any related litigation may give rise to risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect or cause variability in our results of operations and financial condition. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, uncertainty as to the scope, timing and ultimate findings of the matters under review by the SEC (collectively, the \u201cinvestigation\u201d); adverse effects of the investigation, including the potential financial impact on the Company in the event of an adverse outcome and on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock; the costs and expenses of the investigation, including legal fees and possible monetary penalties in the event of an adverse outcome; the risk of potential litigation or regulatory action arising from these matters; the timing of the review by the Company regarding these matters; the potential identification of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures and the impact of the same; and potential reputational damage that the Company may suffer as a result of the matters under investigation.\nLarge increases in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers.\nPetroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum based products as feedstock as well. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers.\nUnanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole third party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (\u201cLVT\u201d) could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and a single supplier for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon) or sole supplier of LVT, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our sole supplier of LVT is located in South Korea, which recently reported an outbreak of the novel coronavirus described above. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole supplier of LVT is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products or LVT on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships.\nIf we fail to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the nora acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be negatively affected.\nWe recently completed the acquisition of nora, a manufacturer and multinational marketer of resilient rubber floor coverings. The success of the acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the Company\u2019s legacy business and nora. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to successfully combine and integrate the businesses on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe integration process could divert management\u2019s attention, cause employee or customer attrition or cause other disruption;\n\u2022\nnora may not contribute to the revenues and profitability of the combined business as much as we currently expect; or\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to manage the increased indebtedness we have incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nIf we are not able to successfully combine the businesses within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected synergies and other benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the results of our operations or value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt is also possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or customers of the Company or nora, the disruption of the companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.\nWe will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the Company\u2019s legacy operations and nora. It is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nthe lack of personnel or other resources to pursue other potential business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nAny of these consequences could adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or their ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, or could reduce each company\u2019s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and the value of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us.\nOur significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.\nIt is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. As a consequence of our level of indebtedness, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements. In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expenses will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase. The terms of our Syndicated Credit Facility also limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, create liens, merge or consolidate with any other person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. They also require us to comply with certain other reporting, affirmative and negative covenants and meet certain financial tests. If we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants, a default may occur, in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions apply. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in August 2023. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate, refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified by 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to SOFR or another benchmark rate may occur over the course of the next few years. We have exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, namely our floating rate Syndicated Credit Facility. This facility allows for the use of an alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. At this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward.\nOur earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets.\nAs prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. In the past, we have had non-cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings ($61.2 million in 2008 and $44.5 million in 2007). A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.\nChanges to our facilities could disrupt our operations.\nFrom time to time, we make improvements to our physical facilities, or move operations to new ones. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results.\nWe are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, particularly in LaGrange, Georgia. At times this process can be disruptive, and there is no guarantee that these efforts will yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. In addition, while these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially adversely affect financial results due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, and general disruption as we make changes and modifications to our manufacturing facilities and processes.\nOur business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire, pandemics or other unexpected events.\nWhile we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions, pandemics or other public health crises (such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus described above), or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers\u2019 facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems-both software and computer hardware-to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:\n\u2022\nfacilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;\n\u2022\ncontrol our production processes;\n\u2022\nmanage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;\n\u2022\nreceive, process and ship orders;\n\u2022\nmanage billing, collections and payables;\n\u2022\nmanage financial reporting; and\n\u2022\nmanage payroll and human resources information.\nOur IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, like fires;\n\u2022\npower loss;\n\u2022\nsoftware \u201cbugs\u201d, hardware defects or human error; or\n\u2022\nhacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber attacks.\nAny of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm. There is no guarantee that our backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and we may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies.\nTo the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including about our employees or other individuals, security breaches may expose us to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise.", "PERMNO": 44768, "SIC": 2273, "TIC": "TILE"}
