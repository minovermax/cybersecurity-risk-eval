If any of the following risks develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Patents and Monetization Activities\nSuccess of our licensing efforts depends on our ability to sign new license agreements or otherwise enforce our intellectual property rights.\nIP licensing revenues are dependent on our ability to sign new license agreements with, or otherwise enforce our intellectual property rights against, users of our patented inventions. If users refuse to sign license agreements, we may need to resort to litigation or other measures to compel the payment of fair consideration, which to date has not been effective, and may not be effective in the future. This risk applies not only to new license agreements, but to existing license agreements with fixed expiration dates. If we fail to sign or renew license agreements on terms that are favorable to us or obtain favorable outcomes through litigation or other enforcement actions, the value of our IP could be further impaired.\nWe may have a limited number of prospective licensees.\nWe are actively pursuing licenses for our DRM and memory portfolios. However, our portfolios are applicable to only a limited number of prospective licensees. Moreover, many device makers who would have been prospective DRM licensees are shielded by adverse jury verdicts in the patent infringement cases that we filed in the Eastern District of Texas. In the memory and storage space, we believe we have licensed substantially more products than remain unlicensed. As such, we have a limited number of prospective licensees, and if we are unable to sign licenses with this limited group, licensing revenue will be adversely impacted. Moreover, if our portfolios are not demonstrably applicable to prospective licensees\u2019 products or services, whether due to poor quality, lack of breadth or otherwise, parties may refuse to sign license agreements.\nRevenue opportunities from our IP monetization efforts are limited.\nPatents have finite lives. Our IP portfolio currently consists of numerous patents that have already expired, and others that expire between 2018 and 2035. Therefore, our IP revenue opportunities are limited.\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy, costly and our licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.\nLicensing our patents takes time, with some license negotiations spanning many years. We have incurred and expect to incur significant legal and sales expenses in our efforts to sign license agreements and generate license revenues. We also expect to spend considerable resources educating prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement with us. As such, we may incur significant costs and losses before any associated revenue is generated.\nEnforcement proceedings may be costly and ineffective.\nWe may choose to pursue litigation or other enforcement action to protect our intellectual property rights, such as the ITC and district court actions against SanDisk, and the recently-filed Kingston Litigation. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex, and might require cooperation of inventors and others who are unwilling or unable to assist with enforcement. Litigation also involves several stages, including the potential for a prolonged appeals process. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Enforcement actions will likely divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations. In certain cases, we may conclude that these costs and risks outweigh the potential benefits that would arise from successful enforcement, in which event we may opt not to pursue enforcement.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by product composition and future innovation.\nOur licensing revenues have been generated from manufacturers and distributors of products that use our patented inventions. Our business prospects could be negatively impacted if prospective licensees do not use our inventions in their products, or if they later modify their products to eliminate use of our inventions. Moreover, changes in technology or customer requirements could alter product composition and render our patented inventions obsolete or unmarketable.\nOur patent management activities could impact the value of our IP.\nWe assess our IP portfolio to identify patents and patent applications that are worth preserving and patents and patent applications that are not worth preserving. Our assessment is driven by numerous factors, many of which are not scientific. Our assessment drives decisions to maintain or abandon patents and patent applications. If we make decisions that prompt abandonment of patents and patent applications with value, we could materially impact the value of our IP portfolio and our ability to generate revenue from our IP portfolio.\nChallenges to the validity or enforceability of our key patents could significantly harm our business.\nAny third party may challenge the validity, scope, enforceability and ownership of our patents. Challenges may include review requests to patent authorities, such as inter partes review and covered business method proceedings that have been initiated by ZTE, Apple, Google and SanDisk. Review proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and we cannot predict their outcome or consequences. Such proceedings may narrow the scope of our claims or may cancel some or all claims. If patent claims are canceled, we could be prevented from enforcing or earning future revenues from the canceled claims. Even if our claims are not canceled, our enforcement actions against alleged infringers may be stayed pending resolution of reviews, or courts or tribunals reviewing our patent claims could make findings adverse to our interests. Irrespective of outcome, review challenges may result in substantial legal expenses and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from our other business operations, including our ability to evaluate and acquire other businesses. Adverse decisions could impair the value of our inventions or result in a loss of our proprietary rights and may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact our business.\nPatent laws may continue to change, and may alter protections afforded to owners of patent rights, impose additional enforcement risks, increase the costs of enforcement, or increase our licensing cycles. For instance, the 2012 passage of the America Invents Act provided alleged infringers with new procedures to combat patent infringement claims, including inter partes review and covered business method proceedings to challenge patent validity. In 2013 and 2015, legislative initiatives were introduced to address perceived patent abuses by non-practicing entities, and some legislators continue to express their intention to sponsor or support similar legislation in the future. Even if legislative initiatives do not directly impact our business, such initiatives might encourage manufacturers to infringe our IP rights, lengthen our licensing cycles, increase the likelihood that we will litigate to enforce our IP rights, or make it more difficult and expensive to license our patents or enforce our patents against parties using our inventions without a license. Moreover, increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions.\nChanges of interpretations of patent law could adversely impact our business.\nOur success in review and enforcement proceedings relies in part on the historically consistent application of patent laws and regulations. Interpretations of patent laws and regulations by the courts and applicable regulatory bodies have evolved, and may continue to evolve, particularly with the introduction of new laws and regulations. Changes or potential changes in judicial interpretation could have a negative impact on our ability to monetize our patent rights.\nRisks Related to our Acquisition Activities\nWe may over-estimate the value of assets or businesses we acquire.\nWe make investments from which we intend to generate a return. We estimate the value of these investments prior to acquisition, using both objective and subjective methodologies. If we over-estimate such value, we may not generate desired returns on our investment, or we may need to adjust the value of the investments to fair value and record a corresponding impairment charge, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe may not generate a return on acquired assets.\nEven if we accurately value the investments we make, we must succeed in generating a return on the investments. Our success in generating a return depends on effective efforts of our employees and outside professionals. If we do not generate desired returns on our investments or if we are compelled to adjust the value of the investments to fair value and record a corresponding impairment charge, it could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe may pursue acquisition or investment opportunities that do not yield desired results.\nWe intend to continue investigating potential acquisitions that support our business objectives and strategy. Acquisitions are time-consuming, complex and costly. The terms of acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. We may incur significant transactional expenses, regardless of whether acquisitions are consummated. Moreover, the integration of acquired companies may create significant challenges, and we can provide no assurances that the integration of acquired businesses with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate from such acquisitions. Investigating businesses and assets and integrating newly acquired businesses or assets may be costly and time-consuming, and such activities could divert our attention from other business concerns. In addition, we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, the assumption or incurrence of contingent liabilities, possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances, any of which could negatively impact our financial position. We might not be successful in integrating acquired businesses and might not achieve desired revenues and cost benefits.\nThe financing of our acquisition activities could threaten our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nWe have substantial historical net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for United States federal income tax purposes. As explained in greater detail below, our use of our NOLs will be significantly limited if we undergo a \u201cTax Ownership Change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. If and to the extent we finance acquisitions through the sale or issuance of stock, we will likely cause an ownership shift that increases the possibility that a future Tax Ownership Change might occur. If a Tax Ownership Change occurs, we will be permanently unable to use most of our NOLs.\nAvoiding a Tax Ownership Change may limit our ability to use our shares in an acquisition which could limit our ability to execute a transaction.\nThe use of our NOLs will be significantly limited if we undergo a Tax Ownership Change. Given the potential economic benefit of our NOLs, we have taken steps to reduce the risk of a Tax Ownership Change including our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan. Issuing new shares in an acquisition transaction could cause or would increase the risk of a Tax Ownership Change. As a result, if a potential seller or partner requires a large number of shares as part of an acquisition transaction, we may choose not to execute that transaction.\nWe rely on representations, warranties and opinions from third parties that might not be accurate.\nWhen we acquire assets or businesses or establish relationships with inventors or strategic partners, we may rely on representations and warranties made by third parties. We also may rely on opinions of lawyers and other professionals. We may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such representations, warranties and opinions are made. By relying on these representations, warranties and opinions, we may be exposed to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nOur financial and operating results have been and may continue to be uneven.\nOur operating results may fluctuate and, as such, our operating results are difficult to predict. Quarterly or annual comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate during any period or that could adversely affect our operating results include the timing of license and sales agreements, compliance with such agreements, the terms and conditions for payment under those agreements, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, costs of enforcement, changes in demand for products that incorporate our inventions, the time period between commencement and completion of license negotiations or enforcement proceedings, revenue recognition principles, and changes in accounting policies.\nOur revenues may not offset our operating expenses.\nWe reported operating income in 2016 and 2017, in part because we signed significant licenses in those years and in part because we significantly reduced our year-over-year operating expenses. Moving forward, it is not feasible to reduce operating expenses as dramatically as we did in 2016 and 2017. Moreover, revenue from our IP licensing business continues to be inconsistent. If we are unable to generate revenue sufficient to cover operating costs, we will report a net operating loss in future years.\nFailure to effectively manage the composition of our employee base could strain our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on continued contributions of our small group of key managers and employees, many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace. Our success also depends on the ability of our personnel to function effectively, both individually and as a group. At the end of 2015, we terminated the employment of numerous IP professionals whose roles we believe were unnecessary to advance our current and anticipated business strategies. In 2016, we parted ways with our vice president of licensing. If we misjudged our ongoing personnel needs or lose any of our remaining senior managers or key personnel, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our clients or licensees, which could slow our growth or result in a loss of business. Moreover, if we fail to manage the composition of our employee base effectively or otherwise strain our relationships with our personnel, our business and financial results may be materially harmed.\nIf we need financing and cannot obtain financing on favorable terms, our business may suffer.\nIf we deploy a significant portion of our capital or encounter unforeseen difficulties in the future that deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated, we may need to obtain additional financing. Financing might not be available on favorable terms, if at all, may dilute our existing shareholders, and may prompt us to pursue structural changes that could impact shareholder concentration and liquidity. If we fail to obtain additional capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial reporting will no longer be subject to an audit.\nHistorically, our consolidated financial statements were audited by external audit firms registered with the Public Company Accountancy Oversight Board. Having delisted our Class A common stock from Nasdaq and filed for de-registration, we will no longer be required to have our financial statements audited. Moreover, we do not intend to engage external auditors to audit our financial statements. The absence of an external audit could increase the risk that our financial statements are not accurate or reliable.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, other contractual relationships and patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our confidential and proprietary information, our technology and our intellectual property. We cannot be certain that these protections have not been and will not be breached, that we will be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our trade secrets or\nintellectual property, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If we are unable to detect in a timely manner the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary or other confidential information or if we are unable to enforce our rights under our agreements or applicable laws, the misappropriation of such information could harm our business.\nOur company has an evolving business model, which raises doubt about our ability to increase our revenues and grow our business.\nWe have shifted our principal focus for growth away from the IP business and are evaluating opportunities that generate solid, stable income streams with greater growth potential. Those opportunities must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development. We may not be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues and otherwise grow our business as we execute on new business opportunities in the future.\nRisks Related to our Tax Losses\nWe cannot be certain that our tax losses will be available to offset any future taxable income.\nA significant portion of our NOLs were triggered when we disposed of our satellite assets. We believe these NOLs can be carried forward to offset certain future taxable income. However, the NOLs have not been audited or otherwise validated by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). We can make no assurance that we would prevail if the IRS were to challenge the amount or our use of the NOLs. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some amount of our NOLs would not be available to offset future taxable income which would result in an increase to our future income tax liability. The NOL carryforward period begins to expire in 2025 with the bulk of our NOLs expiring in 2032.\nAn Ownership Change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code may significantly limit our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nOur use of our NOLs will be significantly limited if we undergo a Tax Ownership Change. Broadly, a Tax Ownership Change will occur if, over a three-year testing period, the percentage of our stock, by value, owned by one or more 5% shareholder increases by more than 50 percentage points. For purposes of this test, shareholders that own less than 5% of our stock are aggregated into one or more separate \u201cpublic groups,\u201d each of which is treated as a 5% shareholder. Despite our adoption of certain protections against a Tax Ownership Change (such as our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan), we cannot control the trading activity of our significant shareholders. If shareholders acquire or divest their shares in a manner or at times that do not account for the loss-limiting provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations adopted thereunder, a Tax Ownership Change could occur. If a Tax Ownership Change occurs, we will be permanently unable to use most of our NOLs.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent on the generation of future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income before the expiration of the carry forward period attributable to the NOLs, which begin to expire in 2025. We generated taxable income in 2016 and 2017, but we may not generate sufficient taxable income in future years to use the NOLs before they begin expiring.\nThe value of our NOLs may be reduced by changes in the federal tax laws.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into law in 2017. TCJA resulted in several changes to federal tax law, including a reduction of the federal tax rate for corporations to 21%. The TCJA did not change our ability to use our NOLs, including potential limitation under Section 382 described above. We believe our NOLs have value to the extent they can be used to offset future taxable income. A lower overall corporate tax rate reduces that value and any further reduction to the federal corporate rate may further reduce that value.\nOur NOLs cannot be used to offset the Personal Holding Company tax.\nThe Internal Revenue Code imposes an additional tax on the undistributed income of a Personal Holding Company (\u201cPHC\u201d). In general, a corporation is classified as a PHC if 50% or more of its outstanding shares, measured by value, are owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individual shareholders at any time during the second half of a calendar year (\u201cConcentrated Ownership\u201d) and at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income is Personal Holding Company Income (\u201cPHCI\u201d). Broadly, PHCI includes items such as dividends, interest, rents and royalties, among others. Pendrell met the Concentrated Ownership test in 2016 and 2017 and more than 60% of Pendrell\u2019s adjusted ordinary gross income was PHCI. Pendrell avoided payment of PHC tax on its PHCI by distributing the PHCI to its shareholders as a dividend in December 2017. ContentGuard did not meet the Concentrated Ownership test in 2016 or 2017 due to the interest held by minority shareholders, but it is possible that ContentGuard could meet the Concentrated Ownership test in 2018. If Pendrell or ContentGuard meets the Concentrated Ownership test, generates positive net PHCI and does not distribute the PHCI as a dividend, Pendrell or ContentGuard will be subject to the PHC tax. The PHC tax, which is in addition to the income tax and cannot be offset by our NOLs, is currently levied at 20% of the net PHCI not distributed to the corporation\u2019s shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nContinued redemptions of stock will deplete our cash.\nDuring 2017, we selectively purchased some of our Class A common stock from a small number of sophisticated shareholders in private transactions. In total, we redeemed more than 30,000 shares in the aggregate from eight shareholders. We may, within legal constraints, continue to repurchase stock, which will reduce our cash balance, cement our status as a personal holding company, and exacerbate our challenges under Section 382.\nPurchases or sales of shares could significantly impact the price of our Class A common stock.\nA small number of our shareholders hold a majority of our Class A common stock. Moreover, since we de-listed our Class A common stock from Nasdaq in mid-December 2017, trading in our stock has diminished and the price of our shares has fallen. Because of our concentrated holdings and limited trading volume, future purchases and sales of shares could have a significant impact on the price of our shares.\nThe interests of our controlling shareholder may conflict with the interests of other Class A holders.\nEagle River Satellite Holdings, LLC (\u201cERSH\u201d), together with its affiliates Eagle River Investments, LLC (\u201cERI\u201d), Eagle River, Inc. and Eagle River Partners, LLC (\u201cERP\u201d) (collectively, \u201cEagle River\u201d) controls approximately 68% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Craig O. McCaw, our Executive Chairman, is the sole manager and beneficial member of ERI, which is the sole member of ERSH. Mr. McCaw is the sole shareholder of Eagle River, Inc. and the beneficial member of ERP. Accordingly, Eagle River has control over the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our governing documents, the adoption or prevention of mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets, or control changes. Eagle River is not restricted or prohibited from competing with us.\nWe have delisted our shares from Nasdaq and are therefore not subject to Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nHaving delisted our Class A common stock from Nasdaq, we need not comply with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that the compensation of officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors, and (iii) the requirement that director nominees be selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process.\nOur Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (\u201cTax Benefits Plan\u201d), as well as certain provisions in our restated articles of incorporation, may discourage takeovers, which could affect the rights of holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur Tax Benefits Plan is intended to act as a deterrent against any person or group acquiring or otherwise obtaining beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of our securities without the approval of our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation require us to take all necessary and appropriate action to protect certain rights of our common shareholders, including voting, dividend and conversion rights and rights in the event of a liquidation, merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets. Our articles of incorporation also provide that we will not avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of those rights by charter amendment, entry into an inconsistent agreement or reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution or the issuance or sale of securities. The rights protected by these provisions of the articles of incorporation include our Class B common shareholders\u2019 right to ten votes per share on matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and option to convert each share of Class B common stock into one share of Class A common stock. The provisions of the Tax Benefits Plan and our articles of incorporation could discourage takeovers of our company, which could adversely affect the rights of our shareholders.\nHaving delisted, and in light of our pending de-registration, our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nIn December 2017, we delisted our common stock from Nasdaq, and filed a de-registration notice with the SEC to de-register our Class A common stock. Elimination of our SEC reporting obligations and delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, increased employee turnover, and fewer business development opportunities.\nHaving delisted, our trading volume and common stock price may remain depressed.\nOur trading volume is relatively low, and since we delisted our shares from Nasdaq in December 2017, the price of our stock has fallen. In the absence of SEC reporting obligations and the absence of a listing on Nasdaq, trading volume may further decrease, in which case the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. More specifically, our stock (i) may be more thinly traded, making it more difficult for our shareholders to sell shares, (ii) may experience greater price volatility, and (iii) may not attract analyst coverage, all of which may result in a lower stock price. For these reasons and others, shareholders may not receive what they view as a fair price for their shares.\nOnce we have de-registered, it may be more difficult to trade our stock in compliance with laws.\nOnce we are no longer required to fulfill SEC reporting obligations, we may choose not to file current or periodic reports. Even if we choose to file reports, they likely will not be audited. The absence of those reports or the absence of an audit may mean that material information regarding the Company is not in the public domain, which may make it more difficult to buy or sell shares in compliance with applicable securities laws. For these reasons and others, shareholders may not receive what they view as a fair price for their shares.\nIf our number of record holders increases, we may be subject to SEC reporting obligations.\nWe have limited ability to control our shareholders\u2019 acquisition or disposition of shares. If our number of record holders reaches 300 or higher, we would be required to re-register our Class A common stock with the SEC, in which case we would lose the corresponding cost-saving benefits that we anticipate achieving by delisting and de-registering.", "PERMNO": 86270, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "PCOA"}
