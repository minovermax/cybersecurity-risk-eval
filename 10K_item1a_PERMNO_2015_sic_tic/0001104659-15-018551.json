{"cik": "314489", "company": "FIRST BUSEY CORP /NV/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section highlights the risks management believes could adversely affect our financial performance. Additional possible risks that could affect the Company adversely and cannot be predicted may arise at any time. Other risks that are immaterial at this time may also have an adverse impact on our future financial condition.\nConditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nIn recent years, the United States\u2019 economy faced a severe economic crisis, including a major recession from which it is recovering. Many businesses and local governments continue to experience financial difficulty and while reflecting some improvement, unemployment levels in certain sectors remain elevated. There can be no assurances that these conditions will continue to improve and in fact, these conditions could worsen. In addition, factors such as ongoing federal budget negotiations, political differences at the federal levels of the U.S. government, actions taken by the Federal Reserve System and the level of U.S. debt could have destabilizing effects on financial markets and produce heightened levels of volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s general financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where it operates and in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nFor several years, the economic environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions have improved since the recession, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing, and savings habits. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans and our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s performance depends significantly on the financial condition of and the economic conditions in the states in which it operates.\nThe largest portion of the Company\u2019s customer base is within the State of Illinois, the financial condition of which is among the most troubled of any state in the United States with credit downgrade concerns, severe pension under-funding, and budget deficits. State budget restructuring to improve its financial condition may have negative financial effects on local governments and businesses, their employees, and directly and indirectly our customers. Conversely, a lack of state budget restructuring to achieve budget balance and growing debt burden may also have negative financial effects on local governments and businesses, their employees, and directly and indirectly our customers.\nThe Company is located in markets with significant university and healthcare presence, which rely heavily on state funding and contracts. Payment delays by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have significant, negative effects on our primary market areas, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A temporary state income tax increase passed in 2011 is set to begin phasing out in 2015, which will likely affect the State\u2019s revenue. In addition, adverse changes in agribusiness and capital goods exports could materially adversely affect our downstate Illinois markets, which are heavily reliant upon these industries.\nFurther, southwest Florida was particularly impacted by the downturn in economic conditions in recent years and real estate activity and values continue to be lower relative to historical levels. Although recovering, another downturn in economic conditions in Florida, particularly within our primary market areas, could result in a decrease in demand for our products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults, high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures and reduced wealth management fees resulting from lower asset values.\nMarket volatility could have an adverse effect on us.\nIn certain periods in the past, the capital and credit markets have experienced heightened volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial condition or performance. If the capital and credit markets experience these heightened levels of disruption and volatility again, we may experience material adverse effects on our customers\u2019 and our ability to maintain or access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Company\u2019s primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment maturities and sales, deposits and funds from sales of capital securities. Additional liquidity is available through brokered deposits, repurchase agreements and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nDuring periods of economic turmoil, the financial services industry and the credit markets generally may be materially and adversely affected by significant declines in asset values and depressed levels of liquidity. These and other factors could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions with other financial institutions, lead to market-wide liquidity problems, loss of depositor, creditor, and counterparty confidence which could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Furthermore, regional and community banks generally have less access to the capital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage.\nAny decline in available funding and/or capital could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our stockholders, or meet deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future.\nAt December 31, 2014, our non-performing loans (which consist of non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing loans) totaled $9.0 million, or 0.37% of our gross loan portfolio. At December 31, 2014, our non-performing assets (which include non-performing loans plus other real estate owned and other repossessed assets) were $9.2 million, or 0.25% of total assets. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. While we pay interest expense to fund non-performing assets, we do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and returns on assets and equity, and our loan administration costs increase and our efficiency ratio is adversely affected. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which, when compared to the outstanding balance of the loan, may result in a loss. These non-performing loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. We cannot guarantee that we will not experience increases in non-performing loans in the future, and our non-performing assets may result in further losses in the future.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb actual losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on a continual analysis of our portfolio and market environment. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon other relevant information available to us. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in the relevant market areas. The actual amount of loan losses is affected by changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our markets, which may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates.\nOur allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2014 was $47.5 million. At December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 2.0%, and as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 526.7%.\nAlthough management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to record additional provisions for loan losses in the future, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or requirements by the regulators, to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, particularly if economic conditions unfold in a manner which differs significantly from what management currently expects. Additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses and loan losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the loans in our portfolio is secured by real estate.\nAt December 31, 2014, over 75% of our loans were collateralized by real estate. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses which would adversely affect profitability. Such changes especially affected our southwest Florida market in recent years during the financial crisis which began in late 2007. Adverse changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity generally, and in downstate Illinois and southwest Florida specifically, could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan which would result in losses.\nCommercial and industrial loans make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\nCommercial and industrial loans were $601.8 million, or approximately 24.9% of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2014. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, which we require whenever appropriate on commercial loans. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate construction, land acquisition and development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and we may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nConstruction, land acquisition, and development loans comprised approximately 4.4% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2014, and such lending involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it.\nThe Company is subject to lending risk.\nThere are risks in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from economic and market conditions. We attempt to reduce our credit risk through loan application approval procedures, monitoring the concentration of loans within specific industries and geographic location, and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our loan review and audit departments as well as external parties. However, while such procedures should reduce our risks, they cannot be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks. Our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans for any of a variety of reasons resulting in a rise in the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies and/or a need for increases in the provision for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk.\nEarnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investment securities, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operation. Interest rates paid on deposit products have declined significantly in recent years, but further significant decline is unlikely as interest rates on deposits have approached zero. We expect net interest margin compression in 2015 to continue to require our focus, with interest rates at historic lows.\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nFirst Busey, the Bank and Busey Wealth Management must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of the amounts necessary to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common and preferred stock and to make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, under FDIC rules, if the Bank ceases to meet the requirements to be considered a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates it pays on deposits and its ability to accept, renew or rollover deposits, particularly brokered deposits, may be restricted. As of December 31, 2014 the Bank did not have any brokered deposits.\nWe face the risk of possible future goodwill impairment.\nWe performed a valuation analysis of our goodwill, $20.7 million related to Busey Wealth Management and FirsTech, as of December 31, 2014, and the analysis indicated no impairment existed. We will be required to perform additional goodwill impairment assessments on at least an annual basis, and perhaps more frequently, which could result in further goodwill impairment charges. Any future goodwill impairment charge, on the current goodwill balance or future goodwill arising out of acquisitions, that we are required to take could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing our net income or increasing our net losses.\nThe utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nOur net deferred tax asset totaled $22.2 million as of December 31, 2014. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and the limitations of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Section 382 of the Code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock within a rolling three-year period, as calculated in accordance with the rules. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company. If we undergo an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock, our ability to use any of our net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards or net unrealized built-in losses at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of Section 382 on their use against future taxable income. The limitation may affect the amount of our deferred income tax asset and, depending on the limitation, a portion of our built-in losses, any net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them. This could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets and cannot assure they will be fully realized.\nWe had net deferred tax assets of $22.2 million as of December 31, 2014. Other than a valuation allowance against certain state net operating loss carryforwards, we did not establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014, as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management forecasts and tax planning strategies that may be available to us. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by their nature uncertain.\nIf future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, we may need to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax assets relates to a tax-effected $8.3 million state net operating loss carryforward as of December 31, 2014, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in our ownership.\nRecent legislative and regulatory reforms applicable to the financial services industry may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws, regulations, rules, policies and regulatory interpretations governing us are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time as Congress and various regulatory agencies react to adverse economic conditions or other matters. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 served as a catalyst for a number of significant changes in the financial services industry, including the Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the regulation of financial institutions in a comprehensive manner, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, which will increase both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, together with the regulations developed and to be developed thereunder, affects large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that impact how community banks, thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will operate in the future. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than its deposit base, permanently raises the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000, and expanded the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise the premiums we pay for deposit insurance. The legislation allowed financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, contains provisions on mortgage-related matters (such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and prepayment penalties) and established the CFPB as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve. This entity has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act included provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly traded companies.\nIn addition, in July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved the implementation of the Basel III Rule. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements as well as to bank and saving and loan holding companies, other than \u201csmall bank holding companies\u201d (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than 1 billion). The Basel III Rule not only increased most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, it introduces a new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. The Basel III Rule also expanded the current definition of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (i.e., Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that now generally qualify as Tier 1 Capital will not qualify or their qualifications will change when the Basel III Rule is fully implemented. However, the Basel III Rule permits banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Basel III Rule has maintained the general structure of the current prompt corrective action thresholds while incorporating the increased requirements, including the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. In order to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution under the new regime, an institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.5% or more, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8% or more, a Total Capital ratio of 10% or more, and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. Institutions must also maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Generally, financial institutions became subject to the Basel III Rule on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period through 2019 for many of the changes.\nThe implementation of these provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, will impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs.\nThese changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our management has reviewed the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Rule, many of which are to be phased-in over the next several months and years, and assessed the probable impact on our operations. However, the ultimate effect of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time.\nWe are subject to changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines.\nOur financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring, and given recent economic conditions, more drastic changes may occur. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could negatively affect us, including the acquisition of Herget Financial.\nPrior to the downturn in the economy in 2006, we had pursued a strategy of supplementing organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions in our market areas and in nearby markets that will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. As our capital position and asset quality allow, we may again supplement organic growth through acquisitions, as we did with the January 8, 2015 acquisition of Herget Financial, and which also may include the possibility of FDIC-assisted transactions involving acquisitions of failed depository institutions. There are risks associated with an acquisition strategy, however, including the following:\n\u00b7 We are exposed to potential asset and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks or businesses we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our earnings and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u00b7 Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices our management considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future in one or more markets.\n\u00b7 The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity in order to make the transaction economically feasible. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u00b7 We are subject to due diligence expenses which may not result in acquisitions.\n\u00b7 To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or issue capital stock to the sellers in an acquisition or to third-parties to raise capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\n\u00b7 We may be unsuccessful in realizing the anticipated benefits from any future acquisitions.\nOur ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings and legislation imposing new compensation restrictions could adversely affect our ability to do so.\nMuch of our success and growth has been influenced strongly by our ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market areas. Our ability to retain executive officers, current management teams, lending and retail banking officers, and administrative staff of our subsidiaries will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. It is also critical to be able to attract and retain qualified staff with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe are required to make our compensation decisions under often overlapping regulatory schemes. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC each maintain rules and guidance related to compensation practices. The Dodd-Frank Act includes additional compensation related requirements that, once fully implemented, may make it more difficult to attract and retain the people we need to operate our businesses and limit our ability to promote our objectives through our compensation and incentive programs.\nChanges in economic and market conditions may negatively impact our wealth management business.\nOur wealth management business may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic conditions and the conditions in the financial and securities markets, including the values of assets held under care. Our management contracts generally provide for fees payable for wealth management services based on the market value of assets under care. Because most of our contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, declines in securities prices will have an adverse effect on our results of operations from this business. Market declines and reductions in the value of our customers\u2019 wealth management accounts, could also result in the loss of wealth management customers, including those who are also banking customers.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services, which could harm our business.\nWe currently conduct our banking operations primarily in downstate Illinois and southwest Florida. In addition, we currently offer fiduciary and wealth management services through Trevett Capital Partners and Busey Wealth Management, which accounts for an important portion of our noninterest income. Many competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking and wealth management services within our market areas. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices or otherwise solicit deposits in our market areas. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, customers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Customers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans, deposits and commissions and brokers\u2019 fees, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking and wealth management customers, we may be unable to grow our loan and deposit portfolios and our commissions and brokers\u2019 fees, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks related to our use of technology.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to conduct our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits and our loans. However, the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as those of our customers engaging in internet banking activities.\nIn addition, we outsource certain processing functions to third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-parties, their personnel, and their use of subcontractors. Furthermore, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. Such cyber incidents may go undetected for a period of time.\nThese risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company\u2019s reputation could be affected, would could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we have procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such occurrences, cyber-security risks are a constant threat, both for us and for the third-parties we work with. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful. Any interruption in, or breach in security of, our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as those of our customers engaging in internet banking activities, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nErrors and misconduct could subject the Company to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by employees and customers could include hiding unauthorized activities, improper or unauthorized activities or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Company to financial claims for negligence.\nWe also face fraud risk associated with the origination of loans, including the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by customers or by third-parties. Customers may expose us to certain fraud risks associated with the compromise of their computing systems.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and other fraudulent transactions which might impact our business. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our securities available for sale was approximately $759.1 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDowngrades in the credit rating of one or more insurers that provide credit enhancement for our state and municipal securities portfolio may have an adverse impact on the market for and valuation of these types of securities.\nWe invest in tax-exempt state and local municipal securities, some of which are insured by monoline insurers. As of December 31, 2014, we had $221.5 million of municipal securities, which represented 29.1% of our total securities portfolio. In recent years, several of these insurers have come under scrutiny by rating agencies. Even though management generally purchases municipal securities on the overall credit strength of the issuer, the reduction in the credit rating of an insurer may negatively impact the market for and valuation of our investment securities. Such downgrade or a default by an issuer could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks, which would increase the capital we need to support our growth.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, compensation risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. Our ability to successfully identify and manage risks facing us is an important factor that can significantly impact our results. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86382, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BUSE"}
