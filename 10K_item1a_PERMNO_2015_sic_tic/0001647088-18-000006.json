If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our revenue and profitability could decline.\nAlthough our competition varies significantly by market, the modular space and portable storage unit industry, in general, is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our operations in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. We may also face reduced demand for our products and services if our competitors are able to provide new or innovative products or services that better appeal to our potential customers. In each of our current markets, we face competition from national, regional and local companies who have an established market position in the specific service area. We expect to encounter similar competition in any new markets that we may enter. Some of our competitors may have greater market share, less indebtedness, greater pricing flexibility, more attractive product or service offerings or superior marketing and financial resources. Increased competition could result in lower profit margins, substantial pricing pressure and reduced market share. Price competition, together with other forms of competition, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are exposed to operational, economic, political and regulatory risks.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we operated in the United States, Canada and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 88.8%, 8.2% and 3.0% of our revenue was generated in the United States, Canada and Mexico, respectively. The operations in these countries could be affected by foreign and domestic economic, political and regulatory risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\nmultiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to assemble, lease or sell products;\n\u2022\ninflation, recession, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable export control laws and economic sanctions laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, including increased duties and taxes and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nprice controls;\n\u2022\nownership regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable antitrust and other regulatory rules and regulations relating to potential future acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifferent local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\npressures on management time and attention due to the complexities of overseeing global operations;\n\u2022\nchallenges in maintaining, staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent labor regulations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nenforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise will not perform as expected;\n\u2022\nthe potential impact of collective bargaining;\n\u2022\nobstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business practices that may result in violation of company policies, including, but not limited to, bribery and collusive practices; and\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property in some countries.\nThese and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal or local economic movements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate our business in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our business may be negatively impacted by economic movements or downturns in the local markets in which we operate or global markets generally. These adverse economic conditions may reduce commercial activity, cause disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increase rates of default and bankruptcy. Reduced commercial activity has historically resulted in reduced demand for our products and services. For example, reduced commercial activity in the construction, energy and natural resources sectors in certain markets in which we operate, particularly the United States and Canada, has negatively impacted our business. Disruptions in financial markets could negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner and increase our counterparty risk. If economic conditions worsen, we may face reduced demand and an increase, relative to historical levels, in the time it\ntakes to receive customer payments. If we are not able to adjust our business in a timely and effective manner to changing economic conditions, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nEffective management of our rental equipment is vital to our business, and our failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain our rental equipment could harm our business and reduce our operating results and cash flows.\nOur rental equipment has a long economic life and managing this rental equipment is a critical element to our lease business. Rental equipment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers and changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which we operate. In addition, we must successfully maintain and repair this rental equipment cost-effectively to maximize the economic life of the products and the proceeds received from the sale of such products. As the needs of our customers change, we may need to incur costs to relocate or retrofit our lease assets to better meet shifts in demand. If the distribution of our lease assets is not aligned with regional demand, we may be unable to take advantage of sales and lease opportunities despite excess inventory in other regions. If we are not able to successfully manage our lease assets, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our rental equipment, or if we delay or defer such repair or maintenance or suffer unexpected losses of rental equipment due to theft or obsolescence, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new rental equipment to serve demand. These failures may also result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on poor indoor air quality and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation and profits lost from termination could materially adversely affect our future operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully acquire and integrate new operations, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions for various reasons. We anticipate that we will consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We cannot predict whether or when acquisitions will be completed, and we may face significant competition for certain acquisition targets. Acquisitions that are completed involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where our competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with regulations, such as environmental regulations and managing risks related to an acquired business;\n\u2022\nan inability to timely complete necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements;\n\u2022\nan inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nundiscovered and unknown problems, defects, liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition, particularly relating to rental equipment on lease that are unavailable for inspection during the diligence process; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key customers or employees.\nIn connection with acquisitions we may assume liabilities or acquire damaged assets, some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisitions.\nThe condition and regulatory certification of any lease fleet acquired is assessed as part of the acquisition due diligence. In some cases, lease fleet condition or regulatory certification may be difficult to determine due to fleet being on lease at the time of acquisition and/or inadequate certification records. Lease fleet acquisitions may therefore result in a rectification cost which may not have been factored into the acquisition price, impacting deployability and ultimate profitability of the lease fleet acquired.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not manage new markets effectively, some of our new branches and acquisitions may lose money or fail, and we may have to close unprofitable branches. Closing a branch in such circumstances would likely result in additional expenses that would cause our operating results to suffer. To successfully manage growth, we will need to continue to identify additional qualified managers and employees to integrate acquisitions within our established operating, financial and other internal procedures and controls. We will also need to effectively motivate, train and manage our employees. Failure to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions and new branches into existing operations could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in state building codes could adversely impact our ability to remarket our buildings, which would have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBuilding codes are generally reviewed, debated and, in certain cases, modified on a national level every three years as an ongoing effort to keep the regulations current and improve the life, safety and welfare of the building\u2019s occupants. All aspects of a given code are subject to change, including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. On occasion, state agencies have undertaken studies of indoor air quality and noise levels with a focus on permanent and modular classrooms. This process leads to a systematic change that requires engagement in the process and recognition that past methods will not always be accepted. New modular construction is very similar to conventional construction where newer codes and regulations generally increase cost. New governmental regulations may increase our acquisition costs of new rental equipment, as well as increase our costs to refurbish existing equipment.\nCompliance with building codes and regulations entails risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many \u201cbest practices\u201d which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than ours. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIf we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable, or recover our rental equipment from our customers\u2019 sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers on each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in the write-off of customer receivables and loss of units if we are unable to recover our rental equipment from our customers\u2019 sites. If we are not able to manage credit risk, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit and rental equipment losses would increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had US net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $269.9 million for US federal income tax and state tax purposes available to offset future taxable income, prior to consideration of annual limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The US NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2028 if not utilized. In addition, we had foreign NOLs of $9.9 million as a result of our operations in Mexico. The Company\u2019s Mexico NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized.\nOur US NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under Section 382 and corresponding provisions of US state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change US NOLs and other applicable pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed a Section 382 analysis and therefore cannot forecast or otherwise determine our ability to derive any benefit from our various federal or state tax attribute carryforwards at this time. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change US NOL carryforwards to offset US federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of US NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nLastly, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including the offering of the Notes, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical NOL and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it may result in increased future tax obligations.\nWe may be unable to recognize deferred tax assets such as those related to our tax loss carryforwards and, as a result, lose future tax savings, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial position.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets primarily related to deductible temporary differences based on our assessment that the item will be utilized against future taxable income and the benefit will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority. Such deductible temporary differences primarily relate to tax loss carryforwards and deferred interest expense deductions. Tax loss carryforwards arising in a given tax jurisdiction may be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years from such tax jurisdiction and reduce or eliminate income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain limitations. Deferred interest expense exists primarily within our US operating companies, where interest expense was\nnot previously deductible as incurred but may become deductible in the future subject to certain limitations. We may have to write down, via a valuation allowance, the carrying amount of certain of the deferred tax assets to the extent we determine it is not probable such deferred tax assets will continue to be recognized.\nSome of the tax loss carryforwards expire and if we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, the benefit may be permanently lost. In addition, the taxing authorities could challenge our calculation of the amount of our tax attributes, which could reduce certain of our recognized tax benefits. In addition, tax laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the ability to use carryforwards upon a change in control.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax obligations, the adoption of a new tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for inventory, services, funding and other intercompany transactions. We are subject to potential tax examinations in these jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. A number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the US are under evaluation at the federal level, but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to address base erosion and profit sharing, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations face foreign currency exchange rate exposure, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our revenues, results of operations and cash flows may also be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices, including crude oil.\nWe hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in certain currencies other than the US dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. Our consolidated financial results are denominated in US dollars and therefore, during times of a strengthening US dollar, our reported revenue in non-US dollar jurisdictions will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer US dollars. Revenue and expenses are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate for the period. In addition, the assets and liabilities of our non-US dollar subsidiaries are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Foreign currency exchange adjustments arising from certain intra-company obligations with and between our domestic companies and our foreign subsidiaries are marked-to-market and recorded as a non-cash loss or gain in each of our financial periods in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our foreign currency adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss to fluctuate. In addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the amount of US dollars we receive when we repatriate funds from our non-US dollar operations.\nOur borrowings under the ABL Facility are variable rate debt. Fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the amount of interest payments and, therefore, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. Our revenues, results of operations and cash flows are also affected by market prices for commodities such as crude oil. Commodity prices generally are affected by a wide range of factors beyond our control, including weather, disease, insect damage, drought, the availability and adequacy of supply, government regulation and policies and general political and economic conditions. At any time, our inventory levels and unfulfilled fixed or partially fixed price contract obligations may be substantial. We have processes in place to monitor exposures to these risks and engage in strategies to manage these risks. If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating our exposure to these fluctuations, we could be materially and adversely affected. Increases in market prices for commodities that we purchase without a corresponding increase in the price of our products or our sales volume or a decrease in our other operating expenses could reduce our revenues and net income.\nSignificant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our operating costs significantly and harm our profitability.\nWe incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including steel, lumber, siding and roofing, fuel and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our units and in connection with get-ready, delivery and installation of our units. The volume, timing and mix of such work may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will increase the acquisition costs of new units and also increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a truck fleet to deliver units to and return units from our customers, the cost of which is sensitive to maintenance and fuel costs. During periods of rising prices for labor or raw materials, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from customers through changes\nin pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties may fail to manufacture or provide necessary components for our products properly or in a timely manner.\nWe are often dependent on third parties to manufacture or supply components for our products. We typically do not enter into long-term contracts with third-party suppliers. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or the failure or consolidation of our suppliers. We may also experience supply problems as a result of shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\nWe are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with labor disputes and organizing activities related to unionized labor. From time to time, our operations may be disrupted by strikes, public demonstrations or other coordinated actions and publicity. We may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contractual disputes, negotiations or other labor-related disruptions. Operations where we have collective bargaining agreements with employees accounted for approximately 2% of our employees as of December 31, 2017. These operations may be more highly affected by labor force activities than others, and all collective bargaining agreements must be renegotiated annually. Other locations may also face organizing activities or effects. Labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized. Furthermore, collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to reduce the size of workforces during an economic downturn, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nFailure to retain key personnel could impede our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy.\nOne of the most important factors in our ability to profitably execute our business plan is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Many of our key executives, managers and employees have knowledge and an understanding of our business and our industry that cannot be readily duplicated and they are the key individuals that interface with customers. In addition, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is dependent on the availability of qualified personnel, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and the ability to provide a competitive compensation package. Failure to retain key personnel may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, labor shortages, the inability to hire or retain qualified employees nationally, regionally or locally or increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to control expenses and efficiently conduct our operations. We may not be able to continue to hire and retain the sufficiently skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our operating strategies. Labor expenses could also increase as a result of continuing shortages in the supply of personnel.\nIf we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe have goodwill, which represents the excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the assets acquired, and other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $28.6 million and $126.3 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, respectively, in our statement of financial position, which would represent approximately 2.0% and 9.0% of total assets, respectively. We are required to review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually for impairment. In the event impairment is identified, a charge to earnings would be recorded. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results.\nWe recorded impairment charges of $60.7 million in 2017. These charges represent non-cash impairment charges of certain of our operations recognized in connection with our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing. Any additional impairment charges in the future could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations including those governing government contracts, corruption and the environment. Obligations and liabilities under these laws and regulations may materially harm our business.\nGovernment Contract Laws and Regulations\nWe lease and sell our products to government entities, among other parties, and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts can differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain favorable pricing terms and conditions that are not typically included in private contracts, such as clauses that make certain obligations of government entities subject to budget appropriations. Many government contracts can be terminated or modified, in whole or in part, at any time, without penalty, by the government. In addition, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or the suspension of our government contracts or debarment and, as a result, the loss of the related\nrevenue which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are not aware of any action contemplated by any regulatory authority related to any possible non-compliance by or in connection with our operations.\nOur operations are subject to an array of governmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, our activities in the United States are subject to regulation by several federal and state government agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and by federal and state laws. Our operations and activities in other jurisdictions are subject to similar governmental regulations. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular business industry is also subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies in each jurisdiction relating to, among others, environmental, zoning and building standards, and health, safety and transportation matters. Noncompliance with applicable regulations, implementation of new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase costs of compliance, require a termination of certain activities or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnited States Government Contract Laws and Regulations\nOur government customers include the US government, which means we are subject to various statutes and regulations applicable to doing business with the US government. These types of contracts customarily contain provisions that give the US government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts and which are unfavorable to contractors, including provisions that allow the government to unilaterally terminate or modify our federal government contracts, in whole or in part, at the government\u2019s convenience. Under general principles of US government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may generally recover only its incurred or committed costs and settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company may be liable for any extra costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source.\nIn addition, US government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022\nspecialized disclosure and accounting requirements unique to US government contracts;\n\u2022\nfinancial and compliance audits that may result in potential liability for price adjustments, recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent, civil and criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions such as suspension or debarment from doing business with the US government;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures of certain contract and company information; and\n\u2022\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor requirements, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, our contracts may be subject to termination, and we may be subject to financial and/or other liability under our contracts or under the Federal Civil False Claims Act (the \u201cFalse Claims Act\u201d). The False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions allow private individuals, including present and former employees, to sue on behalf of the US government. The False Claims Act statute provides for treble damages and other penalties and, if our operations are found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, we could face other adverse action, including suspension or prohibition from doing business with the United States government. Any penalties, damages, fines, suspension or damages could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nAnti-Corruption Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials by a US person for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in countries that may present a more corruptible business environment than the United States. Such activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA. We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be ineffective and employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.\nIf employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including suspension or debarment from US government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of national, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations. Among other things, these laws and regulations impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, regulated materials and waste, and impose liabilities for the costs of investigating and cleaning up, and damages resulting from, present and past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. In the ordinary course of business, we use and generate substances that are regulated or may be hazardous under environmental laws. We have an inherent risk of liability under environmental laws and regulations, both with respect to ongoing operations and with respect to contamination that may have occurred in the past on our properties or as a result of our operations. From time to\ntime, our operations or conditions on properties that we have acquired have resulted in liabilities under these environmental laws. We may in the future incur material costs to comply with environmental laws or sustain material liabilities from claims concerning noncompliance or contamination. We have no reserves for any such liabilities.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist at our facilities or at third party sites for which we may be liable. Enactment of stricter laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at sites we own or third party sites may require us to make additional expenditures, some of which could be material.\nWe may be subject to litigation, judgments, orders or regulatory proceedings that could materially harm our business.\nWe are subject to claims arising from disputes with customers, employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of business. The risks associated with any such disputes may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. To the extent that our senior executives are named in such lawsuits, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs.\nAny failure of our management information systems could disrupt our business and result in decreased lease or sale revenue and increase overhead costs.\nWe depend on our management information systems to actively manage our lease fleet, control new unit capital spending and provide fleet information, including leasing history, condition and availability of our units. These functions enhance our ability to optimize lease fleet utilization, rentability and redeployment. The failure of our management information systems to perform as anticipated could damage our reputation with our customers, disrupt our business or result in, among other things, decreased lease and sales revenue and increased overhead costs. For example, an inaccurate utilization rate could cause us to fail to have sufficient inventory to meet consumer demand, resulting in decreased sales. Any such failure could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management\u2019s focus and attention from business operations and growth initiatives and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\nLike other companies, our information systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including cyber-attacks) and other security issues. In addition, because our systems contain information about individuals and businesses, the failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenue, increased costs, regulatory sanctions and other potential material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could materially adversely affect our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions such as fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorism, which could adversely affect our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September 2017 impacted our operations in Texas and Florida. We have submitted claims relating to these hurricanes to our insurers in the impacted locations, however, we may face significant delays in resolving our insurance claims or our insurers may challenge or deny parts or all of our claims. See \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating Our Business - We are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully protect us.\u201d See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Factors Affecting Our Business-Natural Disasters.\u201d In addition, the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks may directly or indirectly affect economic conditions, which could in turn adversely affect demand for our products and services. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which may materially adversely affect our business. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by asset, liability, business continuity or other insurance contracts. Also, we could face significant increases in premiums or losses of coverage due to the loss experienced during and associated with these and potential future natural or man-made disasters that may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and thereby impair our results of operations.\nMore generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the global economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully protect us.\nWe are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business. These possible claims include those relating to: (1) personal injury or death caused by containers, offices or trailers rented or sold by us; (2) motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees; (3) employment-related claims; (4) property damage and (5) commercial claims. Our insurance policies have deductibles or self-insured retentions which would require us to expend amounts prior to taking advantage of coverage limits. We believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for the protection of our assets and operations. However, our insurance may not fully protect us for certain types of claims such as dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious acts; terrorism, war, hostile or warlike action during a time of peace; automobile physical damage; natural disasters; and cybercrime.\nDemand for our products and services is sensitive to changes in demand within a number of key industry end-markets and geographic regions.\nOur financial performance is dependent on the level of demand for our products and services, which is sensitive to the level of demand within various sectors, in particular, the commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government and other end-markets. Each of these sectors is influenced not only by the state of the general global economy, but by a number of more specific factors as well. For example, demand for modular buildings within the energy and resources sector may be materially adversely affected by a decline in global energy prices. Demand for our products and services may also vary among different localities or regions.\nThe levels of activity in these sectors and geographic regions may also be cyclical, and we may not be able to predict the timing, extent or duration of the activity cycles in the markets in which we or our key customers operate. A decline or slowed growth in any of these sectors or geographic regions could result in reduced demand for its products and services, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to redeploy our units effectively should a significant number of our leased units be returned during a short period of time, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWhile our typical lease terms include contractual provisions requiring customers to retain units on lease for a specified period, our customers generally rent their units for periods longer than the contractual lease terms. As of December 31, 2017, the average lease duration of our current lease portfolio is approximately 32 months. Should a significant number of leased units be returned during a short period of time, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nFailure to close our unit sales transactions as projected could cause our actual revenue or cash flow for a particular fiscal period to differ from expectations.\nSales of new and used modular space and portable storage units to customers represented approximately 13.1% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. The completion of sale transactions is subject to certain factors that are beyond our control, including permit requirements and weather conditions. Accordingly, the actual timing of the completion of these transactions may take longer than expected. As a result, our actual revenue and cash flow in a particular fiscal period may not consistently correlate to our internal operational plans and budgets. If we are unable to prepare accurate internal operational plans and budgets, we may fail to take advantage of business and growth opportunities otherwise available and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur principal stockholder has substantial control over our business, which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders.\nSapphire, controlled by TDR Capital, beneficially owned approximately 54.8% of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock as of March 1, 2018. In addition, TDR Capital nominated two directors to serve on our board of directors and maintains a director nomination right, based on its share ownership. As a result of its ability to control a significant percentage of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, TDR Capital may have substantial control over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. TDR Capital may have interests that are different from those of other stockholders.\nOur business has not been managed as a public company since 2007 and our resources may be insufficient for a public company.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, we are subject to various regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and Nasdaq. These requirements include record keeping, financial reporting and corporate governance rules and regulations. While certain members of our management team have experience in managing a public company, we have not had all of the resources typically found in a public company since 2007. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support the increased reporting obligations, and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome lack of experience or employees. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws, the listing requirements of Nasdaq or such other national securities exchange on which our\nequity securities may trade and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of the business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business could be adversely affected if our internal infrastructure is inadequate, if we are unable to engage outside consultants or if we are otherwise unable to fulfill our public company obligations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of Sarbanes Oxley. As described in Part II Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017 due to material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting associated with accounting for income taxes and reverse acquisition accounting. We will enhance, and continue to enhance, our internal controls and expect to remediate these control deficiencies. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful or that we will be able to prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\nWe incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional change. We expect that ongoing compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, will substantially increase our expenses, including legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. It is possible that these expenses will exceed the increases projected by management. These laws, rules and regulations may also make it more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and it may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors or as officers. Although the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) may, for a limited period of time, somewhat lessen the cost of complying with these additional regulatory and other requirements, we nonetheless expect a substantial increase in legal, accounting, insurance and certain other expenses in the future, which will negatively impact its results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nGlobal capital and credit market conditions could materially and adversely affect our ability to access the capital and credit markets or the ability of key counterparties to perform their obligations to us.\nAlthough we believe the banks participating in the ABL Facility have adequate capital and resources, we can provide no assurance that all of those banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future. If any of the banks in our lending group were to fail, it is possible that the borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility would be reduced. Practical, legal and tax limitations may also limit our ability to access and service the working capital needs of other businesses in the WSII subsidiary group. In the event that the availability under the ABL Facility were reduced significantly, we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to finance our capital needs. The options for addressing such capital constraints would include, but would not be limited to, obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in the lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of the ABL Facility, and accessing the public capital markets. In addition, we may delay certain capital expenditures to ensure that we maintain appropriate levels of liquidity. If it became necessary to access additional capital, any such alternatives could have terms less favorable than those terms under the ABL Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, in the future we may need to raise additional funds to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness, fund existing operations, improve or expand its operations, respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to achieve our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. Our ability to pursue certain future opportunities may depend in part on our ongoing access to debt and equity capital markets. We cannot assure you that any such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth by, among other things, curtailing the expansion of our fleet of units or our acquisition strategy.\nEconomic disruptions affecting key counterparties could also have a material adverse effect on our business. We monitor the financial strength of our larger customers, derivative counterparties, lenders and insurance carriers on a periodic basis using publicly-available information in order to evaluate our exposure to those who have or who we believe may likely experience significant threats to their ability to adequately perform their obligations to us. The information available will differ from counterparty\nto counterparty and may be insufficient for us to adequately interpret or evaluate our exposure and/or determine appropriate or timely responses.\nOur leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $650.5 million of total indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees, consisting primarily of $310.0 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility, $300.0 million of Notes and $40.5 million of other financing obligations.\nOur leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt (including the Notes offered hereby) and liabilities;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thus reducing the availability of cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures on our existing fleet or a new fleet and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; and\n\u2022\nlimiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations, including those under the ABL Facility and the Notes, or to refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to affect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. If we default on the payments required under the terms of certain of our indebtedness, that indebtedness, together with debt incurred pursuant to other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all of our debts. As a result, our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2017, WSII and the guarantors of the Notes and the ABL Facility had up to $281.1 million available for borrowing under the ABL Facility including letters of credit, subject to borrowing base availability. Although the indenture that governs the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility do not prevent us from incurring other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will increase.\nWe are subject to and may, in the future become subject to, covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nThe ABL Facility and the Indenture, as well as any instruments that will govern any future debt obligations, contain covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way our subsidiaries can operate, including restrictions on the ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain types of stock;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to our equity securities;\n\u2022\nprepay or redeem junior debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ncreate encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the issuer or any restricted subsidiary;\n\u2022\nsell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and\n\u2022\nissue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.\nAlthough these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, these covenants could limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If any of our subsidiaries default on their obligations under the ABL Facility and the Indenture, then the relevant lenders or holders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. If the debt under the ABL Facility, the Indenture or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the ABL Facility, the Notes and our other debt.\nThe ABL Facility also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial maintenance tests in the event certain excess liquidity requirements are not satisfied. The ability to meet these tests could be affected by deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including increases in raw materials prices and unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure that these tests will be met. If an event of default occurs under the ABL Facility, the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under the ABL Facility is subject to compliance with limits based on a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder. As a result, our access to credit under the ABL Facility is subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. As a result of any change in valuation, the availability under the ABL Facility may be reduced, or we may be required to make a repayment of the ABL Facility, which may be significant. The inability to borrow under the ABL Facility or the use of available cash to repay the ABL Facility as a result of a valuation change may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nIf our warrants are exercised, the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market would increase and result in dilution to our shareholders.\nWe have 50,000,000 outstanding public warrants exercisable for 25,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. In addition, there are 19,500,000 private warrants outstanding exercisable for 9,750,000 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. To the extent warrants are exercised, additional Class A shares will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nShares held by certain significant shareholders are subject to transfer and voting restrictions under an earnout agreement. Upon release, significant sales of such shares could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could materially impair our future ability to raise capital through offerings of common stock or other equity securities.\nWe have 84,644,774 shares of Class A common stock outstanding. Our former sponsor, Double Eagle Acquisition LLC (\u201cDEAL\u201d) and Harry E. Sloan (collectively, the \u201cFounders\u201d) have deposited 12,425,000 shares of Class A common stock into escrow for a period of three years, subject to early release, pursuant to an earnout agreement entered into at the closing of the Business Combination. In addition, the Founders and our former independent directors (the \u201cInitial Shareholders\u201d) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their shares of Class A common stock until the first anniversary of the closing date of the Business Combination or earlier if, subsequent to our Business Combination, (i) the last sale price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our Business Combination, or (ii) we consummate a subsequent merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property. However, assuming such shares are released in accordance with the earnout agreement, following the termination of these transfer restrictions, we cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of common stock held by our initial shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these shares for future sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the Earnout Agreement, a release of 6,212,500 shares of Class A common stock from escrow was triggered on January 19, 2018 by the closing price of the Class A shares exceeding $12.50 per share for 20 out of 30 days.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to utilize some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and adopting new accounting standards using private company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.", "PERMNO": 15782, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "WSC"}
