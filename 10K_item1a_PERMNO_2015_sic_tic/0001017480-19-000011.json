{"cik": "1017480", "company": "HIBBETT SPORTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this report, before investing in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described in this section could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us at this time or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIntegrating City Gear\u2019s operations with ours may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized.\nThe success of the City Gear acquisition (Acquisition), including anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and cultures of City Gear into our company. It is possible that the integration process will take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, ongoing diversion of management attention, increased competition, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Acquisition could be less than anticipated.\nIf we lose any of our key vendors or any of our key vendors fail to supply us with quality brand name merchandise at competitive prices, we may not be able to meet the demand of our customers and our net sales and profitability could decline.\nWe are a retailer of manufacturers\u2019 branded items and are thereby dependent on the availability of key products and brands. Our top three vendors accounted for approximately 80% of our total inventory purchases during Fiscal 2019. Our business is dependent upon close relationships with vendors and our ability to purchase brand name merchandise at competitive prices. As a retailer, we cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products we offer for sale. Moreover, certain merchandise that is in high demand may be allocated by vendors based upon the vendors\u2019 internal criteria, which is beyond our control.\nAs a result, our sales could decline if we are not provided with a sufficient allocation of high demand merchandise from one or more of our key vendors or if the vendor\u2019s merchandise were to decline in quantity, quality or desirability to our customers. Our profits could decline if we are unable to pass along any increases in the cost of brand merchandise from our key vendors, including costs resulting from higher tariffs or taxes on imported merchandise. In addition, many of our vendors provide us with return privileges, volume purchasing allowances and cooperative marketing such that any changes to such benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that we have long-standing and strong relationships with our vendors and that we have adequate sources of brand name merchandise on competitive terms. However, the loss or decline of key vendor support could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such merchandise at competitive prices or on competitive terms in the future.\nWe also rely on services and products from non-merchandise vendors. A disruption in these services or products due to the financial condition or inefficient operations of these vendors could adversely affect our business operations.\n- 11 -\nIndex\nIf we are unable to identify and capitalize on retail trends or provide an omni-channel experience for our customers that is comparable to our competitors, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our sales and profitability may be adversely affected.\nCompetition in the e-commerce market continues to intensify as the Internet continues to facilitate competitive entry into the market and comparison shopping by consumers. As a result, a growing portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers is occurring through digital platforms rather than traditional retail stores as consumers increasingly embrace shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. Our future success could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to identify and capitalize on retail trends, including technology, e-commerce and other process efficiencies, to gain market share and better service our customers, or if we are unable to provide an omni-channel experience for our customers that is comparable to our competitors.\nIn Fiscal 2018, we successfully launched our omni-channel platform, which integrated digital commerce with our stores to provide a seamless experience for our customers. In Fiscal 2019, we launched our new mobile app, Buy Online Pickup in Store (BOPIS) and Reserve Online Pickup in Store (ROPIS) which complements our e-commerce site and provides our customers with customized advanced features and shopping experiences. We cannot give any assurances that our omni-channel platform, including our mobile app, BOPIS and ROPIS, will perform in a manner that will give us the ability to attract and retain customers, increase sales and successfully compete with other online retailers. If we do not successfully provide a relevant and up-to-date digital experience or cannot attract online buyers through our omni-channel platform, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe are increasing the use of social media as a means of interacting and enhancing the shopping experiences of our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract third parties with the specialized skills to support our omni-channel platform or are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if our websites and our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, the customer experience could be negatively affected, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and satisfaction, as well as lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons. The rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. The dissemination of negative information via social media could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy.\nIn addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social media effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.\nPressure from our competitors may force us to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing and promotion, which could lower our net sales, gross profit and operating income.\nThe business in which we are engaged is a highly competitive and evolving market. The marketplace for athletic specialty merchandise is highly fragmented as many different brick and mortar and online retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of formats and merchandising strategies. We compete with e-commerce retailers, traditional shoe stores, department and discount stores, national sporting goods superstores, specialty sporting goods shops, local sporting goods stores, outlet centers and mass merchandisers. In addition, we face competition from vendors that sell directly to consumers. Direct sales by vendors may adversely affect our market share and reduce our revenues.\n- 12 -\nIndex\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do, which enable them to spend significantly more on marketing and other initiatives. In addition, many of our competitors employ price discounting policies that, if intensified, may make it difficult for us to reach our sales goals without reducing our prices. Should our competitors increase spending on marketing and other initiatives such as additional discounting, if our marketing funds decrease for any reason, or should our marketing, promotions or initiatives be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result, we may also need to spend more on marketing, promotions and initiatives than we anticipate. Inadequate marketing that is less effective than our competitors could inhibit our ability to maintain relevance in the market place and drive increased sales.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Expansion into markets served by our competitors, entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could be detrimental to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to identify and anticipate changes in consumer demands and preferences and our inability to respond to such consumer demands in a timely manner could reduce our net sales or profitability.\nOur products appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. Our success depends on our ability to identify product trends as well as to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer demand in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to offer assortments of products that appeal to our customers or that we will satisfy changing consumer demands in the future. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if:\n\u00b7\nwe are unable to identify and respond to emerging trends, including shifts in the popularity of certain products;\n\u00b7\nwe miscalculate either the market for the merchandise in our stores or our customers\u2019 purchasing habits; or\n\u00b7\nconsumer demand unexpectedly shifts away from athletic footwear or our more profitable apparel lines.\nIn addition, we may be faced with significant excess inventory of some products and missed opportunities for other products, which could decrease our profitability.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which may adversely affect our ability to run our business effectively and our results of operations.\nWe benefit from the leadership and performance of our senior management team and other key employees. If we lose the services of any of our principal executive officers or other skilled and experienced personnel, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy or run our business effectively and operating results could suffer. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors reviews, on a regular basis, a succession plan prepared by senior management that addresses the potential loss of key personnel positions. The goal of the succession plan is to have a contingency plan that minimizes disruptions in the workplace until a suitable replacement can be found, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain existing or attract additional qualified personnel when needed.\nOn March 22, 2019, we announced the planned retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Rosenthal. Although we expect him to remain in his capacity as CEO until a successor is named and to assist in the leadership transition, he is currently under no binding agreement to do so. No assurance can be given that Mr. Rosenthal will remain through a satisfactory leadership transition or that we will be successful in finding a suitable replacement in a timely manner.\nFurther, as our business grows, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and develop, train and manage an increasing number of management-level sales associates and other employees. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages and benefits to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees and increases in the minimum wage or other employee benefit costs could increase our operating expense. An inability to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future could negatively impact our net sales growth and operating results.\n- 13 -\nIndex\nSecurity threats, including physical and cyber-security threats, and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could harm our business and reputation with our consumers.\nThe protection of Company, customer and employee data is critical to us. Through our sales, marketing activities and use of third-party information, we collect and retain certain personally identifiable information that our customers provide to purchase products, enroll in promotional programs, register on our website, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. This may include, but is not limited to, names, addresses, phone numbers, driver license numbers, e-mail addresses, contact preferences, personally identifiable information stored on electronic devices, and payment account information, including credit and debit card information. We also gather and retain information about our employees in the normal course of business. Furthermore, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, such as information permitting cashless payments.\nWe have security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information or disruption of our operations. Our risk remediation procedures include an annual IT risk assessment based on the SANS Institute Critical Security Controls framework which prioritizes security functions that are effective against the latest advanced targeted threats while emphasizing security controls that have demonstrated real world effectiveness. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover our losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\nEven so, these security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party breaches, burglaries, cyber-attacks, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, faulty password management, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Despite such safeguards for the protection of such information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems and those of our vendors and unaffiliated third-parties are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. During the normal course of our business, we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience attempts to breach our systems, and we may be unable to protect sensitive data and the integrity of our systems or to prevent fraudulent purchases. Moreover, an alleged or actual security breach that affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information could:\n\u00b7\nmaterially damage our reputation and negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty;\n\u00b7\nexpose us to negative publicity, individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions; and\n\u00b7\ncause us to incur substantial costs, including but not limited to, costs associated with remediation for stolen assets or information, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack, and increased cyber protection costs.\nWe plan to initiate a strategic realignment, which includes an accelerated store closure plan, that may not yield the economic results expected.\nAs the retail environment continues to evolve, the Company is focused on improving the productivity of the store base while continuing to grow its omni-channel business to serve customers where and when they want to shop. In an effort to adapt to changing shopping patterns, the Company has decided to initiate a strategic realignment that will include the closure of approximately 95 underperforming Hibbett stores in Fiscal 2020, while opening approximately 10 to 15 new Hibbett Sports and City Gear stores. We cannot guarantee that this strategic realignment will result in an economic benefit for the company. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the underperforming stores\u2019 liquidation process through reduced gross margin rates and increased operating costs.\n- 14 -\nIndex\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. Problems with our information systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations.\nOur ability to manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. Specifically, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage our sales, logistics, merchandise planning and replenishment, to process financial information and sales transactions and to optimize our overall inventory levels. We could experience adverse events relating to our information systems, including, among other things, system failures, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems. Although we attempt to mitigate the risk of possible business interruptions through change control protocols and a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, the failure of these systems to operate effectively and support growth and expansion could materially adversely impact the operation of our business.\nMost of our information system infrastructure is centrally located, and we rely on third-party service providers for certain system applications that are hosted remotely or in cloud-based applications. There is a risk that we may not have adequately addressed risks associated with using third-party providers or cloud-based applications. Such risks include security issues such as adequate encryption and intrusion detection; user access control; data separation; the impact of technical problems such as server outages; their disaster recovery capabilities; and exit strategies. A service provider disruption or failure in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntegration of technology and systems related to the acquired City Gear business could be more difficult or costlier than anticipated.\nIn addition, insufficient investment in technology, inadequate preventive maintenance, investment in the wrong technology, delayed replacement of obsolete equipment, shifts in technology, the failure to attract and retain highly-qualified IT personnel and inadequate policies to identify our technology needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.\nEffective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omni-channel strategy. All of our stores are subject to leases and, as such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of considerations that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such considerations include but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nchanging patterns of customer behavior from physical store locations to online shopping in the context of an evolving omni-channel retail environment;\n\u00b7\nthe appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;\n\u00b7\nthe formats, sizes and interior layouts of our stores;\n\u00b7\nthe locations of our stores, including the demographics and economic data of each store;\n\u00b7\nthe local competition in and around our stores;\n\u00b7\nthe primary lease term of each store and occupancy cost of each store relative to market rents; and\n\u00b7\ndistribution considerations for each store location.\nIf we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:\n\u00b7\nhaving to close stores and abandon the related assets while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;\n\u00b7\nincurring costs to remodel or transform our stores;\n\u00b7\nhaving stores or distribution channels that no longer meet the needs of our business; and\n\u00b7\nbearing excessive lease or occupancy expenses.\n- 15 -\nIndex\nThese consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. The financial impact of exiting a leased location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property and our relationship with the landlord. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we could still be responsible for the maintenance, taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated.\nOur success depends substantially on the value and perception of the brand name merchandise we sell.\nOur success is largely dependent on our consumers\u2019 perception and connection to the brand names we carry, such as Nike, Under Armour, Reebok, adidas, Easton, The North Face, etc. Brand value is based in part on our consumer\u2019s perception on a variety of subjective qualities so that even an isolated incident could erode brand value and consumer trust, particularly if there is considerable publicity or litigation. Consumer demand for our products or brands could diminish significantly in the event of erosion of consumer confidence or trust, resulting in lower sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe would be materially and adversely affected if all or a significant portion of our primary wholesale and logistics facility were shut down.\nOur primary wholesale and logistics facility is located in Alabaster, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham, where we receive and ship a significant portion of our merchandise. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this facility would damage a portion of our inventory and could impair our ability to adequately stock our stores and process returns of products to vendors and could adversely affect our net sales and profitability. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with shipping our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the facility.\nFurther, because we rely heavily on our primary wholesale and logistics facility, our growth could be limited if the facility reaches full capacity. Such restraint could result in a loss of market share and our inability to execute our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA disruption in the flow of imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods could significantly decrease our net sales and operating income.\nMany of our largest vendors source a majority of their products from foreign countries. Imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and contribute significantly to our favorable profit margins. Our ability to provide quality imported merchandise on a profitable basis may be subject to political and economic factors and influences that we cannot control. National or international events, including changes in government trade or other policies, could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations. If imported merchandise becomes more expensive, we may find it difficult to pass the increase on to customers. If imported merchandise becomes unavailable, the transition to alternative sources by our vendors may not occur in time to meet our demands or the demands of our customers. Products from alternative sources may also be more expensive or may be of lesser quality than those our vendors currently import. Risks associated with reliance on imported goods include:\n\u00b7\nincreases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from, for example:\n\u00b7\nimport tariffs, taxes or other governmental actions affecting trade, including the United States imposing antidumping or countervailing duty orders, safeguards, remedies or compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices;\n\u00b7\nforeign government regulations;\n\u00b7\nrising commodity prices;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs of oceanic shipping;\n\u00b7\nchanges in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\ntrade restrictions, including import quotas or loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status with the United States.\n- 16 -\nIndex\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the flow of imported goods because of factors such as:\n\u00b7\nraw material shortages, work stoppages, labor availability and political unrest;\n\u00b7\nproblems with oceanic shipping, including blockages or labor union strikes at U.S. or foreign ports; and\n\u00b7\neconomic crises and international disputes.\nIn addition, to the extent that any foreign manufacturer from whom our vendors are associated may directly or indirectly utilize labor practices that are not commonly accepted in the United States, we could be affected by any resulting negative publicity.\nDisruptions in the economy and in financial markets could adversely affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could reduce our net sales.\nIn general, our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside our control, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, household income, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, tax rates and tax refunds, sales tax holidays, energy prices, unemployment trends, home values and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Disruptions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income may adversely affect our business. A reduction in customer traffic to our stores or a shift in customer spending to products other than those sold by us or to products sold by us that are less profitable could result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover or a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.\nIncreases in transportation or shipping costs, climate change regulation and other factors may negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely upon various means of transportation, including ship and truck, to deliver products to our primary wholesale and logistics facility, our stores and our customers. Consequently, our results can vary depending upon the price of fuel. The price of oil has fluctuated significantly over the last few years. In addition, governmental efforts to combat climate change through reduction of greenhouse gases may result in higher fuel costs through taxation or other means. Any increases in fuel costs would increase our transportation costs.\nIn addition, general labor shortages or strikes in the transportation or shipping industries could negatively affect transportation and shipping costs and our ability to supply our stores in a timely manner. We also rely on efficient and effective operations within our primary wholesale and logistics facility to ensure accurate product delivery to our stores. Failure to maintain such operations could adversely affect net sales.\nWe may face difficulties in meeting our labor needs to effectively operate our business.\nWe are heavily dependent upon our labor workforce in the geographic areas where we conduct our business. Our compensation packages are designed to provide benefits commensurate with our level of expected service. However, within our retail and logistics operations, we face the challenge of filling many positions at wage scales that are appropriate to the industry and competitive factors. In addition, there is the risk that prevailing wage rates for our labor workforce will increase in the future and that the costs of employee benefits will rise, resulting in increased expenses that could adversely affect our profitability. We also face other risks in meeting our labor needs, including competition for qualified personnel and overall unemployment levels. Changes in any of these factors, including a shortage of available workforce in areas in which we operate, could interfere with our ability to adequately service our customers or to open suitable locations and could result in increasing labor costs.\n- 17 -\nIndex\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations. Furthermore, our quarterly operating results, including comparable store net sales, will fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations. We typically experience higher net sales in early spring due to spring sports and annual tax refunds, late summer due to back-to-school shopping and winter due to holiday shopping. In addition, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new store openings, the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores, weather fluctuations, merchandise mix, demand for merchandise driven by local interest in sporting events, and the timing of sales tax holidays and annual tax refunds. Any of these events, particularly in the fourth quarter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.\nComparable store net sales vary from quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in comparable store net sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. Factors which could affect our comparable store net sales results include:\n\u00b7\nshifts in consumer tastes and fashion trends;\n\u00b7\ncalendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of income tax refunds to customers;\n\u00b7\nincreases in personal income taxes paid by our customers;\n\u00b7\ncalendar shifts or cancellations of sales tax-free holidays in certain states;\n\u00b7\nthe success or failure of college and professional sports teams within our core regions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in or lack of tenants in the shopping centers in which we are located;\n\u00b7\npricing, promotions or other actions taken by us or our existing or possible new competitors; and\n\u00b7\nunseasonable weather conditions or natural disasters.\nWe cannot assure you that comparable store net sales will increase at the rates achieved in prior periods or that rates will not decline.\nWe are subject to regional risks due to our stores within the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States.\nOur stores are heavily concentrated in certain regions of the United States. We are subject to regional risks, such as the regional economy, weather conditions and natural disasters, increasing costs of electricity, oil and natural gas, as well as government regulations specific in the states and localities within which we operate. In addition, falling oil prices may adversely affect employment and consumer spending in those states that are within our regions that rely on oil revenues as a significant part of the economies of those states. We sell a significant amount of merchandise that can be adversely affected by significant weather events that postpone the start of or shorten sports seasons or that limit participation of fans and sports enthusiasts.\nUnforeseen events, including public health issues and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, snow or ice storms, floods and heavy rains could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers; significantly damage or destroy our retail locations; prohibit consumers from traveling to our retail locations; or prevent us from resupplying our stores or wholesale and logistics facility. We believe that we take reasonable precautions to prepare for such events; however, our precautions may not be adequate to deal with such events in the future. If such events occur in areas in which we have our wholesale and logistics facility or a concentration of retail stores, or if they occur during peak shopping seasons, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell a significant amount of licensed team sports merchandise, the sale of which may be subject to fluctuations based on the success or failure of such teams. The poor performance by college and professional sports teams within our core regions of operations, as well as professional team lockouts, could cause our financial results to fluctuate year over year.\n- 18 -\nIndex\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe manage cash and cash equivalents beyond federally insured limits per financial institution and purchase investments not fully guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), subjecting us to investment and credit availability risks.\nWe manage cash and cash equivalents in various institutions at levels beyond federally insured limits per institution, and we purchase investments not guaranteed by the FDIC. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will not recover the full principal of our investments or that their liquidity may be diminished. In an attempt to mitigate this risk, our investment policy emphasizes preservation of principal and liquidity. We cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits or investments.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. In addition, we face risk that financial institutions may fail to fulfill commitments under our credit facilities.\nIn connection with the acquisition of City Gear, we expanded our two credit facilities from $30 million each to $50 million each and substantially increased our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position. As of February 2, 2019, our indebtedness under our facilities was $35 million. This level of debt could have the following impacts:\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments, instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition or other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressure; and\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to economic downturns and interest rate increases.\nIn addition, our financial institutions are committed to providing loans under our credit facilities. There is a risk that these institutions cannot deliver against these obligations in a timely matter, or at all. If the financial institutions that provide these credit facilities were to default on their obligation to fund the commitments, these facilities would not be available to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. For discussion of our credit facilities, see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock.\nThe market price of our common stock, like the stock market in general, is likely to be highly volatile. Factors that could cause fluctuation in our common stock price may include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates by investment analysts and our inability to meet or exceed those estimates;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nmarket rumors or announcements by us or by our competitors of significant acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, strategic partnerships, large capital commitments or other strategic initiatives;\n\u00b7\nchanges in retail sales data that indicate consumers may spend less on discretionary purchases; and\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by key personnel or large institutional holders.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our operating performance.\n- 19 -\nIndex\nSignificant stockholders or potential stockholders may attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nStockholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the daily operations of our business or pursuing our business strategies. As a result, activist stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and the perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or that we will repurchase our common stock at favorable prices.\nIn November 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the continuation of our existing stock repurchase program (Program) until January 29, 2022 under which we may purchase up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The purchases may be made from time to time in the open market (including, without limitation, the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans), depending on a number of factors, including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions and the trading price of our common stock. The Program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund the Program with existing cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and/or borrowings under our credit facilities. A reduction in, or the completion or expiration of, our Program could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase our common stock at favorable prices, or at all.\nRisks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Matters.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects and may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7\nclassify our Board of Directors into three classes, each of which serves for different three-year periods;\n\u00b7\nprovide that a director may be removed by stockholders only for cause by a vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of our shares entitled to vote;\n\u00b7\nprovide that all vacancies on our Board of Directors, including any vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if the number is less than a quorum;\n\u00b7\nprovide that special meetings of the common stockholders may only be called by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or upon the demand of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote at any such special meeting; and\n\u00b7\ncall for a vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote in order to amend the foregoing provisions and certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors, without further action of the stockholders, is permitted to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of common stock. We are also subject to the Delaware business combination statute, which may render a change in control of us more difficult. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Laws would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.\n- 20 -\nIndex\nChanges in federal, state or local laws, or our failure to comply with such laws, could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks.\nOur Company is subject to numerous laws and regulatory matters relating to the conduct of our business. In addition, certain jurisdictions have taken a particularly aggressive stance with respect to certain matters and have stepped up enforcement, including fines and other sanctions. Such laws and regulatory matters include:\n\u00b7\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other emerging privacy laws;\n\u00b7\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) provisions that regulate telemarketing, auto-dialed and pre-recorded calls as well as text messages and unsolicited faxes;\n\u00b7\nLabor and employment laws that govern employment matters such as minimum wage, exempt employment status, overtime, family leave mandates and workplace safety regulations, including the Fair Labor Standards Act proposed rules;\n\u00b7\nSecurities and exchange laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nNew or changing laws relating to cybersecurity, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud;\n\u00b7\nNew or changing laws and regulations concerning product safety or truth in advertising;\n\u00b7\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas;\n\u00b7\nNew or changing federal and state immigration laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provisions;\n\u00b7\nNew or changing environmental regulations, including measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions; and\n\u00b7\nNew or changing laws relating to state and local taxation and licensing, including sales and use tax laws, withholding taxes and property taxes.;\nOur operations will continue to be subject to federal, state and local governmental regulation. Uncertainty with respect to the U.S. presidential administration and Congress and potential changes that may be made in laws, regulations and policies could exacerbate the risks above. Changes in domestic policy, including significant changes in tax, trade, healthcare and other laws and regulations could affect our operations. For example, tax proposals may include changes, which could, if implemented, have an adverse or a beneficial impact on our operations, including a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d or new import tariffs, which could adversely affect us because we sell imported products. Proposals to modify or repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, if implemented, may also affect us. Unknown matters, new laws and regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may affect our business or operations in the future and could lead to government enforcement and resulting litigation by private litigants. Increasing regulations could expose us to a challenging enforcement environment or to third-party liability (such as monetary recoveries and recoveries of attorney\u2019s fees) and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur corporate legal department monitors regulatory activity and is active in notifying and updating applicable departments and personnel on pertinent matters and legislation. Our Human Resources (HR) Department leads compliance training programs to ensure our field managers are kept abreast of HR-related regulatory activity that affects their areas of responsibility. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations, and although no assurances can be given, we do not foresee the need for any significant expenditures in this area in the near future.\nChanges in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages and postal mailings. Any new or emerging restrictions in federal or state laws regarding marketing and solicitation or data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages and postal mailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies. If this occurs, we may need to develop alternative marketing strategies, which may not be as effective and could impact the amount and timing of our revenues. Further, any new or emerging privacy laws could include onerous and expensive compliance obligations regarding consent, retention, deletion, and anti-discrimination that could lead to regulatory actions or litigation, and potentially fines and damages for non-compliance.\n- 21 -\nIndex\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. We may incur losses relating to these claims, and in addition, these proceedings could cause us to incur costs and may require us to devote resources to defend against these claims that could adversely affect our results of operations. For a description of current legal proceedings, see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nProduct liability claims or product recalls can adversely affect our business reputation, expose us to lawsuits or increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators and may not be fully covered by insurance.\nWe sell products, particularly athletic equipment, which entails an inherent risk of product liability and product recall and the resultant adverse publicity. We may be subject to significant claims if the purchase of a defective product from any of our stores causes injury or death. Our merchandise could be subject to a product recall which could reflect negatively on our business reputation. We cannot be assured that product liability claims will not be asserted against us in the future. Any claims made may create adverse publicity that would have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our vendors maintain insurance with respect to certain of these risks, including product liability insurance and general liability insurance, but in many cases such insurance is expensive, difficult to obtain and no assurance can be given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms, or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to any such events, or at all. Moreover, even though our insurance coverage may be designed to protect us from losses attributable to certain events, it may not adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur in connection with such events.\nWe cannot be assured that we will not experience pressure from labor unions or become the target of labor union campaigns.\nWhile we believe we maintain good relations with our employees, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not experience pressure from labor unions or become the target of labor union campaigns. The potential for unionization could increase in the United States if federal legislation or regulatory changes are adopted that would facilitate labor organization. Significant union representation would require us to negotiate wages, salaries, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our labor costs or otherwise restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nChanges in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or adverse outcomes from audits by taxing authorities could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate.\nWe operate our business in numerous tax jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of the federal rate and applicable tax rates in the various states in which we operate. Our effective tax rate may be lower or higher than our tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, including the sources of our income and the tax filing positions we take. We base our estimate of an effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our Company and on estimates of the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction. Changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, expiration of tax credits formerly available, failure to manage and utilize available tax credits, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate.", "PERMNO": 84084, "SIC": 5940, "TIC": "HIBB"}
