{"cik": "736012", "company": "INTRUSION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are the significant factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Liquidity\nThe Company\u2019s ability to implement its current business plan will be dependent on our ability to raise additional funds through additional public or private financings, which raises the possibility that the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nThe significant expense of the product launch combined with minimal sales of the INTRUSION Shield in 2021 has strained the Company\u2019s capital resources and caused significant doubt about our ability to continue our current operations as a going concern. In order to finance our operations and to continue as a going concern, we believe it will be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings, including through the utilization of our at-the-market program. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to raise additional funds through any future equity or debt financings, and the terms of those financings, if available at all, may be on terms, which are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to consummate future financings.\nPursuant to that certain securities purchase agreement we entered into in March 2022 in connection with the issuance of a promissory note to Streeterville Capital, LLC, we agreed to be subject to certain restrictions on our ability to issue securities during the term of the notes issued under the agreement. Specifically, we agreed to obtain Streeterville Capital\u2019s consent prior to issuing any debt securities or certain equity securities where the pricing of such equity securities is tied to the public trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we also must offer Streeterville with the right to purchase up to 10% of future equity and debt securities offerings, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, in each case during the term of any note issued to Streeterville.\nFurthermore, unless our public float exceeds $75 million, we will be subject to the restrictions set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 that limit our ability to conduct primary offerings under a Form S-3 registration statement, like issuances under our at-the-market program. Under such limitations, we may not sell, during any 12-month period, securities on Form S-3 having an aggregate market value of more than one-third of our public float. As of March 9, 2022, our public float calculated in accordance with General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 was $69.1 million. These restrictions may delay or prevent us from entering into funding arrangements or being able to access the capital markets, including under our at-the-market program, on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service the cash portion of our indebtedness under the March 2022 convertible notes.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness and financial commitments to the noteholder under the convertible notes issued under our March 2022 securities purchase agreement depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions including financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on that indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe terms of our March 2022 securities purchase agreement contain significant obligations and limitations that could restrict our right to enter into transactions that would otherwise be favorable to our stockholders.\nOur debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants, including the obligations to not issue debt securities or certain equity securities where the pricing of such equity securities is tied to the public trading price of the Common Stock, in each case, without the noteholder\u2019s prior consent, and offer the noteholder the right to purchase up to 10% of future equity and debt securities offerings, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. These obligations and limitations may limit our ability to enter into certain, corporate, financing, operational or capital raising transactions.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our March 2022 securities purchase agreement, there could be an event of default under the convertible notes issued thereunder, which could result in an acceleration of payments due under those notes and other consequences.\nFailure to meet the restrictions, obligations, and limitations under the March 2022 securities purchase agreement may result in an event of default in accordance with the terms of the convertible notes issued thereunder. An event of default would, among other things, provide the noteholder with the right to increase the outstanding balance by 15% for certain major events of default and 5% for others. Additionally, upon an event of default, the noteholder may consider the convertible note immediately due and payable. Furthermore, upon an event of default, the interest rate may also be increased to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.\nThe redemption feature under our March 2022 convertible notes is dependent upon the market value of our common stock, which could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders.\nThe noteholder will have the right to redeem up to $500,000 of the outstanding balance of such note per month after the notes have been issued for six months. While we have the option to make such payments in either (a) cash, (b) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of common ctock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the redemption conversion price or (c) a combination of cash and shares of common stock. Since the redemption conversion price will be equal 85% multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the common stock during the 15 trading days immediately preceding the date that the noteholder delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the note, the number of shares to be issued by us in satisfaction of this redemption will vary, perhaps considerably. A reduction in our trading value could cause us to issue a greater number of shares under a redemption notice and therefore increase the dilutive effect to other stockholders.\nWe must increase revenue levels in order to finance our current operations and to implement our business strategies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $18.8 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $80.1 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $61.3 million at December 31, 2020. We need to increase current revenue levels from the sales of our solutions if we are to regain profitability. If we are unable to increase revenue levels, losses could continue for the near term and possibly longer, and we may not regain profitability or generate positive cash flow from operations in the future.\nRisks Related to Ongoing and Potential Litigation.\nWe are currently a defendant in class action lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws, which will potentially divert the attention of our management and board of directors, require significant legal expenditures in the defense of such suit, as well as possibly result in financial liability should we be unsuccessful in the defense of these claims.\nWe are in the preliminary stages of defending class action lawsuits alleging that we have committed violations of federal securities laws and regulations. While the exact nature of these claims is not capable of being determined at this time, we will be expending time, personnel, and financial resources in our defense of these suits. Even if successful, these suits may not be resolved for a considerable period of time, during which these limited resources will be deployed and lingering uncertainty may persist in the ultimate culpability, if any, of the Company in connection with these allegations. The effect of these lawsuits during their pendency will have a negative effect on our cash flow, contribute to our liquidity challenges over the near term, and may ultimately affect our ability to operate our business.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nMost of our current revenues are generated from one family of solutions with a limited number of customers, and the decrease of revenue from sales of this family of solutions could materially harm our business and prospects.\nApproximately 86.9% of our existing revenues result from sales of TraceCop a cybersecurity solution. TraceCop revenues were $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. While we anticipate the continued introduction of our new INTRUSION Shield solution will reduce our dependence on this single solution, we can offer no assurances as such, and in the absence of a shift in solution mix, we may continue to face risks in the event that sales of this key solution to these limited customers were to decrease.\nWe may be unable to successfully market, promote, and sell our new commercial solution, INTRUSION Shield, and market it through new sales channels to a new set of prospective customers.\nWe have expended significant resources and anticipate continuing to expend significant resources launching our new INTRUSION Shield solution, including the time, attention, and focus of our senior management and our research and development team, coordination of new marketing strategies highlighting this new offering and promoting it through new and expanded sales channels to a wider audience of prospective customers than we have historically marketed and sold our solutions and services. Even if we have sufficient capital to expend on these initiatives, supporting our INTRUSION Shield products may divert resources from other critical operational areas and further strain our liquidity.\nWe may not be successful in our current efforts to broaden the marketing and sale of the INTRUSION Shield.\nWe believe that we must expand our sales and marketing efforts in order for INTRUSION Shield to achieve marketplace acceptance and to generate revenue for the Company. However, these efforts depend, in large part, on the success of our channel partners as they market and sell INTRUSION Shield, which may not be successful. Further, our new efforts in forging meaningful relationships with seasoned and well positioned strategic partners may not yield meaningful results, and any and all such efforts will need to be accomplished despite certain public remarks and comments that have been made on social media and web-based platforms as well as statements and allegations that have been, and will continue to be, advanced in the various pleadings that are publicly filed with the courts. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to leverage channel and strategic partners and to counter negative public statements, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from INTRUSION Shield to improve the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flow position.\nOur efforts to provide a cloud-based delivery system for INTRUSION Shield may not be successful or attractive to our current and potential clients.\nWe are expending significant research and development resources in order to be able to provide the INTRUSION Shield to customers in a cloud-based environment without the requirement for complementary hardware to be deployed and installed on a customer\u2019s information platforms. If this alternate product deployment is not achieved, achieved at too great an expense, or does not provide the added incentive to retain and to attract INTRUSION Shield customers, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense or to significantly contribute to our revenues, which could in turn have a negative effect on our financial position, results of operations, and our cash flow position.\nThe current geo-political climate may add uncertainty in the dealings of our customers and could cause them to delay indefinitely certain cyber-security initiatives or to determine not to introduce or implement any new or innovative cyber-solution products into their information networks.\nCurrent events in Eastern Europe and Russia have introduced a significant level of uncertainty in the dealings of our current and potential customers that could cause them to be hesitant to implement new cyber-security initiatives regardless of the efficacy of our INTRUSION Shield product. Further, these entities may also determine not to deploy their cash reserves in the face of such uncertainty. These uncertainties could depress the interest or the ability of companies and governmental entities to test, evaluate, and deploy our INTRUSION Shield in their network environments.\nThe effect of the coronavirus, particularly in the diversion of time and resources of the federal, state, and local governmental entities which make up a significant concentration of our customer base have caused, and may continue to cause, material adverse effects on our operations and our financial results.\nA significant concentration of our federal, state, and local governmental customers have been forced to allocate scarce and competing resources and balance budgetary demands placed upon them as a result of the effects of the coronavirus, mandatory quarantines, decreased travel, interruptions in workforce populations, scarcity of commodities, and similar economic and operational effects of the virus upon their own constituencies. Considerable uncertainties continue with respect to the spread and containment of the pandemic, including, without limitation, the effects of mutations in the virus and the efficacy of vaccination efforts throughout the country and the world. These adverse effects have resulted in decreased demand by some of our customers for our current product offerings and cybersecurity solutions, negatively affecting historic revenue levels for the Company. A continued decrease in orders for our solutions by our government customers and losses of efficiency or diversions of resources in our own operations may continue to cause material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nScarcity of products and materials in the supply chain could hinder or prevent the deployment of our INTRUSION Shield for our customers who elect to use the wired version of our solution.\nSupply chain interruptions have become frequent in light of the lingering commercial effects of COVID and its related variants. Should any of the component parts required for the hardware interface our customers use to access and to utilize the INTRUSION Shield product, we may have to delay or cancel our fulfillment of orders that could defer potential revenues or even result in customer cancellations, which would have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nA large percentage of our current revenues are received from U.S. government entities, and the loss of these customers or our failure to widen the scope of our customer base to include general commercial enterprises could negatively affect our revenues.\nA large percentage of our current revenues result from sales to U.S. government entities. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, our revenues could decline and our business and prospects may be materially harmed. Further, sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers, including potential disruption due to appropriation and spending patterns, delays in approving a federal budget and the government\u2019s right to cancel contracts and purchase orders for its convenience. While we expect that developing relationships with non-governmental customers will mitigate or eliminate this dependence on, and risk from, serving governmental entities, we can offer no assurances that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our customer portfolio in a time and manner to adequately mitigate this risk.\nWe are highly dependent on sales of our current solutions through indirect channels, the loss of which would materially adversely affect our operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we derived 37.5% and 49.3% of our revenues from sales through indirect sales channels, such as distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturers and managed service providers. We must expand sales of our current solutions as well as any new solutions, such as INTRUSION Shield, through these indirect channels in order to increase our revenues. We cannot assure you that our current solutions or future solutions will gain market acceptance in these indirect sales channels or that sales through these indirect sales channels will increase our revenues. Further, many of our competitors are also trying to sell their products and solutions through these indirect sales channels, which could result in lower prices and reduced profit margins for sales of our solutions.\nOur business depends on the continued service of our key management and technical personnel.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, sales, marketing, research and development and operational personnel, including Anthony Scott, our recently appointed President and Chief Executive Officer; T. Joe Head, our Chief Technology Officer; Franklin Byrd, our Chief Financial Officer; and other key technical personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We also believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management, technical, marketing, research and development, and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies, as well as training, motivating and supervising employees. The market for hiring and retaining certain technical personnel, including software engineers, has become more competitive and intense in recent years. Failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, including software engineers, or retain our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may experience volatility in our workforce and be unable to attract employees in the future as a result of our recent reduction in force.\nOn July 29, 2021, the Company executed a planned reduction in force resulting in the termination of approximately 20% of its employees. Following this reduction in force, a number of additional employees resigned, were terminated, or had their positions eliminated. As a result of these recent events, we may be unable to retain our current employees and be unable to attract new employees in the future, which would have a negative effect on the implementation of our operations.\nWe could experience damage to our reputation in the cybersecurity industry in the event that our INTRUSION Shield solution fails to meet our customers\u2019 needs or to achieve market acceptance.\nOur reputation in the industry may be harmed, perhaps significantly, in the event that INTRUSION Shield fails to perform as we expect it to. If INTRUSION Shield does not perform as we expect, if we experience delivery delays, or if our customers do not perceive the benefits of purchasing and using INTRUSION Shield as part of their comprehensive cybersecurity solution, our position as a leader in this technology space may be damaged and could affect the willingness of our customers, as well as potential customers, to purchase our other solutions that function separately from INTRUSION Shield. Any reputational damage could result in a decrease in orders for all of our solutions, the loss of current customers, and a decrease in our overall revenues which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to respond to rapid technological changes in the network security industry, we may lose customers or our solutions may become obsolete.\nThe network security industry is characterized by frequent product and service introductions, rapidly changing technology and continued evolution of new industry standards. We have and must continue to introduce upgrades to our current solutions rapidly in response to customer needs such as new computer viruses or other novel external attacks on computer networks. Further, our new INTRUSION Shield solution represents our efforts to continue to provide state-of-the art first-in-time innovation for our customer\u2019s cybersecurity solutions. As a result, our success depends upon our ability to develop and introduce timely upgrades, enhancements, and new solutions to meet evolving customer requirements and industry standards. The development of technologically advanced network security products and solutions is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, rapid response, and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced solutions successfully in a timely manner. Further, we or our competitors may introduce new solutions or enhancements that shorten the life cycle of our existing solutions or cause our existing solutions to become obsolete.\nWe must expend time and resources addressing potential cybersecurity risk, and any breach of our information security safeguards could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe threat of cyber-attacks requires additional time and money to be expended in efforts to prevent any breaches of our information security protocols. However, we can provide no assurances that we can prevent all such attempts from being successful, which could result in expenses to address and remediate such breaches as well as potentially losing the confidence of our customers who depend upon our services to prevent and mitigate such attacks on their respective business. Should a material breach of our information security systems occur, it would likely have a material adverse impact on our business operations, our customer relations, and our current and future sales prospects, resulting in a significant loss of revenue.\nA breach of network security could harm public perception of our cybersecurity solutions, which could cause us to lose revenues.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our cybersecurity solutions, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our solutions, the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed. This could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value-added resellers and distributors. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques.\nIf our solutions do not interoperate with our customers\u2019 networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.\nOur solutions are designed to interface with our customers\u2019 existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products or solutions from other vendors. Many of our customers\u2019 networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our solutions will be required to interoperate with many products and solutions within these networks as well as future products or solutions in order to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our solutions will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, if our solutions do not interoperate with those of our customers\u2019 networks, demand for our solutions could be adversely affected, orders for our solutions could be cancelled, or our solutions could be returned. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects.\nWe face intense competition from both start-up and established companies that may have significant advantages over us and our solutions.\nThe market for our solutions is intensely competitive. There are numerous companies competing with us in various segments of the data security markets, and their products or solutions may have advantages over our solutions in areas such as conformity to existing and emerging industry standards, interoperability with networking and other cybersecurity products, management and security capabilities, performance, price, ease of use, scalability, reliability, flexibility, features, and technical support.\nOur principal competitors in the data mining and advanced persistent threat market include Niksun, NetScout, FireEye, and Darktrace. Our current and potential competitors may have one or more of the following significant advantages over us:\n\u00b7 greater financial, technical and marketing resources;\n\u00b7 better name recognition;\n\u00b7 more comprehensive security solutions;\n\u00b7 better or more extensive cooperative relationships; and\n\u00b7 larger customer base.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors. Some of our competitors may have, in relation to us, one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 longer operating histories;\n\u00b7 longer-standing relationships with OEM and end-user customers; and\n\u00b7 greater customer service, public relations and other resources.\nAs a result, these competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or solutions. Additionally, it is likely that new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nInvestment Risks\nOur management and larger stockholders currently exercise significant control over our Company and such influence may be in conflict to your interests.\nAs of March 9, 2022, our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 8.7% of our voting power. In addition, other related affiliate parties control approximately 5.3% of voting power. As a result, these stockholders have been able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Although we follow our policies regarding related party transactions, we cannot entirely eliminate the influence of these stockholders as long as they hold such a concentration of the voting power of our common stock.\nWe have experienced recent volatility in the market for our common stock, particularly with respect to significant swings in the market price as well as significant volume in the trading of our common stock.\nWe have experienced extreme shifts in the market value of our common stock as it trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market as well significant increases in the trading volume of our shares on that market. For example, the market price of our common stock fluctuated between $3.05 and $29.90 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. These fluctuations may result in a hesitancy for investors to purchase and hold shares of our common stock, continued depression of the market value of our stock, and ultimately negatively affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance and sale of our common stock, particularly through our at-the-market program or otherwise.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe must adequately protect our intellectual property in order to prevent loss of valuable proprietary information.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology. However, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. This is particularly true in foreign countries whose laws may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and may not provide us with an effective remedy against unauthorized use. If protection of our intellectual property proves to be inadequate or unenforceable, others may be able to use our proprietary developments without compensation to us, resulting in potential cost advantages to our competitors.\nWe may incur substantial expenses defending ourselves against claims of infringement.\nThere are numerous patents held by many companies relating to the design and manufacture of network security systems. Third parties may claim that our solutions infringe on their intellectual property rights. Any claim, with or without merit, could consume our management\u2019s time, result in costly litigation, cause delays in sales or implementations of our solutions or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty and licensing agreements, if required and available, may be on terms unacceptable to us or detrimental to our business. Moreover, a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology on commercially reasonable terms could seriously harm our business.\nOur solutions are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected, and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our solutions and services.\nOur solutions are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks and, in the case of ours, provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information. Our solutions have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our solutions may only be discovered after a solution has been installed and used by end customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our solutions after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition could be harmed.", "PERMNO": 77624, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "INTZ"}
