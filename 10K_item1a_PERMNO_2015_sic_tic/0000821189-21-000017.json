The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cEOG\u201d refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Cash Flows\nCrude oil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile, and a substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can have a material and adverse effect on us.\nPrices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate) fluctuate widely. Among the interrelated factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022domestic and international drilling activity;\n\u2022the actions of other crude oil producing and exporting nations, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022consumer and industrial/commercial demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022worldwide economic conditions, geopolitical factors and political conditions, including, but not limited to, the imposition of tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions, political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions;\n\u2022the duration and economic and financial impact of epidemics, pandemics or other public health issues, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation, gathering, processing, compression, storage and refining facilities;\n\u2022the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources;\n\u2022the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and climate change-related initiatives;\n\u2022the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including any changes or other actions which may result from the recent elections in the United States of America (United States or U.S.) and change in administration, and including environmental and other climate change-related regulation, regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities, tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas and related commodities;\n\u2022the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and\n\u2022weather conditions and changes in weather patterns.\nIn the first half of 2020, the prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas declined substantially as a result of the economic downturn and overall reduction of demand prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil from certain foreign oil-exporting countries. In the second half of 2020, (i) the prices for NGLs and natural gas recovered to pre-pandemic levels and (ii) the prices for crude oil increased but remain significantly below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe above-described factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in 2021 and thereafter. As a result, there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas will continue to increase from, or sustain, their current levels, nor can there be any assurance that the prices for crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas will not again decline.\nOur cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices. Accordingly, substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and operating expenses, the terms on which we can access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.\nLower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial and extended declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects, resulting in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and also possibly shut in or plug and abandon certain wells. In addition, significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values, which would require us to write down the value of our properties. Such reserve write-downs and asset impairments can materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.\nIn fact, the substantial declines in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our 2020 capital expenditures and operating expenses, our results of operations during the first half of 2020 and the trading price of our common stock. Such commodity price declines also resulted in aggregate impairment charges of approximately $1.8 billion in the first half of 2020 with respect to our proved oil and gas properties and related assets. Such declines in commodity prices also resulted in our making a downward adjustment of 278 million barrels of oil equivalent to our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2020.\nIf commodity prices decline from current levels for an extended period of time, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock. In addition, we may be required to incur additional impairment charges and/or make additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations and sales of non-core assets and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, commercial paper borrowings, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings.\nLower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, however, reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned non-core asset sales and divestitures. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In addition, weakness and/or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions or a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay or adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings.\nSimilarly, a reduction in our cash flows (for example, as a result of lower crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs prices or unanticipated well shut-ins) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. A substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, our ability to obtain financings, our borrowing costs and the terms of any financings are, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. The interrelated factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels; planned capital expenditures and sales of assets; near-term and long-term production growth opportunities; liquidity; asset quality; cost structure; product mix; and commodity pricing levels (including, but not limited to, the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices). We cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future, nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered.\nReserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated.\nEstimating quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Also, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history, continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions and improvements and other changes in geological, geophysical and engineering evaluation methods.\nTo prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, gathering, processing, compression, storage and transportation costs, severance, ad valorem and other applicable taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs. Many of these factors are or may be beyond our control. Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance, including any significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. For related discussion, see ITEM 2, Properties - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves and Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels.\nThe rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities resulting in additional reserves, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. Maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, which may be adversely impacted by bans or restrictions on drilling. To the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future cash flows and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur hedging activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from increases in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.\nWe use derivative instruments (primarily financial basis swap, price swap, option, swaption and collar contracts) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. A portion of our forecasted production for 2021 and 2022 is subject to fluctuating market prices. If we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2021, 2022 and beyond, we may be materially and adversely impacted by any declines in commodity prices, which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts.\nThe inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us.\nWe have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes.\nMoreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production; the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and refining facilities; or market or other factors and conditions.\nThe inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nDrilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control.\nDrilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells.\nSpecifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding, tropical storms and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns;\n\u2022compliance with, or changes in (including the adoption of new), environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, access to and use of water, disposal or other discharge (e.g., into injection wells) of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022the availability and timely issuance of required federal, state, tribal and other permits and licenses, which may be adversely affected by (among other things) bans or restrictions on drilling, government shutdowns or other suspensions of, or delays in, government services;\n\u2022the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, store, transport, market and export crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and\n\u2022the costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services.\nOur failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, in each case, due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor.\nOur crude oil, NGLs and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities.\nOur crude oil, NGLs and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing, compressing, storing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of:\n\u2022well blowouts and cratering;\n\u2022loss of well control;\n\u2022crude oil spills, natural gas leaks, formation water (i.e., produced water) spills and pipeline ruptures;\n\u2022pipe failures and casing collapses;\n\u2022uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids;\n\u2022releases of chemicals, wastes or pollutants;\n\u2022adverse weather events, such as winter storms, flooding, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other natural disasters;\n\u2022fires and explosions;\n\u2022terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cybersecurity breaches;\n\u2022formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures;\n\u2022leaks or spills in connection with, or associated with, the gathering, processing, compression, storage and transportation of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; and\n\u2022malfunctions of, or damage to, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations.\nIf any of these events occur, we could incur losses, liabilities and other additional costs as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to, or destruction of, property, facilities, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs;\n\u2022pollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and penalties as well as cleanup and remediation responsibilities and costs;\n\u2022suspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction;\n\u2022repairs necessary to resume operations; and\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events.\nWe maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. However, the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could, in turn, have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to sell and deliver our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment are unavailable.\nThe sale of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment owned by third parties. These facilities and equipment may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In particular, in certain newer plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. In addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery.\nAny significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities and equipment, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nA portion of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, the unavailability of gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation, refining or export facilities or equipment or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil, NGLs or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties that we do not operate.\nSome of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. In addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil, NGLs or natural gas prices. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and third-party working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we acquire crude oil, NGLs and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties - for example, our October 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation and certain of its affiliated entities. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems (such as title or environmental issues), nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements.\nIn addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further above), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.\nCompetition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater resources than we have.\nWe compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services and employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel. In addition, our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition from competing energy sources, such as renewable energy sources.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks.\nOur operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks include, among other risks:\n\u2022increases in taxes and governmental royalties;\n\u2022changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;\n\u2022loss of revenue, loss of or damage to equipment, property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation, nationalization, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks;\n\u2022unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and\n\u2022currency restrictions or exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation, including tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions; modifications to, or withdrawal from, international trade treaties; and U.S. laws with respect to participation in boycotts that are not supported by the U.S. government. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, less than 1% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nThe regulatory, legislative and policy changes pursued by the new U.S. presidential administration may materially and adversely affect the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nIn November 2020, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected President of the United States. New or revised rules, regulations and policies may be issued, and new legislation may be proposed, during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Such rules, regulations, policies and legislation may affect, among other things, (i) permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands, (ii) the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development, (iii) the regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or other climate change-related matters associated with oil and gas operations, (iv) the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, (v) the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and (vi) U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled \u201cTackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\u201d directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to (i) pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and (ii) consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.\nFurther, such regulatory, legislative and policy changes may, among other things, result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements, additional operating restrictions and/or the imposition of various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations or other aspects of our business, any of which could lead to operational delays, increased operating and compliance costs and/or other impacts on our business and operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor related discussion, see the below risk factors regarding legislative and regulatory matters impacting the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nWe incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.\nOur crude oil, NGLs and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal, state, tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental, health, safety or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, health, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and/or adversely affect our business and operations and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including any changes that may result from the recent U.S. elections and change in administration (see the risk factor above with respect to the new U.S. administration).\nSpecifically, as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations, including any changes that may result from the recent U.S. elections and change in administration, could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements and, further, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has issued regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. In addition, there were proposals and positions taken by President Biden during his campaign regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters. Further, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\" directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.\nAny such requirements, restrictions, conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, further, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. Accordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected. For additional discussion regarding hydraulic fracturing regulation, see Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Other Operations - United States under ITEM 1, Business - Regulation.\nWe will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as EOG) that participate in such transactions.\nRegulations, government policies and government and corporate initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a significant impact on our operations and we could incur significant cost in the future to comply.\nLocal, state, federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years. For example, we are subject to the U.S. EPA\u2019s rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions. In addition, our oil and gas production and processing operations are subject to the U.S. EPA's new source performance standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds from new, modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations and gas processing plants.\nAt the international level, in December 2015, the U.S. participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. While the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement. In addition, many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord. Further, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled 'Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,' directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.\nIt is possible that the Paris Agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations and government policies will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations, laws, regulations, treaties or policies regarding climate change and GHG emissions (including any laws and regulations that may be enacted in the U.S. by the new administration), but the direct and indirect costs of such developments (if enacted, issued or applied) could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For additional discussion regarding climate change regulation, see (i) Climate Change - United States under ITEM 1, Business - Regulation and (ii) the risk factor above with respect to the new U.S. administration.\nIn addition, the achievement of our current or future internal initiatives relating to the reduction of GHG emissions may increase our costs, including requiring us to purchase emissions credits or offsets, or may impact or otherwise limit our ability to execute on our business plans.\nFurther, increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nTax laws and regulations applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may change over time, and such changes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, such as with respect to the intangible drilling and development costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation. While these specific changes were not included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017, no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed in the future (for example, by the new U.S. administration) and, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. The elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions, as well as any other changes to, or the imposition of new, federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in, production, severance or similar taxes), could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, legislation may be proposed with respect to the enactment of a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels based on the GHG emissions associated with such fuels. A carbon tax would generally increase the prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Such price increases may, in turn, reduce demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any proposed or enacted tax law changes, but any such changes (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or enacted tax law changes to determine the impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and take appropriate actions, where necessary.\nFederal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities.\nAs discussed in the risk factor above regarding our hedging activities, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which, among other matters, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors (the Prudential Regulators) adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities. Although some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are yet to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued numerous rules, including a rule establishing an \u201cend-user\u201d exception to mandatory clearing (End-User Exception), a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps (Margin Rule) and a proposed rule imposing position limits (Position Limits Rule).\nWe qualify as a \"non-financial entity\" for purposes of the End-User Exception and, as such, we are eligible for such exception. As a result, our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing. We also qualify as a \"non-financial end user\" for purposes of the Margin Rule; therefore, our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements. Finally, we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the Position Limits Rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted. However, many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants are not eligible for the End-User Exception, are subject to mandatory clearing and the Margin Rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties, and may be subject to the Position Limits Rule. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives (collectively, Foreign Regulations) which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, the rules adopted thereunder and the Foreign Regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, lessen the number of available counterparties and, in turn, increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, related regulations or the Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for, and fund, our capital expenditure requirements. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to COVID-19, Cybersecurity and Other External Factors\nOutbreaks of communicable diseases can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal or national health concerns, including a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, can, among other impacts, negatively impact the global economy, reduce demand and pricing for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, lead to operational disruptions and limit our ability to execute on our business plan, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding the impact of any outbreak of contagious disease could lead to increased volatility in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices.\nFor example, the current pandemic involving a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus (COVID-19) and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world, resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand and prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. In fact, the substantial declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the economic downturn and overall reduction of demand prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic (and the oversupply of crude oil from certain foreign oil-exporting countries) materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our 2020 capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our results of operations during the first half of 2020 and the trading price of our common stock.\nWhile in the second half of 2020 the prices for natural gas and NGLs recovered to pre-pandemic levels and the prices for crude oil increased from their first half 2020 levels, if such price declines were to reoccur and continue for an extended period of time, our cash flows and results of operations would be further adversely affected, as could the trading price of our common stock. For further discussion regarding the potential impacts on us of lower commodity prices and extended declines in commodity prices, see the related discussion in the first risk factor in this section.\nFurther, if the COVID-19 outbreak should continue or worsen, we may also experience disruptions to commodities markets, equipment supply chains and the availability of our workforce, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations. In addition, if the resulting economic downturn should continue or worsen, our customers and other contractual parties may be unable to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, and may be unable to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Such inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the extent of travel restrictions and business closures imposed in affected countries, to fully assess the potential impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including (i) cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, our sensitive information or to render our data or systems corrupted or unusable; (ii) threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or to the security of third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining and export facilities; and (iii) threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, including internally developed software, data hosting platforms, real-time data acquisition systems, third-party software, cloud services and other internally or externally hosted hardware and software platforms, to (i) estimate our oil and gas reserves, (ii) process and record financial and operating data, (iii) process and analyze all stages of our business operations, including exploration, drilling, completions, production, transportation, pipelines and other related activities and (iv) communicate with our employees and vendors, suppliers and other third parties. Although we have implemented and invested in, and will continue to implement and invest in, controls, procedures and protections (including internal and external personnel) that are designed to protect our systems, identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats, such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats and the controls, procedures and protections we have implemented and invested in may prove to be ineffective.\nOur systems and networks, and those of our business associates, may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks; malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. If any of these security breaches were to occur, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, including our drilling, completion, production and corporate functions, which could materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022unauthorized access to, and release of, our business data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources, or reduce our competitive advantage over other companies;\n\u2022data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions during our drilling activities, which could result in our failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\u2022data corruption or operational disruptions of our production-related infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharges;\n\u2022unauthorized access to, and release of, personal information of our royalty owners, employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect such information;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt our operations;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities, which could result in reduced demand for our production or delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, in either case resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on a communications network or power grid, which could cause operational disruptions resulting in a loss of revenues; and\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on our automated and surveillance systems, which could cause a loss of production and potential environmental hazards.\nFurther, strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at a greater risk of terrorist attacks or cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the United States. Moreover, external digital technologies control nearly all of the crude oil and natural gas distribution and refining systems in the U.S. and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. A cybersecurity attack directed at, for example, crude oil and natural gas distribution systems could (i) damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment; (ii) disrupt energy supplies and markets, by delaying or preventing delivery of production to markets; and (iii) make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.\nAny such terrorist attack or cybersecurity attack that affects us, our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business and/or energy-related assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of counterparty trust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance costs, significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention. Although we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and the infrastructure that supports our business. While we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans as well as our cyber threat detection and mitigation systems, there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts. Further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nWhile we have experienced limited cybersecurity attacks in the past, we have not suffered any losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as technologies evolve and cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, we are continually expending additional resources to modify or enhance our security measures to protect against such threats and to identify and remediate on a regular basis any vulnerabilities in our information systems and related infrastructure that may be detected, and these expenditures in the future may be significant. Additionally, the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters, including increased regulatory focus on prevention, which could require us to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.\nTerrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks (including cyber-related attacks), whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has from time to time issued public warnings that indicate that energy-related assets, such as transportation and refining facilities, might be specific targets of terrorist organizations.\nAny such actions and the threat of such actions, including any resulting political instability or societal disruption, could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including, but not limited to, the disruption of energy supplies and markets, the reduction of overall demand for crude oil and natural gas, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the facilities and other infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us.\nDemand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities that we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, lower prices for natural gas production during that season.\nIn addition, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, and other related phenomena, which could affect some, or all, of our operations. Our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather events, such as winter storms, flooding and tropical storms and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather events could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and/or export facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression, storage and transportation services and export services. Such extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 75825, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EOG"}
