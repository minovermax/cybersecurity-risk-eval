{"cik": "46195", "company": "BANK OF HAWAII CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions. The risks and uncertainties described below are what management believes are the material risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions\nChanges in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, are expected to lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings.\nOur business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries. Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, public unrest, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.\nThe impacts of various travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and quarantine requirements for visitors to Hawaii has had a dramatic negative impact on tourism. These events have contributed to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which has impacted and will continue to adversely impact us and our customers\u2019 operations. It is uncertain how long these conditions will last or how significant the impacts will be in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.\nRecent deterioration of economic conditions, locally, nationally, and internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues, higher expenses, and lower earnings. In response to this deterioration, several government stimulus programs were initiated, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d). The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor. We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made. The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Hawaii economy and our business, and the extent and severity of the impact on our business and our financial results are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects still cannot be determined with a reasonable level of certainty. We have experienced unprecedented levels of government stimulus in response to COVID-19 in the current economic cycle, the lasting impacts of which are unknown.\nNovel viruses such as COVID-19 increase concerns related to illness when traveling and gathering in large numbers. In response, the majority of the nation\u2019s state and local jurisdictions imposed \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders or similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of COVID-19. Some jurisdictions have re-imposed restrictions after previously lifting them or have delayed further lifting of restrictions. On March 23, 2020, the governor of Hawaii, signed a stay-at-home order and prohibited large gatherings. The order contained exceptions for certain essential activities. Furthermore, the stay-at-home order mandated all individuals arriving or returning to Hawaii by air be subject to a mandatory 10-day self-quarantine.\nThe State of Hawaii\u2019s stay-at-home order was originally set to expire on April 30, 2020, but was extended through May 31, 2020. The order was subsequently changed to a safer-at-home order extended through July 31, 2020. Subsequent orders were issued in August, September, October, November and December of 2020 with different requirements and restrictions for different islands within Hawaii. The stay-at-home order and safer-at-home orders, along with the mandatory 10-day self-quarantine travel restrictions, have resulted in a dramatic decline in tourism in Hawaii. Additionally, tourism has declined as various public events, attractions and venues have been closed or cancelled. We cannot predict when these closures will end and cancellations diminish or when tourism levels in Hawaii will recover. This decline in tourism has, and is expected to continue to have, a negative impact to the Hawaii economy and our financial results.\nThough some of the original restrictions have been relaxed, the mandatory 10-day self-quarantine travel restriction has been extended indefinitely. Beginning October 15, 2020, arriving passengers and interisland travelers may avoid the self-quarantine requirements by providing proof of a recent negative test result for COVID-19 prior to boarding. At this time Oahu is not requiring additional testing upon arrival but other islands are pursuing additional restrictions such as arrival testing. Whether, and by how much, this will increase visitor arrivals and restore the tourism industry in Hawaii is uncertain. In addition, these measures may be lifted or reinstated by the government as the infection rates of COVID-19 in Hawaii change, causing uncertainty and deterring travel to Hawaii.\nTravel restrictions and mandatory quarantines related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a lasting impact on tourism in Hawaii. Because many of our customers, both commercial and consumer, derive at least some of their income from tourism, this dramatic drop in tourism affects them directly, as well as the Hawaii economy as a whole. A downturn in the Hawaii economy and widespread impact to our customers\u2019 income have a negative impact on our operations. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital and liquidity ratios.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, the institution of physical distancing, and shelter-in-place requirements resulted in both temporary and permanent closures of many businesses. As a result, the demand for our products and services has been and may continue to be significantly impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic could prompt credit losses in our loan portfolios and increase our allowance for credit losses, particularly as businesses remain closed and as more customers draw on lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Our operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We have already temporarily or permanently closed certain of our branches and offices and many employees are now working remotely. Though we have re-opened some of our branches, others remain closed. Similarly, though some employees have returned to the office, many continue to work remotely and it is anticipated that staffing levels at our headquarters will remain lower than pre-pandemic levels for some time.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions. Foreclosures and evictions remain suspended. We offered other expanded assistance to customers such as fee waivers, payment deferrals or forbearances on automobile loans and leases, mortgages, home equity loans and lines, as well as commercial, small business and personal loans. We continue to work with our customers as many of the initial assistance programs have been extended or renewed. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios, will depend on the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities, the availability of federal, state, or local funding programs, actions taken by other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, all of which are highly uncertain.\nAny reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.\nThe U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate. The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation. U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital.\nOur earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings. In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers. Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads. If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected.\nCredit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further.\nIncreased credit losses for the Bank could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further. The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities. We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated expected credit losses over the life of the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolios in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses. Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions. Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.\nInability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nConsumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process affect our remedies as a creditor.\nProposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.\nIn addition, Hawaii\u2019s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures. At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which delays the Bank\u2019s ability to take over, preserve, and sell the mortgaged property. The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.\nChanges in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services. Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management. Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments or move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management, thereby decreasing our investment management revenues.\nThe Parent\u2019s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.\nThe Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, dividends on the Parent\u2019s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent\u2019s share repurchase program. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent. The Parent\u2019s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited if federal and state laws and regulations further limit the amount of dividends the Bank is permitted to pay the Parent.\nThere can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.\nDuring 2020, the Parent repurchased 156,358 shares of common stock at a total cost of $14.0 million under its share repurchase program. On March 17, 2020, we suspended share repurchases in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors. The Parent also paid cash dividends of $107.4 million during 2020. In January 2021, the Parent\u2019s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per share on the Parent\u2019s outstanding shares.\nOur dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors. We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Changes\nThe anticipated end of LIBOR on December 31, 2021, may adversely affect our financial instruments that are directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR announced that after December 31, 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. With this announcement there is uncertainty about the continued availability of LIBOR after December 31, 2021 (which may be extended). If LIBOR ceases to be available or the methods of calculating LIBOR change from the current methods, financial products with interest rates tied to LIBOR may be adversely affected. Even if LIBOR remains available it is uncertain whether it will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. We have loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the interest rates on these instruments, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with the same, may be adversely affected. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation.\nThe Company has formed an enterprise-wide, cross-functional project team to oversee the transition. The project team reports to a steering committee as well as Management and the Board on a periodic basis. The project team is organized around key work streams, which cover the products, systems, and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communication. In addition, the project team has completed an inventory of existing LIBOR-indexed products, which is monitored on an ongoing basis, LIBOR fallback language has been added to new loans, and LIBOR-based mortgage ARMs have been removed from our product offering.\nFiscal and Monetary Policy changes may significantly impact our profitability and liquidity\nThe Company\u2019s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies. The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions\u2019 deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry. Although almost all of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, some of the rules have yet to be implemented and others are being interpreted by federal regulators and the courts. The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets. Staff changes to key positions within the CFPB by the Biden administration may result in the CFPB pursuing more strict enforcement policies, similar to that experienced under the Obama administration. Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB. As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements.\nNew laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance. They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.\nBank of Hawaii and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and applicable state regulation and supervision. The bank regulatory scheme is primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. This regulatory framework affects our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes, and proposed changes can be expected from the new federal administration taking office in January 2021. With Democratic control of the White House and both chambers of Congress there may be greater oversight of the banking industry. This may include increased scrutiny of the banking industry\u2019s efforts to provide COVID-19 relief programs as well as consumer financial rights as a whole.\nFurther, leadership and staff changes in regulatory agencies such as the CFPB, CFTC, SEC, and the Treasury Department could lead to changes in the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies. The potential impact of any changes within these agencies cannot be predicted at this time.\nChanges in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.\nUnder Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital. Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.\nCompliance with Basel III resulted in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements. See the \u201cRegulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry\u201d section in MD&A for more information.\nChanges in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results. Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements. These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Business Operations\nA failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access. These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.\nAn interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us. As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.\nOur technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors. Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.\nOur customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent emails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our customers\u2019 devices. These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program. Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue. The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve. In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies\u2019 losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial and reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus making it virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us. The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.\nOur mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.\nOur mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity. Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio. For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.\nOur mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change.\nWe act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored entities (\u201cGSEs\u201d) such as Fannie Mae. As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements. We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements. We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements. Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.\nThe requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities. Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to reserve for credit losses in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any credit allowance recognized will be measured as the difference between the security\u2019s amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security\u2019s lifetime.\nNatural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.\nReal estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways. The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology. Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters. Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans. A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements. A natural disaster could also impact borrowers\u2019 ability to pay their financial obligations, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nCompetition may adversely affect our business.\nOur future depends on our ability to compete effectively. We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and may benefit from tax exemptions or lower tax rates. As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures.\nWe expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services. Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.\nBoth federal and local laws provide mechanisms for out-of-state banks and their holding companies to acquire or open branches in our service territories. Failure to effectively address this competitive risk by competing, innovating and making effective use of new and existing channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information. We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.\nWe are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.\nWe are, from time-to-time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. The outcome of these cases is uncertain. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period. See the Contingencies section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOur performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively. Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense. There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees. Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16548, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BOH"}
