{"cik": "353569", "company": "QUIDEL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOperational and Strategic Risks\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic could adversely affect our business operations, strategy, financial performance and results of operations, the extent of which is uncertain and difficult to predict.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses from government authorities, our business operations, strategy, financial performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022disruptions to our operations, including a shutdown of one or more of our facilities or product lines; restrictions on our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; and interruptions to our research and development, manufacturing, clinical/regulatory and other important business activities;\n\u2022our ability to meet increased demand for our COVID-19 testing products and the costs of expanding our manufacturing capacity to meet such demand;\n\u2022increased costs in our manufacturing, production and shipping processes;\n\u2022a slowdown or stoppage in the supply chain of the raw materials, components, equipment and packaging services used to manufacture our products or our inability to secure additional or alternate sources of supplies or services needed to manufacture our products at optimal levels;\n\u2022our inventory might be requisitioned, diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations. For example, government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected and may in the future affect our supply allocation, and those and our own allocation decisions can impact our customer relationships;\n\u2022interruptions or delays in global shipping to transport and deliver our products to our distributors and customers;\n\u2022interruptions in normal operations of certain end user customers that could result in reductions in demand for routine, elective and other non-COVID-19 related healthcare procedures and testing;\n\u2022limitations on employee resources and availability, including due to sickness or personal quarantine, government restrictions, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, or school closures or remote learning;\n\u2022a COVID-19 vaccination mandate or requirement that unvaccinated employees be tested frequently could result in employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs, including attrition of critically skilled labor, difficulty in obtaining services from impacted suppliers and increased costs;\n\u2022an increase in cyber-attacks given our increased public profile, particularly as a manufacturer of COVID-19 products;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates resulting from market uncertainties;\n\u2022an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility, which could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities, including acquisitions; and\n\u2022an increase in the volatility of our stock price.\nIn response to increased demand brought on by COVID-19, we have rapidly and significantly expanded, and are continuing to expand, our manufacturing capacity, including expanding and scaling our infrastructure to support existing and anticipated COVID-19 testing demand and commercial activities. This rapid expansion has placed and may continue to place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems and financial resources. Failure to successfully manage this expansion could negatively affect our operating results, including due to inefficiencies in implementing such expansion or higher costs for materials, technology, equipment and human capital. Moreover, we may not realize the revenue growth and profitability we anticipate for our COVID-19 and other diagnostic products, which could cause, among other results, a failure to realize the benefits of our manufacturing capacity expansion and the value of those investments being written down or written off. Similarly, the demand for our COVID-19 testing products could decrease if the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, which could result in our having unneeded excess capacity, which could in turn cause the value of those investments to be written down or written off.\nThe pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing many measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, and business and school shutdowns. Although many of these measures have been lifted or relaxed, they could be reinstituted if conditions deteriorate and could be in place for a significant period of time, which could adversely affect our operations. For example, at the outset of the pandemic, we temporarily closed our corporate offices and had personnel work remotely to the extent possible and may be required to do so again in the future. Further, our sales and marketing activities were, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the inability to conduct in-person sales activities, meetings, events and conferences, which could negatively impact the success of our sales and marketing strategies and our relationships with our customers.\nThe effects of COVID-19 may exacerbate our other risk factors described below. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our business operations, strategy, financial performance and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and unpredictable, including, but not limited to, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the severity of continual outbreak surges and variants, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the residual economic and other effects. Because this situation continues to evolve globally, the ultimate impacts to us of COVID-19 are uncertain, but such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, strategy, financial performance and financial condition.\nThe industry and market segment in which we operate are highly competitive, and intense competition with other providers of diagnostic products or services may reduce our sales and margins.\nOur diagnostic tests compete with similar products made by our competitors. There are a large number of multinational and regional competitors making investments in competing technologies and products, including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies. We also face competition from our distributors as some have created, and others may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. A number of our competitors have competitive advantages, such as substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources, and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we have. Moreover, some competitors offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we have. Our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if:\n\u2022our competitors\u2019 products are more effective than ours or take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing;\n\u2022our competitors obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that prevent us from offering competing products or services; or\n\u2022our competitors are able to obtain regulatory approvals for products or services or otherwise bring competing products to market earlier than us.\nIn addition, there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last few years. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry. We expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry.\nIn order to remain competitive and profitable, we must expend considerable resources to research new technologies and products and develop new markets, and there is no assurance our efforts to develop new technologies, products or markets will be successful or such technologies, products or markets will be commercially viable.\nWe devote a significant amount of financial and other resources to researching and developing new technologies, new products and new markets. The development, manufacture and sale of diagnostic products and new technologies require a significant investment of resources, such as employees, offices, manufacturing facilities, and development of new commercial partners and channels. Such expenditures to develop new technologies, products or markets may not lead to commercially viable technology and products or successful markets.\nOur operations will be adversely affected if our operating results do not correspondingly increase with our increased expenditures or if our technology, product and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce new technologies or products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOur operating results are heavily dependent on sales of our COVID-19 and influenza diagnostic tests and if sales or revenues of our COVID-19 or influenza tests decline for any reason, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant percentage of our total revenues come from a limited number of our product families. In particular, revenues from the sale of our COVID-19 and influenza tests represent a significant portion of our total revenues and are expected to remain so for at least the near future. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, sales of our COVID-19 products accounted for 75%, 70% and 0% and influenza products accounted for 4%, 8%, and 26%, respectively, of total revenue. In addition, the gross margins derived from sales of our COVID-19 and influenza tests are significantly higher than the gross margins from many of our other core products. As a result, if sales or revenues of our COVID-19 or influenza tests decline for any reason, whether as a result of a waning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a mild flu season, market share loss or price pressure, obsolescence, regulatory matters, such as loss of EUAs for our COVID-19 products, or any other reason, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected on a disproportionate basis.\nWe rely on a limited number of key distributors that account for a significant portion of our total revenue. The loss of any key distributor or an unsuccessful effort by us to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales.\nAlthough we have many distributor relationships in the US, the market is dominated by a small number of these distributors. Four of our US distributors, collectively accounted for approximately 49%, 68%, and 51% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we rely on a few key distributors for a majority of our international sales and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The loss or termination of our relationship with any of these key distributors could significantly disrupt our business unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales to a distributor are taken up by another distributor. Finding a suitable alternative to a lost or terminated distributor may pose challenges in our industry\u2019s competitive environment, and another suitable distributor may not be found on satisfactory terms, if at all. For instance, some distributors already have exclusive arrangements with our competitors, and others do not have the same level of penetration into our target markets as our existing distributors. If total revenue from any of our other significant distributors were to decrease in any material amount in the future or we are not successful in timely transitioning business from a lost or terminated distributor to one or more new distributors, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers.\nIf our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operating and financial performance deteriorates, our customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us, and our suppliers may reduce or terminate production of products they supply to us. Any inability of customers to pay us, or a reduction or termination of products supplied to us by suppliers, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not achieve market acceptance of our products among physicians, healthcare providers or other customers, and this would have a negative effect on future sales.\nA large part of our current business is based on the sale of rapid POC diagnostic tests. Our future sales depend on, among other matters, capture of sales from central laboratories by achieving market acceptance of POC testing from physicians other healthcare providers or other customers. If we do not capture sales at the levels anticipated in our budget, our total revenue will not be at the levels that we expect and the costs we incur or have incurred may be disproportionate to our sales levels. We expect that clinical reference and hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our POC diagnostic products in order to maintain and expand their existing dominance of the overall diagnostic testing market. Moreover, even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost-effective, save time, or have better performance, physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to POC tests. Our failure to achieve market acceptance from physicians, healthcare providers or other customers with respect to the use of our diagnostic products would have a negative effect on our future sales.\nOur total revenue could be affected by third-party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints.\nThe end-users of our POC products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers. In the US, healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payers, principally private health insurance plans, federal Medicare and state Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure. Use of our products would be adversely impacted if physicians and other healthcare providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products by their patients\u2019 third-party payers. Our total revenue could also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of these governmental or private healthcare payers. We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the US in recent years, currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the US or foreign markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payers may reduce the demand for our products or adversely impact our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. Any reduction in payments by government sponsored or private payers, as a result of budget deficits or reductions in expenditures or for reimbursement reasons, may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nUnexpected increases in, or inability to meet, demand for our products and services could require us to spend considerable resources to meet the demand or harm our reputation and customer relationships if we are unable to meet demand.\nOur inability to meet customer demand for our products and services, whether as a result of manufacturing problems or supply shortfalls, could harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry. In addition, manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our manufacturing facilities. Weather, natural disasters, public health emergencies, fires, terrorism, political change or unrest, failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we experience unexpected increases in the demand for our products or supply shortfalls, we may be required to expend additional capital resources to meet these demands. These capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or even the cost of new manufacturing facilities. This would increase our capital costs, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash resources. If we are unable to develop or obtain necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner, our total revenue could be adversely affected. For example, in response to the demand brought on by COVID-19, we have and are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our manufacturing capacity, which has placed and may continue to place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations and systems. Failure to increase production volumes in a cost-effective manner, lower than anticipated yields or production problems could result in shipment delays, as well as increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nInterruptions in the supply of raw materials, components, equipment and other products and services could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for some of our materials, components, equipment, packaging and other products and services. Some of these supplies and services are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have long-term supply agreements with many of these suppliers, but these long-term agreements involve risks for us, such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials, equipment or components and our reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. It is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver supplies or services to us as agreed. Unexpected increases in demand for our products or supply shortfalls could require us to obtain additional supplies or services in order to manufacture products to meet the demand. Some supplies require significant ordering lead time and we may not be able to timely access sufficient supplies in the event of an unexpected increase in demand or supply shortfall, particularly those obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. For example, government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected our supply allocation and could in the future result in our inventory materials being requisitioned, diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations. In addition, we use third party packaging companies to ship our products to customers. An interruption or delays in the services provided by these third-party packaging companies could also result in a delay of shipments to customers.\nOur business is also subject to risks associated with US and foreign legislation, regulations and trade agreements relating to the materials we import, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import materials used in our products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional US and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost. For example, FDA regulations and labelling requirements may make switching critical suppliers difficult. The SEC also requires disclosure for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals, such as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, that originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and/or adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements has caused and will continue to cause increased costs to comply with these disclosure requirements and may inhibit our ability to source these materials. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials, equipment or components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFailures in our IT and storage systems, including as a result of cyber-security breaches, could significantly disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs.\nWe utilize complex IT systems to transmit and store information, including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information, and otherwise to support our business and process. In the future, our systems may prove inadequate to our business needs and necessary upgrades may not operate as designed, which could result in excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business. In particular, any disruptions, delays or deficiencies from our enterprise resource planning systems could adversely affect our ability to, among other matters, process orders, procure supplies, manufacture and ship products, track inventory, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nOur IT and storage systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate, maintain or access data could result in a material disruption in our operations. Furthermore, a security breach could be facilitated by ineffective protection measures, employee errors or omissions, and malfeasance. Despite our efforts to protect against cyber-attacks and security breaches, hackers and other cyber criminals are using increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving techniques, and we may need to expend substantial additional resources to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to remediate problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our safeguards. In addition, a data security breach or ransomware attack could distract management or other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. If such a breach leads to disclosure of consumer, customer, supplier, partner or employee information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information), it could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with disparate state and foreign breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The costs of maintaining adequate protection against such threats are significant and are expected to continue to increase in the future and may be material to our financial statements.\nInterruptions to our third-party IT service providers and/or the inability of our digital solutions to interoperate with certain operating systems could impair the delivery of our cloud-based solutions and negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host and deliver our cloud-based solutions, such as our QVue Business mobile application, and any interruptions or delays in services from these service providers could impair the delivery of our cloud-based solutions. We do not control the hosting of these solutions, including data center facilities or our or other parties\u2019 access to the Internet. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from weather, natural disasters, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, global pandemics and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of any of these unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions to our cloud-based solutions, which would have a serious adverse impact on our business.\nWe also depend on the interoperability of our mobile applications with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and iOS. Any changes in such systems that degrade the functionality of our digital solutions or give preferential treatment to competitors could adversely affect use of our solutions and negatively impact our business.\nWe face risks relating to our international sales, including inherent economic, political and regulatory risks, that could impact our financial performance, cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our growth strategy.\nOur products are sold internationally, with the majority of our international sales to our customers in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We currently sell and market our products through direct sales, distributor organizations and sales agents. Sales to foreign customers accounted for 17%, 13% and 33% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our international operations are subject to inherent economic, political and regulatory risks, which could impact our financial performance, cause interruptions in our business operations and impede our international growth. These foreign risks include, among others:\n\u2022compliance with multiple different registration requirements and new and changing product registration requirements, our inability to benefit from registration for our products inasmuch as registrations may be controlled by a distributor, and the difficulty in transitioning our product registrations;\n\u2022compliance with complex foreign and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including US laws on import/export limitations, the FCPA, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, could expose us or our employees to fines and criminal sanctions and damage our reputation;\n\u2022tariffs or other barriers as we continue to expand into new countries and geographic regions;\n\u2022exposure to currency exchange fluctuations against the US dollar;\n\u2022longer payment cycles, generally lower average selling prices and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and enforcing agreements with foreign entities;\n\u2022reduced, or lack of, protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights;\n\u2022social, political and economic instability in some of the regions where we currently sell our products or that we may expand into in the future, including as a result of acts of terrorism, health pandemics, natural disasters and disruptions in global transportation;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022complex and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022diversion to the US of our products sold into international markets at lower prices.\nOur international operations are governed by the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws outside the US. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more enforcement proceedings by US and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws, our international operations, which may involve customer relationships with foreign governments, create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations, significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and negatively affect our reputation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated approximately $198.4 million in revenue denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Euro and the Chinese Yuan. Fluctuations in the values of the Euro, the Chinese Yuan, and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContinuing worldwide political and social uncertainty, including tariffs, trade wars or social tensions, may adversely affect our business and prospects, both domestically and internationally.\nPolitical and social uncertainty in the US and throughout the world could impair political, trade and economic relations worldwide. Changes in policy in the US and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could negatively impact our business. US-imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and certain other countries have resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could affect the demand for our products and services and could impact the supply materials we use to manufacture our products.\nNatural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults and exposure to wildfire, which make us susceptible to earthquake and fire risk. An earthquake, fire or other natural disaster or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers or customers is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and fires, power shortages or outages, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending on the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Business Combination\nWe are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the pending Combinations, including, but not limited to, the risks discussed below in this section of the risk factors. For additional information about the pending Combinations and the additional risks and uncertainties related to the Combinations, see Topco\u2019s registration statement on Form S-4, filed with the SEC on January 31, 2022. For information about the defined terms used in this section, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Developments\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nCompletion of the Combinations is subject to certain conditions, some of which are outside of the parties\u2019 control, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Combinations will not be completed.\nThe closing of the Combinations is subject to certain conditions, including (i) our stockholders\u2019 approval of the Quidel Merger and related matters, (ii) Ortho shareholder approval of the Ortho Scheme and related matters, (iii) receipt of clearance from competition and foreign investment authorities in certain areas where the companies operate, (iv) the absence of any law, injunction, order or other judgment prohibiting the Combinations, (v) the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 for the Topco Shares, (vi) receipt of Nasdaq listing approval for the Topco Shares, (vii) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of each of Ortho\u2019s and our representations and warranties in the BCA and performance by each of Ortho and us of the obligations under the BCA and (viii) the sanctioning of the Ortho Scheme by the High Court of Justice of England and Wales (the \u201cCourt\u201d) and the delivery of the order of the Court of sanctioning the Ortho Scheme to the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales.\nThe requirement to satisfy each of the foregoing conditions could delay completion of the Combinations for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. Any delay in completing the Combinations could cause Topco not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect Topco to achieve if the Combinations are successfully completed within the expected timeframe. Further, as a condition to approving the Combinations, governmental authorities may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions on the conduct of our business after the completion of the Combinations. Under the terms of the BCA, the parties are not required to proffer or negotiate, or agree or consent to, any action (including any contractual, behavioral or conduct restriction, agreement, commitment or remedy) that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the BCA) on Topco. Notwithstanding the provisions of the BCA, if we were to become subject to any conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions (whether because such conditions, terms, obligations and restrictions do not rise to the specified level of materiality or because we consent to their imposition), it is possible that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will delay completion of the Combinations or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operations. Furthermore, governmental authorities may require that we divest assets or businesses as a condition to the closing of the Combinations. If we are required to divest assets or businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms or that the governmental authorities will approve the terms of such divestitures. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Combinations will be satisfied or, where applicable, waived or that the Combinations will be completed.\nIn addition, if Ortho has not received the necessary Court and shareholder approvals by September 22, 2022 (subject to certain extension rights), either party may choose not to proceed with the Combinations. The parties may also terminate the BCA under certain specified circumstances, including, among others, in order to enter into an agreement with respect to an all-cash proposal (A) that is determined by our Board, in the case of a proposal to us, or (B) that is determined by the Ortho board of directors, in the case of a proposal to Ortho, to be superior to the BCA, subject to the terms and conditions of the BCA (including a requirement that the terminating party pay a termination fee to the other party in accordance with the BCA).\nFailure to complete the Combinations could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the Combinations are not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the BCA or Ortho shareholders failing to approve the Ortho Scheme, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Combinations, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Ortho a termination fee of approximately $208 million or reimburse Ortho for certain fees and expenses;\n\u2022we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Combinations, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies going forward if the Combinations are not completed;\n\u2022we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and fees associated with the proposed Combinations, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees, regardless of whether the Combinations are completed;\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from our customers, regulators and employees; and\n\u2022matters relating to the Combinations (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Combinations or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the BCA. If the Combinations are not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nThe BCA contains provisions that restrict our ability to pursue alternatives to the Combinations and, in specified circumstances, would require us to pay Ortho a termination fee.\nUnder the BCA, we are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging or facilitating, discussing or negotiating, or furnishing non-public information with regard to, any inquiry, proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal from any person or entity. If we receive a competing acquisition proposal and our Board determines (after consultation with our financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes a Quidel All Cash Superior Proposal (as defined in the BCA), and our Board makes a change in recommendation in response to such proposal to our stockholders, we would be entitled, upon complying with certain requirements, to terminate the BCA, subject to the terms of the BCA. Under such circumstances, we may be required to pay Ortho a termination fee of approximately $208 million or may be required to reimburse Ortho for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the BCA. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if such third party was prepared to enter into a transaction that would be more favorable to us and our stockholders than the Combinations.\nWe will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the Combinations.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring direct and indirect costs associated with the Combinations. These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including payments that may be made to certain of our executives, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. Some of these costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Combinations are completed. There are also processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Combinations and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the Combinations and the other transactions contemplated by the BCA and continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses.\nThere may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Combinations that we may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies and strategic benefits we expect Topco to achieve from the Combinations. Although we expect that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees due to uncertainty associated with the Combinations.\nTopco\u2019s success after completion of the Combinations will depend in part upon the ability of Topco to retain our key employees. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense. Our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about the effect of the Combinations, which may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management, sales, marketing, manufacturing, technical and other personnel prior to and following the Combinations. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Combinations, as our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Topco.\nIn addition, pursuant to severance provisions in our executive employment agreements, certain of our key employees are entitled to receive severance payments upon certain qualifying terminations of their employment. Certain of our key employees potentially could terminate their employment following specified circumstances set forth in the applicable executive employment agreement, including certain changes in such key employees\u2019 title, status, authority, duties, responsibilities or compensation, and be entitled to receive severance. Such circumstances could occur in connection with the Combinations as a result of changes in roles and responsibilities.\nWhile we may employ the use of certain retention programs, there can be no guarantee that they will prove to be successful. If our key employees depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and Topco\u2019s business following the Combinations may be harmed. Furthermore, Topco may be required to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring, training and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to our business, which may adversely affect Topco\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Combinations. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with activities of labor unions or works councils or integrating employees into Topco. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that Topco will be able to attract or retain our key employees to the same extent that we have been able to attract or retain our own employees in the past.\nOur business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Combinations.\nCompanies with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Combinations, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us or Topco. Our business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if the Combinations are not completed, or that of Topco if the Combinations are completed, including an adverse effect on Topco\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Combinations. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Combinations.\nCompletion of the Combinations may trigger change-in-control or other provisions in certain agreements that we are party to.\nThe completion of the Combinations may trigger change-in-control or other provisions in certain agreements that we are party to. If we are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the respective counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the applicable agreements, including in some instances potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we are able to negotiate waivers, the respective counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to the combined business.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to develop and obtain proprietary technology rights; otherwise, we may lose market share or need to reduce prices as a result of competitors selling lower priced or technologically superior products or services that compete with our products.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the diagnostic market depends on continued development and introduction of new proprietary technology and the improvement of existing technology. If we cannot continue to improve upon or develop, obtain and protect proprietary technology, we may lose market share or need to reduce prices as a result of competitors selling lower priced or technologically superior products or services that compete with our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur competitive position is heavily dependent on obtaining and protecting our own proprietary technology or obtaining licenses from others. Our ability to obtain patents and licenses, and their benefits, is uncertain.\n\u2022We have issued patents both in the US and internationally in various countries including, among others, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, various European countries and South Africa. Additionally, we have patent applications pending in the US and various foreign jurisdictions. These pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, or if issued, may not have priority over others\u2019 applications or may not offer meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology or may not otherwise provide commercial value. Moreover, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented in the future. Third parties can make, use and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection.\n\u2022We also license the right to use our products to our customers under label licenses that are for research purposes only. These licenses could be contested and, because we cannot monitor all potential unauthorized uses of our proprietary technology around the world, we might not be aware of an unauthorized use or might not be able to enforce the license restrictions in a cost-effective manner.\n\u2022Our current and future licenses may not be adequate for the operation of our business. In the future, we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products. We may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others that is required to produce our products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nTo protect or enforce our patent rights, it may be necessary for us to initiate patent litigation proceedings against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. These lawsuits would be expensive, take significant time and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In the event that we seek to enforce any of our patents against an infringing party, it is likely that the party defending the claim will seek to invalidate the patents we assert, which could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not being issued. If we pursue any such claim, our claims could fail or the damages or other remedies awarded to us, if any, could hold little to no economic value. Further, these lawsuits may provoke the defendants to assert claims against us, which carries further risk, described in the risk factor below.\nIn addition to our patents, we rely on confidentiality agreements and other similar arrangements with our employees and other persons who have access to our proprietary and confidential information, together with trade secrets and other common law rights, to protect our proprietary and confidential technology. These agreements and laws may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information or in the event that our competitors independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as those in the US. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, if we encounter difficulties or are otherwise unable to effectively protect our intellectual property rights domestically or in foreign jurisdictions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIntellectual property risks and third-party claims of infringement, misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products, require us to redesign our products or attempt to seek licenses from third parties, and materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management and other key employees.\nCompanies in or related to our industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. In developing and producing new products and entering new markets, we may not be able to obtain, at reasonable cost or upon commercially reasonable terms, if at all, licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to be part of such new or existing products. From time to time, we have received, and may continue to receive, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Moreover, we are and have been subject to litigation with parties that claim, among other matters, that we infringed their patents or other intellectual property rights.\nWe have hired and will continue to hire individuals or contractors who have experience in medical diagnostics and these individuals or contractors may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties. These individuals or contractors may use third-party information in connection with performing services for us or otherwise reveal this third-party information to us. For these and other reasons, we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets. Such claims are expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, to the extent that individuals or contractors apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data and may result in litigation.\nThe defense and prosecution of patent and trade secret claims are both costly and time consuming. We or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated their proprietary rights or that may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents. An adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products, limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved with such products may perform for us, increase our costs and expose us to significant liability.\nAs a general matter, our involvement in litigation or in any claims to determine proprietary rights, as may arise from time to time, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations for reasons such as:\n\u2022it may of itself cause our distributors or end-users to reduce or terminate purchases of our products;\n\u2022the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain and a court may find any third-party patent claims valid and infringed by our products (issuing a preliminary or permanent injunction) that would require us to procure costly licensing arrangements from third parties or withdraw or recall such products from the market, redesign such products offered for sale or under development or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise;\n\u2022governmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees, former employees and us relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party\u2019s proprietary rights;\n\u2022an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, special and punitive damages, the opposing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, and future royalty payments significantly affecting our future earnings; and\n\u2022failure to obtain a necessary license (upon commercially reasonable terms, if at all) upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop.\nEven if licenses to intellectual property rights are available, they can be costly. We have entered into various licensing agreements, which largely require payments based on specified product sales and/or the achievement of specific milestones. Royalty and license expenses under these arrangements collectively totaled $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we may also be required to indemnify certain customers, distributors and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another person\u2019s proprietary rights. Further, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors, suppliers or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Our contractors, suppliers and licensors may not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages.\nGovernment and Regulatory Risks\nOur COVID-19 products were approved by the FDA through an EUA and the loss of such authorization could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe FDA can authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved medical product for certain emergency circumstances after the HHS Secretary has made a declaration of emergency justifying authorization of emergency use. An EUA allows use in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by emerging infectious disease threats when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The FDA may also waive otherwise applicable CGMP requirements to accommodate emergency response needs. All of our current COVID-19 products for testing for the COVID-19 virus were obtained under EUAs. EUAs are only effective until the emergency declaration by the HHS Secretary ends and EUAs can also be revised or revoked by the FDA at any time as the FDA continues to evaluate the available data concerning the efficacy and safety of the product, including with respect to whether there exists superior approved products. The loss of one or more of our EUAs for our COVID-19 products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur business and products are highly regulated by various governmental agencies. Our results of operations would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of regulatory approvals, clearances or authorizations, the loss of previously received approvals or other changes to existing laws and regulations that adversely impact our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nThe testing, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the US, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. For example, the FDA regulates most of our products, which are currently all Class I or II devices. Our future performance depends on, among other matters, if, when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval, clearances or authorizations for new products in the US and internationally. Regulatory review can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, making the timing and costs of clearances and approvals difficult to predict. Similarly, conducting clinical studies that may be required for regulatory approvals or clearances is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process, requiring months or years to complete, and our studies are not guaranteed to generate data that demonstrate safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence of the evaluated product.\nIn addition, even after we obtain necessary authorizations, clearances or approvals to market our products, the FDA and other regulatory agencies may require post-market testing and additional surveillance to monitor the performance and use of approved products or may place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of those products. Our results of operations would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of regulatory authorizations, approvals or clearances, changes in laws and regulations, the loss of previously received authorizations, approvals or clearances or the placement of limits on the manufacture, marketing and use of our products. For example, prior to our acquisition of the Triage Business, the Summers Ridge, San Diego manufacturing facility was subject to a 2012 FDA inspection that resulted in an FDA warning letter and recalls of certain Triage meter-based products and revised release specifications for certain Triage meter-based products, which will not be formally closed-out with the FDA until after a future inspection. We cannot assure you that the government will find efforts to resolve the FDA warning letter to be satisfactory. We cannot predict whether other governments\u2019 regulatory authorities will require additional remedial or corrective actions in the future, and the issues arising out of the FDA inspection may be expanded to cover other matters.\nAdditionally, once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the US pursuant to a 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device (similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions). Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.\nWe are also subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the anti-kickback statute, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others to arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices, including our products.\nThe advertising, marketing, and labeling of medical devices is highly regulated by the FDA and FTC. Our efforts to promote our products, including via direct-to-consumer marketing or social media initiatives, could subject us to additional scrutiny of our communication of risk information, benefits or claims, by the FDA, FTC, or both.\nWe must also comply with numerous other laws applicable to billing and payment for healthcare services, including privacy laws. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. In addition, failure by third-party payers to properly process our payment claims in a timely manner could delay our receipt of payment for our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nOur contracts with government entities involve future funding, compliance, and possible sanctions risks.\nDuring 2020, we significantly expanded the number and scope of contracts we entered into with government entities. These contracts involve future funding and compliance risks. These contracts, like our NIH RADx-ATP contract, are subject to risks such as lack of funding or termination and heightened legal compliance requirements, and we may not be able to meet key deliverables and milestones. These contracts might not be renewed or might be terminated for convenience with little or no prior notice. Government contracts may expose us to higher potential liability than do other types of contracts. In addition, government contracts typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting and other requirements. For example, our contracts with the US government generally require us to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulations, FCA, Procurement Integrity Act, Buy American Act and Trade Agreements Act. Government contracts subject us to government audits, investigations and oversight proceedings. Government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements. Implementing policies, procedures and controls relating to the accounting and recordkeeping requirements is expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other concerns. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or we fail an audit, we are subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages, criminal and civil penalties, termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work. These requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. The failure to meet key deliverables, milestones or compliance requirements could harm our reputation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nIf one or more of our products is claimed to be defective, we could be subject to claims of liability and harm to our reputation that could adversely affect our business.\nOur product development and production processes are complex and could expose our products to claims of defectiveness. Alleged manufacturing and design defects could lead to recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or other government authorities) and could result in the removal of one or more of our products from the market. Similarly, our diagnostic products could lead to a false positive or false negative result, affecting the eventual diagnosis or treatment of a patient and could lead to allegations that our products have caused injury or are found to be unsuitable for their intended use. We believe the risk of a product liability claim is heightened for at-home tests that may be purchased and administered by the end user customer and not a medical professional and our communication of risk information, benefits or claims, which is highly regulated by the FTC and FDA could be alleged to be misleading or erroneous. If the FTC or FDA allege or establish that any of our communications are misleading, we could be subject to litigation and material penalties and fines. A defect or claim of a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry. Moreover, any product liability or other claim brought against us, regardless of merit, could be costly to defend.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business that may result in substantial claims against us relating to handling, storage or disposal.\nWe are subject to other substantial regulation relating to environmental, health and safety matters, including occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. Compliance with such laws and regulations requires significant effort and costs. For example, our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials that may be subject to federal statutes commonly known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d), and the Clean Water Act, among other laws and regulations. In addition, if any governmental authorities impose new regulations with additional compliance burdens or alter their interpretation of the requirements of such existing regulations, such regulations could impair our research, development or production efforts by imposing additional, and possibly substantial, costs, restrictions or compliance procedures on our business or operations.\nGiven the nature of the penalties provided for in some of these regulations, we could be required to pay sizable fines, penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance with laws. Any violation or remediation requirement could also partially or completely shut down our research and manufacturing facilities and operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials could lead to exposure of these materials to individuals, which could result in substantial fines, penalties or damages that are not covered by insurance.\nComplying with various US federal, state and foreign privacy and data security laws and privacy requirements from our customers could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nCertain of our digital solutions, such as our QVue Business mobile application, collect, use, process, and store personal or identifying information regarding customers or other end users, and we are subject to privacy and data security laws and regulations that impose obligations in connection with the collection, use, processing and storage of such personal or identifying information. US federal, state and foreign governments and agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in which our customers operate have adopted, are considering adopting or may adopt new privacy and data security laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, processing and storage of information obtained from consumers and other end users, which could impact our ability to offer certain of our digital solutions and services in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, foreign privacy laws impose significant obligations on US companies to protect the personal information of foreign citizens. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Privacy laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, security and other processing of individuals\u2019 information can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Uncertainty and changes in the requirements of multiple jurisdictions may increase the cost of compliance, delay or reduce demand for certain of our digital solutions, restrict our ability to offer certain digital solutions in certain jurisdictions or subject us to sanctions by US federal and state and foreign data protection regulators, all of which could negatively impact our business.\nWe also may be bound by contractual obligations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security that are more stringent than applicable privacy laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, laws, regulations, standards and other contractual obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security are significant. In addition, some companies, particularly larger or global enterprises, often will not contract with vendors that do not meet these rigorous standards and often seek contractual terms to ensure we are financially liable for any breach of laws or regulations.\nIn addition to government actions, privacy advocacy groups, the technology industry and other industries have established or may establish various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by them or third parties, and we may be required or otherwise find it advisable to obtain certain of these certifications or adhere to these standards. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for our solutions and adversely affect our business.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with these privacy and data security laws or privacy requirements may limit or delay the use and adoption of our digital solutions, reduce overall demand for our digital solutions or lead to regulatory investigations, breach of contract claims, litigation or significant fines, penalties or liabilities for actual or alleged noncompliance, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.\nThe US Congress, government agencies in non-US jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d for which the OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions. As a result, the tax laws in the US and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\nIf we are not able to manage our growth strategy or if we experience difficulties identifying or integrating companies or technologies we may acquire, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy contemplates further growth, which we expect to result in expanding the scope of operating and financial systems and the geographical area of our operations, including further expansion outside the US, as new products and technologies are developed and commercialized or new geographical markets are entered. Because we have a relatively small executive team, acquisitions, including the pending Combinations, and other future growth may divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business and place a strain on existing management and our operational, financial and management information systems. Furthermore, we may expand into markets in which we have less experience or incur higher costs. Some of our growth is expected to come from acquisitions of businesses and technologies. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire attractive targets.\nOther risks associated with acquiring other technologies or businesses, including the pending Combinations, include:\n\u2022we may not realize our anticipated benefits and cost savings within our expected time frame, or at all, or may experience unexpected costs and expenditures;\n\u2022difficulties transitioning and integrating the operations of companies or technologies that we acquire with our own operations, including difficulties integrating personnel, information systems, and internal control systems;\n\u2022adverse effects on our existing business relationships;\n\u2022potential loss of management and other key employees of the acquired businesses and inability to attract new employees;\n\u2022potential litigation arising from the acquired business\u2019s operations;\n\u2022potential contractual, regulatory, compliance, intellectual property or employment issues;\n\u2022increased exposure to international operations and sales, including fluctuations in foreign currency; and other economic, political and regulatory risks;\n\u2022write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets or other assets associated with the acquisitions; and\n\u2022inability to obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nWe can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify, complete and integrate strategic acquisitions. Should we encounter difficulties in managing these tasks and risks, our growth strategy may suffer and our revenue, profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTransitioning the BNP Business to Beckman presents certain risks to our business and operations.\nOn October 6, 2017, we acquired the Triage and BNP Businesses from Alere. On July 24, 2021, we entered into agreements with Beckman to transition the BNP Business to Beckman. Pursuant to these agreements, we are obligated to supply to Beckman the antibody that Beckman uses in manufacturing its BNP tests and Beckman is obligated to pay us annual payments (payable quarterly) based on the sales volume of Beckman\u2019s BNP tests, which payments are subject to agreed upon aggregate minimum and maximum amounts per year. These agreements also obligate us to pay to Alere the deferred consideration payable for the BNP Business even if Beckman does not make the guaranteed minimum payments to us, whether as a result of Beckman\u2019s failure to perform under the agreements, our failure to supply the antibody needed to manufacture the BNP tests or otherwise, which presents risks to our business and operations.\nCorporate Finance Risks\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital or operating needs, which could have adverse consequences on our operations and the interests of our stockholders.\nWe may need to seek to raise funds through the issuance of public or private debt or the sale of equity to achieve our business strategy. In addition, we may need debt or equity financing to complete acquisitions, including to fund the cash consideration payable in connection with the Combinations. If we raise funds or acquire other technologies or businesses through issuance of equity, this could dilute the interests of our stockholders. Such financing activities may also depress the market price of shares of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Moreover, the availability of additional capital, whether debt or equity from private capital sources (including banks) or the public capital markets, fluctuates as our financial condition and industry or market conditions in general change. There may be times when the private capital markets and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when we cannot otherwise raise additional capital or issue additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all.\nAdditional indebtedness could be costly or have adverse consequences, such as:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the general economy or our industry and to fluctuations in our operating results, including affecting our ability to comply with and maintain any financial tests and ratios required under our indebtedness;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility to engage in certain transactions or to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the diagnostics industry;\n\u2022putting us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less relative and/or less restrictive debt; and\n\u2022subjecting us to additional restrictive financial and other covenants.\nIf we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on existing indebtedness and our creditworthiness generally. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service or repay our debt. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur debt, deferred and contingent payment obligations could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a $175.0 million Revolving Credit Facility as described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, and may incur other indebtedness from time to time. We currently have no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, but we will continue to have the ability to borrow under the facility. In addition to our Revolving Credit Facility, we will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt. We also have payment obligations for the BNP Business acquisition as described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, as discussed under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Developments\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report, if the Combinations are completed, Ortho\u2019s current net debt of $2.1 billion is expected to continue to be outstanding following the closing of the Combinations.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged and are subject to deferred and contingent payment obligations could have important or materially adverse consequences to our business and operating results, including:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022the payment of our deferred and contingent payment obligations reduces the funds available to us for our operations and other strategic objectives;\n\u2022our debt agreements contain, and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us;\n\u2022our level of indebtedness and deferred and contingent payment obligations may increase our vulnerability to, and reduce our flexibility to respond to, general economic downturns and adverse industry and business conditions;\n\u2022to the extent the debt we incur requires collateral to secure such indebtedness, our assets could be at risk and our flexibility related to such assets could be limited;\n\u2022our debt service and deferred and contingent payment obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022any borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be at variable rates of interest, which may result in higher interest expense in the event of market interest rates; and\n\u2022any default under our Revolving Credit Facility may result in proceedings against collateral we have used to secure such borrowings, including substantially all of our and our guarantor subsidiaries\u2019 assets.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel, including manufacturing, research and development, technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify and hire additional qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, both in the industry in which we operate and where our operations are located. Further, we expect to grow our operations, and our needs for additional management and other key personnel are expected to increase. If we fail to retain existing key personnel, or timely identify and hire replacement or additional qualified personnel to meet expected growth, such failure could adversely impact our business. In addition, the loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key manufacturing, research and development and technical personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operations or strategic objectives.\nWe are subject to, and may in the future become subject to, claims and litigation that could result in significant expenses and could ultimately result in an unfavorable outcome for us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims, commercial disputes and intellectual property claims, as well as regulatory, employment, and other claims related to our business. Litigation related to our company, our business, and our operations or financial performance may also involve customers, competitors, suppliers, patients, shareholders, governmental authorities or other third parties. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in significant settlement amounts, monetary damages, fines or injunctive relief that could affect our financial condition or results of operations. Even if lawsuits do not result in an unfavorable outcome, the costs of defending or prosecuting such lawsuits may be material to our business and our operations. Moreover, these lawsuits may divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, in the ordinary course of business, we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as field corrective actions, product recalls, seizures or injunctions with respect to the sale of our products. The assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and affect our operating results, and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to business risk which, if not covered by insurance, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face a number of business risks, including exposure to product liability claims. Although we maintain insurance for a number of these risks, we may face claims for types of damages, or for amounts of damages, that are not covered by our insurance. For example, there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy. Also, our existing insurance may not be renewed at the same cost and level of coverage as currently in effect or may not be renewed at all. Further, we do not currently have insurance against many environmental risks we confront in our business. If we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, whether arising out of product liability matters, cybersecurity matters, or from some other matter, that claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US and in various non-US jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by US federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-US tax authorities. Due to the potential for changes to tax laws (or changes to the interpretation thereof) and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our foreign operations and intercompany arrangements and other factors, our estimates of income tax assets or liabilities may differ from actual payments, assessments or receipts. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. If we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards, it could also increase our effective tax rate. In addition, any significant change to the tax system in the US or in other jurisdictions could adversely affect our financial statements.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may make takeover attempts difficult, which could depress the price of our common stock and inhibit our stockholders\u2019 ability to receive a premium price for their shares.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our Board to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares without stockholder approval. Any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders, unless such stockholders hold at least 50% of our stock entitled to vote at the meeting. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. These provisions may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us, adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nExpectations of our performance related to ESG matters may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, vendors, employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to ESG factors. Many investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our ESG performance is inadequate. Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports have increased in number to meet growing investor demand for measurement of ESG performance. The criteria by which our corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our performance related to corporate responsibility and ESG matters is inadequate. Moreover, our market capitalization has increased significantly in the last couple of years. Accordingly, we may be benchmarked against larger peer companies, some of which may have more resources than us and thus may have achieved better ESG performance and/or a higher ESG rating profile. We may face reputational damage if our ESG performance or ESG rating profile is, or is perceived as being, below those of our competitors or peer companies. In addition, we could fail, or be perceived as failing, in our achievement of certain ESG-related initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, customers, vendors, employees and other stakeholders related to our ESG performance or our ESG initiatives are not executed as planned, it could adversely affect our reputation, business, stock price, financial condition or results of operation.", "PERMNO": 76591, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "QDEL"}
