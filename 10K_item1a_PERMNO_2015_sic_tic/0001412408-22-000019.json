RISK FACTORS\nRisk factors\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and industry is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\u201d section of Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, perhaps significantly. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks relating to our business and industry\nWe have grown rapidly in recent periods, and as a result, our expenses have continued to increase. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our revenue may not increase, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods, which puts strain on our business, operations and employees. We anticipate that our operations will continue to rapidly expand. As we continue to grow, both organically and through acquisitions, we must effectively integrate, develop, and manage an increasingly distributed employee base in a fully remote working environment. We may find it challenging to maintain the same level of employee productivity while executing our growth plan, fostering collaboration, and maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture, and any such failures could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees and to achieve our business objectives.\nIn addition, to manage our current and anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our IT infrastructure, financial and accounting systems and controls and continue to build our qualified work force in key areas of our company. A key element of how we manage our growth is our ability to scale our capabilities and satisfactorily implement our solution for our clients\u2019 needs. Our healthcare services clients often require specific features or functions unique to their organizational structure, which, at a time of significant growth or during periods of high demand, may strain our implementation capacity and hinder our ability to successfully implement our solution to our clients in a timely manner. If we are unable to address the needs of our healthcare services clients or our healthcare services clients are unsatisfied with the quality of our solution or services due to our inability to manage our rapid growth, they may not renew their contracts, seek to cancel or terminate their relationship with us or renew on less favorable terms, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nFailure to effectively manage our growth could also lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, financial losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees. In addition, our growth has required and is expected to require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new applications and services. We may also need to make further investments in our technology and automate portions of our solution or services to decrease our costs. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our revenue may not increase (including sufficiently to offset our expenses) or may grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, including with the EHR and PM systems with which we integrate, our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nThe market for our products and services is fragmented, competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, evolving regulatory requirements, changes in client needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities, including the EHR and PM systems with which we integrate. As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we currently possess.\nIn order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects to compete with new market entrants by developing new services, growing our client base and penetrating new markets. These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of acceptance by our clients.\nOur success is dependent upon continued ability to maintain a network of qualified healthcare services clients. If we are unable to recruit and retain qualified healthcare services clients, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to grow and would adversely affect our results of operations. In any particular market, healthcare groups and professionals could demand higher payments, develop competing products and/or services or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less attractive service for our clients and the patients that they serve, direct competition from our existing clients, or find difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements.\nOur success also depends on providing high-quality products and services that healthcare services clients use to improve clinical, financial and operational performance that are used and positively received by patients. If we cannot adapt to rapidly evolving industry standards and technology and increasingly sophisticated and varied\nhealthcare services organization and patient needs, our existing technology could become undesirable, obsolete or harm our reputation.\nWe believe demand for our products and services has been driven in large part by increasing patient responsibility, engagement and consumerism, high deductible health plans and declining reimbursements. Our ability to streamline the intake process and critical workflows in order to improve healthcare services organization and staff efficiency and patient engagement to allow for optimal allocation of resources will be critical to our business. Our success also depends on the ability of our Platform to increase patient engagement, and our ability to demonstrate the value of our Platform to healthcare services clients, patients and life sciences companies. If our existing clients do not recognize or acknowledge the benefits of our Platform or our Platform does not drive patient engagement, then the market for our products and services might develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, as we and the EHR and PM solutions with which we integrate, grow and expand product offerings, the EHR and PM solutions with which we integrate could offer more competitive services. Some of these EHR and PM systems offer, or may begin to offer, services, including patient intake and engagement services, payment processing tools, and targeted patient communication services, in the same or similar manner as we do. Although there are many potential opportunities for, and applications of, these services, these EHR and PM systems may seek opportunities or target new clients in areas that may overlap with those that we have chosen to pursue. Such competition from these EHR and PM systems may adversely affect our business, market share and results from operations.\nWe compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvement through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition, price and the ability to integrate our Platform solutions with various PM and EHR systems and other technology. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and significantly greater resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace. Accordingly, new competitors or providers of PM and EHR solutions may emerge that have greater market share, larger client bases, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We also may be subject to pricing pressures as a result of, among other things, competition within the industry, consolidation of healthcare industry participants, practices of managed care organizations, government action and financial stress experienced by our clients. If our pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business will be less profitable and our results of operations will be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our current clients or expand our client base in this competitive environment. If we do not retain current clients or expand our client base, or if we have to renegotiate existing contracts, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the healthcare information technology and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could also adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past and we may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. For the years ended January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had net losses of $118.2 million and $27.3 million, respectively, and losses from operations of $116.8 million and $25.7 million, respectively. Our operating expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to grow our business and build relationships with our clients and partners, develop the Phreesia Platform, develop new solutions and operate as a public company. In addition, to the extent we are successful in increasing our client base, we could incur increased losses because significant costs associated with entering into client agreements are generally incurred up front, while revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financings in order to fund our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks and difficulties as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nOur operating results have in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly and if we fail to meet the\nexpectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022the extent to which our services achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022our ability to introduce new services and enhancements to our existing services on a timely basis;\n\u2022new competitors and the introduction of enhanced products and services from new or existing competitors;\n\u2022the length of our contracting and implementation cycles;\n\u2022the financial condition of our current and potential clients;\n\u2022our ability to integrate our Platform with the systems, utilized by our healthcare services clients, including but not limited to, EHR and PM systems;\n\u2022changes in client budgets and procurement policies;\n\u2022amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities and other areas of our business;\n\u2022technical difficulties or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, including the rate of expansion of our sales force;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment related to healthcare;\n\u2022regulatory compliance costs;\n\u2022the timing, size and integration success of potential future acquisitions;\n\u2022unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs; and\n\u2022buying patterns of our clients and the related seasonality impacts on our business.\nMany of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nA significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls may decrease our margins and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns have harmed and may continue to harm our business and increase our costs and expenses.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions or global health concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially changed how we and our customers operate our businesses, including our company\u2019s shift to a fully remote work environment. The pandemic has and may continue to materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations due to, among other factors:\n\u2022a general decline in business activity, including the impact of our clients\u2019 office closures earlier in the pandemic;\n\u2022the potential for closures and restrictions to be re-implemented as a result of certain locations continuing to experience renewed outbreaks and surges in infection rates, the emergence of new variants, and difficulties with vaccine distribution;\n\u2022a disproportionate impact on the healthcare services clients with whom we contract;\n\u2022disruptions to our supply chains and our third-party vendors, partners, and suppliers;\n\u2022difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets, or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions that could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis;\n\u2022the potential negative impact on the health or productivity of employees, especially if a significant number of them are impacted;\n\u2022a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption; and\n\u2022social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate.\nIn addition, market volatility and economic uncertainty remain widespread, making it potentially very difficult for our clients and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. During challenging economic times, our\nclients and patients may have difficulty gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us and adversely affect our revenue. If that were to occur, our financial results could be harmed. Further, challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our clients to pay for the applications and services they already have purchased from us and, as a result, our write-offs of accounts receivable could increase.\nPrivacy concerns or security breaches relating to our Platform could result in economic loss, damage to our reputation, deterring users from using our products, and our exposure to legal penalties and liability.\nWe collect, process and store significant amounts of sensitive, confidential and proprietary information, including personally identifiable information, such as payment data and protected health information, of patients received in connection with the utilization of our Platform by patients of our healthcare services clients and life sciences clients. While we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect such data, techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate such techniques or implement adequate preventative measures to avoid unauthorized access or other adverse impacts to such data or our systems. In addition, some of our third-party service providers and partners also collect and/or store our sensitive information and our clients' data on our behalf, and these service providers and partners are subject to similar threats of cyber attacks and other malicious internet-based activities, which could also expose us to risk of loss, litigation, and potential liability.\nWe may be subject to state laws requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Furthermore, certain health privacy laws, data breach notification laws, consumer protection laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our business and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our collection, use and dissemination of individuals\u2019 health information. Patients about whom we obtain health information, as well as the healthcare services clients who share this information with us, may have statutory or contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights, violated applicable privacy laws and regulations or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nLike all internet services, our service is vulnerable to software bugs, computer viruses, internet worms, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload servers with denial-of-service, or other attacks or similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our and third-party computer systems, any of which could lead to system interruptions, delays, or shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized access of data. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our products, or failure to prevent software bugs, to the satisfaction of our clients or the health and safety of their patients, such events may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients, and negatively affect our clients and their patients. We have in place systems and processes that are designed to protect our data, prevent data loss, disable undesirable accounts and activities on our Platform and prevent or detect security breaches, however, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security.\nFurther, the security systems in place at our employees\u2019 and service providers\u2019 offices and homes may be less secure than those used in our offices, and while we have implemented technical and administrative safeguards to help protect our systems as our employees and service providers work from their offices, homes and other remote locations, we may be subject to increased cybersecurity risk, which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, and could disrupt our business operations. There is no guarantee that the data security and privacy safeguards we have put in place will be completely effective or that we will not encounter risks associated with employees and service providers accessing company data and systems remotely. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs to our systems or a third party\u2019s systems, we also could be required to expend significant resources to mitigate the breach of security, pay any applicable fines and address matters related to any such breach, including notifying users or regulators, and address reputational harm.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of\ninternal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2021, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we had deficiencies in our internal controls\nover several areas, including segregation of duties and review and approval of manual journal entries. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. These material weaknesses have been fully remediated, but we may in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIf additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nWe typically incur significant upfront costs in our client relationships, and if we are unable to develop or grow these relationships over time, we are unlikely to recover these costs and our operating results may suffer.\nWe devote significant resources to establish relationships with new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. Our efforts involve educating our clients and patients about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our products and services. We do not provide access to the Platform and do not charge fees during this initial sales period. For clients that decide to enter into a contract with us, most of these contracts may provide for a preliminary trial period where a subset of healthcare services locations from the client is granted access to our Platform. Following any such trial period, we aim to increase the number of healthcare services locations within the client that utilize the Platform. Accordingly, our operating results depend in substantial part on our ability to deliver a successful client and patient experience and persuade our clients and patients to grow their relationship with us over time. As we expect to grow rapidly, our client acquisition costs could outpace revenue growth, and we may be unable to reduce our total operating costs through economies of scale such that we are unable to achieve profitability. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays, including delays caused by factors outside of our control, could cause our operating results to suffer.\nAs a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles, we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results.\nThe sales cycle for our services can be variable, typically ranging from three to six months from initial contact to contract execution. During the sales cycle, we expend time and resources, and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures. Our implementation cycle is also variable, typically ranging from one to 24 months from contract execution to completion of implementation. The variability of our sales and implementation cycle is dependent on numerous factors, including the discretionary nature of potential clients' purchasing and budget decisions and the size and complexity of the applicable client. Some of our new-client set-up projects are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work, including to educate prospective clients about the uses and benefits of our Platform. Each customer\u2019s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities. During the implementation cycle, we expend substantial time, effort and financial resources implementing our service, but\naccounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented, at which time we begin recognition of subscription and related implementation revenue over the life of the contract. This could harm our future operating results. Despite the fact that we typically require a deposit in advance of implementation for our larger clients, some clients have cancelled before our service has been started. In addition, we may not recognize revenue due to variable contract start dates, and implementation may be delayed or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future for a variety of reasons. If implementation periods are extended, our revenue cycle will be delayed and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort and expenses invested in the cancelled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time.\nThese factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low. As a result, in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease.\nThe growth of our business relies, in part, on the growth and success of our clients and certain revenues from our engagements, which is difficult to predict and is subject to factors outside of our control.\nWe enter into agreements with our healthcare services clients, under which a significant portion of our fees are variable, including fees which are dependent upon the number of add-on features to the Phreesia Platform subscribed for by our clients and the number of patients utilizing our payment processing tools. If there is a general reduction in spending by healthcare services organizations on healthcare technology solutions, it may result in a reduction in fees generated from our healthcare services clients or a reduction in the number of add-on features subscribed for by our healthcare services clients. This could lead to a decrease in our revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the number of patients utilizing our payment processing tools, and the amounts those patients pay directly to our healthcare services clients for services, is often impacted by factors outside of our control, such as the number of patients with high deductible health plans. Accordingly, revenue under these agreements can be uncertain and unpredictable. If the number of patients utilizing our payment systems, or the aggregate amounts paid by such patients directly to our healthcare services clients through the Phreesia Platform, were to be reduced by a material amount, such decrease would lead to a decrease in our revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also generate revenue through fees charged to our life sciences clients by delivering targeted messages to patients who opt-in to such communications. The growth of our life sciences revenue stream is driven, in part, by our ability to grow our network of healthcare services clients and available population of patients to target, our ability to achieve adequate patient opt-in rates, the number of newly approved drugs and the success of newly launched drugs, each of which is impacted by factors outside of our control. If there is a reduction in newly approved drugs, or newly launched drugs are not successful, this could negatively affect the ability of our life sciences clients to deliver relevant, targeted messages to patients who would have otherwise been candidates to receive such drugs, and accordingly may reduce patient opt-in rates. A reduction in the available population of patients to target or a decline in patient opt-in rates could lead to a decrease in our life sciences revenues, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our existing clients are not satisfied with our services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe depend on our existing clients\u2019 satisfaction with our products and services. We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of existing clients\u2019 contracts and sales of additional applications and services to existing clients. As part of our growth strategy, we have recently focused on expanding our services amongst current clients. As a result, achieving a high client retention rate, expanding within clients and selling additional applications and services are critical to our future business, revenue growth and results of operations. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our relationships with existing clients and the patients that they serve and to our ability to attract new clients. The promotion of our brand may require us to make substantial investments, and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these marketing initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. In addition, the loss or dissatisfaction of any client could substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit widespread adoption of our solution and impair our ability to attract new clients.\nFactors that may affect our client satisfaction and our ability to sell additional applications and services include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the price, performance and functionality of our Platform;\n\u2022patient acceptance and adoption of services and utilization of our payment processing tools;\n\u2022the availability, price, performance and functionality of competing solutions;\n\u2022our ability to develop and sell complimentary applications and services;\n\u2022the stability, performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services;\n\u2022changes in healthcare laws, regulations or trends;\n\u2022the business environment of our clients including healthcare staffing shortages and headcount reductions by our clients and\n\u2022our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition.\nWe typically enter into annual contracts with our clients, which have a stated initial term of one year and automatically renew for one-year subsequent terms. Most of our clients have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our Platform solution after the initial term expires. In addition, our clients may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal, which may reduce our revenue from these clients and may decrease our annual revenue. If our clients fail to renew their contracts, renew their contracts upon less favorable terms or at lower fee levels or fail to purchase new products and services from us, our revenue may decline or our future revenue growth may be constrained. Should any of our clients terminate their relationship with us after implementation has begun, we would not only lose our time, effort and resources invested in that implementation, but we would also have lost the opportunity to leverage those resources to build a relationship with other clients over that same period of time.\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our target market are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be impacted and our business would be harmed.\nMarket estimates and growth forecasts that we disclose are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of the market for our services may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Accordingly, any forecasts of market growth that we disclose should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nThe principal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include the number of healthcare services organizations currently taking appointments, the amount of annual out of pocket consumer spend for healthcare-related services, and the amount of annual spend by life sciences companies on digital patient engagement at the point of care. Our market opportunity is also based on the assumption that the strategic approach that our solution enables for our potential clients will be more attractive in creating efficiencies in patient care than competing solutions.\nIf these assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot implement our solution for clients or resolve any technical issues in a timely manner, we may incur costs in the form of service credits or other remedial steps and/or lose clients, and our reputation may be harmed.\nOur clients utilize a variety of data formats, applications and infrastructure and our solution must support our clients\u2019 data formats. Furthermore, the healthcare industry has shifted towards digitalized record keeping, and accordingly, many of our healthcare services clients have developed their own software, or utilize third-party software, for practice management and secure storage of electronic medical records. Our ability to develop and maintain logic-based and scalable technology for patient intake management and engagement and payment processing that successfully integrates with our clients\u2019 software systems for practice management and storage of electronic medical records is critical. If our Platform does not currently support a client\u2019s required data format or appropriately integrate with clients\u2019 systems, then we must configure our Platform to do so, which could increase our expenses. Additionally, we do not control our clients\u2019 implementation schedules. As a result, if our clients do not allocate the internal resources necessary to meet their implementation responsibilities or if we face unanticipated implementation difficulties, the implementation may be delayed. If the client implementation process is not executed successfully or if execution is delayed, we could incur significant costs, clients could become dissatisfied and decide not to increase utilization of our solution or not to implement our solution beyond an initial period prior to their term commitment or, in some cases, revenue recognition could be delayed. In addition, competitors with more efficient operating models with lower implementation costs could jeopardize our client relationships.\nOur clients and patients depend on our support services to resolve any technical issues relating to our solution and services, and we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for support services, particularly as we increase the size of our client bases (including healthcare services clients and the number of patients that they serve). We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. It is difficult to predict client and patient demand for technical support services, and if client or patient demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our clients. Further, if we are unable to address the needs of our clients and their patients in a timely fashion or further develop and enhance our solution, or if a client or patient is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the technical support services rendered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation or be required to issue credits or refunds for amounts related to unused services, and our profitability may be impaired and clients\u2019 or patients\u2019 dissatisfaction with our solution could damage our ability to expand the number of applications and services purchased by such clients. These clients may not renew their contracts, seek to terminate their relationships with us or renew on less favorable terms. Moreover, negative publicity related to our client and patient relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our reputation or ability to compete for new business with current and prospective clients. If any of these were to occur, our revenue may decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe historically derive a significant portion of our revenues from our largest clients.\nHistorically, we have relied on a limited number of clients for a substantial portion of our total revenue and accounts receivable. The sudden loss of any of our larger clients, or the renegotiation of any of their contracts on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our operating results. Because we rely on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our revenues, we depend on the creditworthiness of these clients. If the financial condition of our larger clients declines, our credit risk could increase. Should one or more of our significant clients declare bankruptcy, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable and affect our bad debt reserves and net income.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. We expect regulatory and economic conditions to result in additional consolidation in the healthcare industry in the future. As consolidation accelerates, the economies of scale of our clients\u2019 organizations may grow. If a client experiences sizable growth following consolidation, it may determine that it no longer needs to rely on us and may reduce its demand for our products and services. In addition, as healthcare services organizations and life sciences companies consolidate to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power, these healthcare services organizations may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our products and services. Finally, consolidation may also result in the acquisition or future development by our healthcare services clients and life sciences clients of products and services that compete with our products and services. Any of these potential results of consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our senior management team and certain key employees, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our founders, Chaim Indig (Chief Executive Officer) and Evan Roberts (Chief Operating Officer), and senior management team and other key personnel. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. In addition, our shift to a remote work environment could make it increasingly difficult to manage our business and adequately oversee our employees and business functions, potentially resulting in harm to our company culture, increased employee attrition, and the loss of key personnel.\nIn addition, we must attract, train and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees, including sales and marketing personnel, client support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel and management personnel, and the availability of such personnel, in particular software engineers, may be constrained. We also believe that our future growth will depend on the continued development of our direct sales force and its ability to obtain new clients and to manage our existing client base. If we are unable to hire and\ndevelop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, sales of our services will suffer and our growth will be impeded.\nCompetition for qualified management and employees in our industry is intense, and identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. Many of the companies with which we compete for personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do. While we have entered into offer letters or employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, all of our employees are \u201cat-will\u201d employees, and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason and without notice, subject, in certain cases, to severance payment rights. The departure and replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business. In addition, volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may affect our ability to attract replacement should key personnel depart.\nWe may make future acquisitions and investments which may be difficult to integrate, divert management resources, result in unanticipated costs or dilute our stockholders.\nWe have in the past acquired, and we may in the future acquire or invest in, businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities.\nThere are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions, and the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of these or any future acquisitions. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022difficulty integrating the purchased operations, products or technologies and maintaining the quality and security standards consistent with our brand;\n\u2022the need to integrate or implement additional controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022our inability to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the acquired business;\n\u2022assimilation of the acquired businesses, which may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business;\n\u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition;\n\u2022the loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired operations;\n\u2022difficulty retaining or developing the acquired business\u2019 customers;\n\u2022adverse effects on our existing business relationships;\n\u2022failure to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits or the strategic benefits of the acquisitions, including failure to consummate any proposed or contemplated transaction; and\n\u2022liabilities from the acquired businesses for infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims and failure to obtain indemnification for such liabilities or claims.\nAcquisitions also increase the risk of unforeseen legal liability, including for potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses which are not discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Even if we are successful in completing and integrating an acquired business, it may not perform as we expect or enhance the value of our business as a whole.\nCertain of our operating results and financial metrics, including the key metrics included in this report, may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality.\nWe believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause us to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others. We believe this variability is largely due to our focus on the healthcare industry. For example, with respect to our healthcare services clients, we receive a disproportionate increase in payment processing revenue from such clients during the first two to three months of the calendar year relative to the other months of the year, which is driven, in part, by the resetting of patient deductibles at the beginning of each calendar year. Sales for our life sciences solutions are also seasonal, primarily due to the annual spending patterns of our clients. This portion of our sales is usually the highest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. While we believe we have visibility into the seasonality of our business, our rapid growth rate over the last several years may have made\nseasonal fluctuations more difficult to detect. If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nOur business and growth strategy depend on our ability to maintain and expand a network of healthcare services clients. If we are unable to do so, our future growth would be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur success is dependent upon our continued ability to maintain a network of qualified healthcare services clients. If we are unable to recruit and retain qualified healthcare services clients, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to grow and would adversely affect our results of operations. In any particular market, healthcare groups and professionals could demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less attractive service for our clients and the patients that they serve or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. Our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified healthcare groups and professionals also may be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as changes in Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement levels and other pressures on healthcare services organizations and consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and healthcare services organizations. The failure to maintain or to secure new cost-effective client contracts may result in a loss of or inability to grow our client base, higher costs, healthcare services organization network disruptions, less attractive service for our clients and/or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing industry. Accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor and manage all risks our business encounters. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not successful in identifying and mitigating all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer uninsured liability, harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to limit our liabilities by contract or through insurance may be ineffective or insufficient to cover our future liabilities.\nWe attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages arising from our negligence, errors, mistakes or security breaches. Contractual limitations on liability, however, may not be enforceable or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages and we are not always able to negotiate meaningful limitations. We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for cyber security and errors and omissions. It is possible, however, that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nWe may become subject to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to litigation in the future. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which we are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to defend ourselves vigorously; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers.\nRisks relating to our payments business\nOur payments platform is a core element of our business. If our payments platform is limited, restricted, curtailed or degraded in any way, or if we fail to continue to grow and develop our payments platform, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur payments platform is a core element of our business. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, our payments platform generated 31% of our total revenue. Our future success depends in part on the continued growth and development of our payments platform. If such activities are limited, restricted, curtailed or degraded in any way, or if we fail to continue to grow and develop our payments platform, our business may be materially and adversely affected. The utilization of our payment processing tools may be impacted by factors outside of our control, such as disruptions in the payment processing industry generally. If the number of patients utilizing our payments platform, or the aggregate amounts paid by such patients directly to our healthcare services clients through our payments platform, were to be reduced as a result of disruptions in the payment processing industry or other factors, it could result in a decrease to our revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some potential or existing clients may not desire to use our payment processing services or to switch from their existing payment processing vendors for a variety of reasons, such as transition costs, business disruption, and loss of accustomed functionality. There can be no assurance that our efforts to overcome these factors will be successful, and this resistance may adversely affect our growth.\nThe attractiveness of our payment processing services may also depend on our ability to integrate emerging payment technologies, including crypto-currencies, other emerging or alternative payment methods, and credit card systems that we or our processing partners may not adequately support or for which we or they do not provide adequate processing rates. In the event such methods become popular among consumers, any failure to timely integrate emerging payment methods (such as ApplePay) into our software, anticipate client behavior changes, or contract with payment processing partners that support such emerging payment technologies could reduce the attractiveness of our payment processing services, potentially resulting in a corresponding loss of revenue.\nIncreases in card network fees and other changes to fee arrangements may result in the loss of clients who use our payment processing services or a reduction in our earnings.\nFrom time to time, card networks, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover, increase the fees that they charge acquirers, which would be passed down to processors, payment facilitators and merchants. We could attempt to pass these increases along to our clients, but this strategy might result in the loss of clients to competitors who do not pass along the increases. If competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees to our clients in the future, we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases, which may increase our operating costs and reduce our earnings.\nIf we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of card networks, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our payment facilitator status. If our clients or sales partners incur fines or penalties that we cannot collect from them, we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties.\nWe provide a payments solution for the secure processing of patient payments. Our payment processing tools can connect to multiple clearinghouses and can also connect directly with patients. We have developed partnerships with primary credit card processors in the United States to facilitate payment processing, and we are registered with Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and other card networks as service providers for acquiring member institutions. These card networks set the operating rules and standards with which we must comply. The termination of our status as a certified service provider, a decision by the card networks to exclude payment facilitators or bar us from serving as such, or any changes in network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of the operating rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our clients or partners, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs such, we and our clients are subject to card network rules that could subject us or our clients to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by card networks for certain acts or omissions by us. The rules of card networks are set by their boards, which may be influenced by card issuers. Many banks directly or indirectly sell processing services to clients in direct competition with us. These banks could attempt, by virtue of their influence on the networks, to alter the networks\u2019 rules or policies to the detriment of non-members including our businesses. If a client or sales partner fails to comply with the applicable requirements of card networks, it could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by card networks. If we cannot collect processing fees from the\napplicable client, we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties, resulting in lower earnings for us. The termination of our registration, including a card network barring us from acting as a payment facilitator, or any changes in card network rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop providing payment processing services relating to the affected card network, which would adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to interchange fees on payment card transactions would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nA provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") known as the Durbin Amendment empowered the Federal Reserve Board, (\"FRB\"), to establish and regulate a cap on the interchange fees that merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit card transactions. The final rule implementing the Durbin Amendment established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions, and it established a maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction, limiting the fee revenue to debit card issuers and payment processors. HSA-linked payment cards are currently exempt from the rule, assuming the card is the only means of access to the underlying funds (except when all remaining funds are provided to the cardholder in a single transaction). The FRB is empowered to issue amendments to the rule, or a state or federal legislative body could enact new legislation, which could change the scope of the current rule and the basis upon which interchange rate caps are calculated. The FRB is currently revisiting the rule and has proposed changes to the rule. While the currently proposed changes would not remove the exemption for HSA-linked payment cards, the final rule that is issued by the FRB could differ from the currently proposed rule. To the extent that HSA-linked payment cards and other exempt payment cards used on our Platform (or their issuing banks) lose their exempt status under the current rules or if the current interchange rate caps applicable to other payment cards used on our Platform are increased, any such amendment, rule making, or legislation could impact interchange rates applicable to payment card transactions processed through our Platform. As a result, this could decrease our revenue and profit and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk relating to our data and intellectual property\nIf our intellectual property is not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition, protect our technology and products, and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on proprietary technology and content, including software, databases, confidential information and know-how, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade-secret and copyright laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology, content and brand. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional trademark, patent and other intellectual property filings that could be expensive and time-consuming. Effective trademark, trade-secret and copyright protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. These measures, however, may not be sufficient to offer us meaningful protection. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our brand, competitive position and business could be harmed, as third parties may be able to dilute our brand or commercialize and use technologies and software products that are substantially the same as ours without incurring the development and licensing costs that we have incurred. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise provide us with competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain offerings or other competitive harm.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our competitors\u2019 products and services, and may in the future seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement. However, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Any inability to meaningfully protect our intellectual property rights could result in harm to our brand or our ability to compete and reduce demand for our technology and products. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities. Also, some of our products and services rely on technologies and software developed by or licensed from third parties. Any disruption or disturbance in such third-party products or services, which we have experienced in the past, could interrupt the operation of our Platform. We may not be able\nto maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may also be required to protect our proprietary technology and content in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful, or which we may not pursue in every location. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country, and the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States and elsewhere, and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage. Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe may use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code, which could include valuable proprietary code of the user, on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nAny restrictions on our use of, or ability to license, data, or our failure to license data and integrate third-party technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon licenses from third parties for some of the technology and data used in our applications, and for some of the technology platforms upon which these applications are built and operate. We expect that we may need to obtain additional licenses from third parties in the future in connection with the development of our products and services. In addition, we obtain a portion of the data that we use from government entities, public records and our partners for specific partner engagements. We believe that we have all rights necessary to use the data that is incorporated into our products and services. However, we cannot assure you that our licenses for information will allow us to use that information for all potential or contemplated applications and products. In addition, certain of our products depend on maintaining our data and analytics platform, which is populated with data disclosed to us by healthcare services clients, life sciences companies and their respective patients and other partners with their consent. If these clients, patients or partners revoke their consent for us to maintain, use, de-identify and share this data, consistent with applicable law, our data assets could be degraded.\nIn the future, data providers could withdraw their data from us or restrict our usage for any reason, including if there is a competitive reason to do so, if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data or if judicial interpretations are issued restricting use of the data that we currently use in our products and services. In addition, data providers could fail to adhere to our quality control standards in the future, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. If a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw or restrict their data, or if they fail to adhere to our quality control standards, and if we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings, our ability to provide products and services to our partners would be materially adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also integrate into our proprietary applications and use third-party software to maintain and enhance, among other things, content generation and delivery, and to support our technology infrastructure. Some of this software is proprietary and some is open source software. Our use of third-party technologies and open source software exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our\ninability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. These technologies may not be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could be difficult to replace once integrated into our own proprietary applications. Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Our inability to obtain, maintain or comply with any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. If our data suppliers choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future, we might not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize our services and use our proprietary technology without infringing the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. As the market for healthcare in the United States expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Whether merited or not, we may face allegations that we, our partners, our licensees or parties indemnified by us have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. We may also face allegations that our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former employers or other third parties. It may be necessary for us to initiate litigation to defend ourselves in order to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or to establish our respective rights. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have merit, such claims can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and financial resources and can be costly to evaluate and defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop commercializing or using our products or technology, obtain licenses, modify our services and technology while we develop non-infringing substitutes or incur substantial damages, settlement costs or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products and services. If we require a third-party license, it may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products and services. We may also have to redesign our products or services so they do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which our technology and products may not be available for commercialization or use. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not obtain a third-party license to the infringed technology, license the technology on reasonable terms or obtain similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. We are not currently subject to any claims from third parties asserting infringement of their intellectual property rights. Some third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Moreover, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. Assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively deliver our products and services, which could cause us to lose clients and harm our operating results.\nOur business depends on the continuing operation of our technology infrastructure and systems. Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter technical obstacles in enhancing our existing software and developing new software, and it is possible that we may discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary applications from operating properly. In addition, any damage to or failure of our existing systems could result in interruptions in our ability to deliver our products and services. Interruptions in our service could reduce our revenue and profits, and our reputation could be damaged if people believe our systems are unreliable.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, political unrest (such as the current Ukrainian crisis with Russia) floods, fires, power loss, break-ins, hardware or software failures, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems and similar events. Any unscheduled interruption in our service would result in an immediate loss of revenue. Frequent or persistent system failures that result in the unavailability of our Platform or slower response times could reduce our clients\u2019 ability to access our Platform, impair our delivery of our products and services and harm the perception of our Platform as reliable, trustworthy and consistent. Our insurance policies provide only limited coverage for service interruptions and may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems.\nIf our services fail to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of our service is associated with errors or malfunctions, we could have liability to clients or patients which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur software, content and services are used to assist medical groups, health systems and payers with managing the patient intake process and to empower patients and healthcare organizations as they navigate the challenges of an evolving healthcare system. If our software, content or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with errors or malfunctions, then healthcare services clients or patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us, harm our reputation in the industry and cause demand for our services to decline.\nOur proprietary service is utilized in patient intake and engagement and to help healthcare services organizations better understand patients through medical histories, insurance benefits and socio-economic indicators. If our service fails to provide accurate and timely information, or if our content or any other element of our service is associated with errors or malfunctions, we could have liability to healthcare services clients or patients. We attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages and to require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules, protocols and data. Despite these precautions, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable, may not be binding upon patients or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages.\nOur proprietary software may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released. It is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or methodologies that our clients may deploy or rely upon. From time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software, and such defects or errors can be expected to appear in the future. Defects and errors that are not timely detected and remedied could expose us to risk of liability to healthcare services clients and patients and cause delays in introduction of new services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications or decrease market acceptance or client satisfaction with our services. If any of these risks occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be liable for use of incorrect or incomplete data we provide which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe store and display data for use by healthcare services clients in handling patient intake and engagement, including patient health information. Our clients, their patients, or third parties provide us with most of this data. If this data is incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of this data, adverse consequences may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us. In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to liability arising out of our intake, storage and display of information or erroneous health information. While we maintain\ninsurance coverage, we cannot be certain that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks relating to regulation\nWe are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations governing our collection, use, disclosure, or storage of personally identifiable information, including protected health information and payment card data, which may impose restrictions on us and our operations and subject us to penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nNumerous complex federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information, including protected health information. State laws may be even more restrictive and not preempted by HIPAA, and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies. These laws and regulations, including their interpretation by governmental agencies, are subject to frequent change and could have a negative impact on our business. Further, these varying interpretations could create complex compliance issues for us and our partners and potentially expose us to additional expense, liability, penalties, negatively impact our client relationships, and lead to adverse publicity, and all of these risks could adversely affect our business in the short and long term. In addition, contractual obligations and in the future, legislation may limit, forbid or regulate the use or transmission of health information outside of the United States or across other national borders. These developments, if adopted, could render our use of Canadian employees and other non-U.S. resources for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive.\nWe are a \u201cBusiness Associate\u201d as defined under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\"HITECH Act\") and their implementing regulations, collectively referred to as HIPAA. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (\"HHS\"), Office of Civil Rights, may impose civil penalties on a Business Associate for a failure to comply with any HIPAA requirement. The U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions under HIPAA. A Business Associate can also face criminal penalties for HIPAA violations. Penalties can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, such as whether the Business Associate\u2019s failure to comply was due to willful neglect. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for recklessness in misusing individuals\u2019 health information.\nThe security measures that we and our third-party vendors and subcontractors have in place to ensure compliance with privacy and data protection laws may not protect our facilities and systems from security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, malfeasance, programming and human errors or other similar events. Under the HITECH Act, as a Business Associate we may also be liable for privacy and security breaches and failures of our subcontractors. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our agreements with our subcontractors, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. A breach of privacy or security of individually identifiable health information by a subcontractor may result in an enforcement action, including criminal and civil liability, against us. We are not able to predict the extent of the impact such incidents may have on our business. Our failure to comply may result in criminal and civil liability because the potential for enforcement action against Business Associates is now greater. Enforcement actions against us could be costly and could interrupt regular operations, which may adversely affect our business. While we have not received any notices of violation of the applicable privacy and data protection laws and believe we are in compliance with such laws, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such notices in the future.\nOther federal and state laws restrict the use and protect the privacy and security of personally identifiable information are, in many cases, are not preempted by HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies. These varying interpretations can create complex compliance issues for us and our partners and potentially expose us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nFederal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the United States Federal Trade Commission and states\u2019 attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or\npersonally identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.\nThere is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data privacy and security issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data privacy and security laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identification, anonymization or pseudonymization of health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed and amended laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, such as the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and has been amended several times. Further, a new California privacy law, the CPRA was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023. Colorado and Virginia have enacted similar laws that will also become effective in 2023 and other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation. While state laws discussed herein contain an exception for certain health information, we cannot yet determine the full impact these laws or other such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, standards and obligations proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. Most countries around the world have enacted comprehensive privacy and data protection laws that can impact our business. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in the European Union, or EU. The GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and requires businesses subject to it to give more detailed disclosures about how they collect, use, and share personal information; contractually commit to data protection measures in contracts; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain data breaches; obtain consent to collect sensitive personal information such as health information; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals\u2019 data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct, and delete their personal information. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA, including the United States. A recent judicial decision from the EU and recent announcements from European regulators regarding transfers of personal information outside of the EEA have increased the legal risks and liabilities, and compliance and operational costs, of lawfully making such transfers. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, restrictions, or prohibitions on data processing, and fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of worldwide annual revenue.\nIn addition, further to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at\nthe end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK\u2019s European\nUnion (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to\ncertain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data\nProtection Act 2018 set out the UK\u2019s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the\nEU\u2019s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to\n\u00a317.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third\ncountry under the EU\u2019s GDPR, the European Commission, or EC, has now issued a decision recognizing\nthe UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data\noriginating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data\ntransfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK\ngovernment has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.\nTo enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, adequate safeguards must be\nimplemented in compliance with European and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued\nnew forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA\n(or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not\nsubject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that\nwere adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC\u2019s new\nstandard contractual clauses but has published a draft version of a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which, once finalized, will enable transfers from the UK. We will be required to implement these new safeguards\nwhen conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant\neffort and cost.\nUpon the closing of our acquisition of Insignia in December 2021, we became subject to additional laws and regulations, including those in the EEA, such as the GDPR. Compliance with such laws and regulations will require resources and could be more costly and take more time than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have operations in Canada and in Canada, our collection, use, disclosure, and management of personal\ninformation must comply with both federal and provincial privacy laws, which impose separate\nrequirements, but may overlap in some instances. The Personal Information Protection and Electronic\nDocuments Act, or PIPEDA, applies in all Canadian provinces except Alberta, British Columbia and Qu\u00e9bec, as well as to the transfer of consumer data across provincial borders. PIPEDA imposes stringent consumer\ndata protection obligations, requires privacy breach reporting, and limits the purposes for which\norganizations may collect, use, and disclose consumer data. The provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu\u00e9bec have enacted separate data privacy laws that are substantially similar to PIPEDA, but all three\nadditionally apply to our handling of our own employees\u2019 personal data within their respective provinces. Notably, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector, or the Private\nSector Act, was recently amended by Bill 64, an Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the\nprotection of personal information, which introduced major amendments to the Private Sector Act, notably, to impose significant and stringent new obligations on Qu\u00e9bec businesses while increasing the powers of\nQuebec\u2019s supervisory authority. We may incur additional costs and expenses related to compliance with\nthese laws and may incur significant liability if we are not able to comply with these laws. We are also\nsubject to Canada\u2019s anti-spam legislation, or CASL, which includes rules governing commercial electronic\nmessages, which include marketing emails, text messages, and social media advertisements. Under these\nrules, we must follow certain standards when sending marketing communications, are prohibited from\nsending them to customers without their consent, and can be held liable for violations.\nInternationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. Cross-border data transfers and other future developments regarding local data residency could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services in some markets and may lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties or adverse publicity, which could adversely affect our business and financial position could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from offering certain services in specific jurisdictions.\nFuture laws, regulations, standards, obligations amendments, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and obligations could impair our or our clients\u2019 ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our Platform, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our client base and increase our revenue. New laws, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations could impair our or our customers\u2019 ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to patients or consumers, which could decrease demand for our platform offerings, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our client base and increase our revenue. Accordingly, we may find it necessary or desirable to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our software or Platform and otherwise adapt to these changes.\nWe are also subject to self-regulatory standards and industry certifications that may legally or contractually apply to us. These include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\"PCI-DSS\") and Security Organization Control 2 (\"SOC 2\"), with which we are currently compliant, and HITRUST certification, which we currently maintain. In the event we fail to comply with the PCI-DSS or fail to maintain our SOC 2 or HITRUST certification, we could be in breach of our obligations under customer and other contracts, fines and other penalties could result, and we may suffer reputational harm and damage to our business. Further, our clients may expect us to comply with more stringent privacy and data security requirements than those imposed by laws, regulations or self-regulatory requirements, and we may be obligated contractually to comply with additional or different standards relating to our handling or protection of data.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with domestic or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected privacy or security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our clients to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to develop new products and features could be limited. Any of these developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Privacy and data security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit retention of our Platform by existing clients or adoption of our Platform by new clients.\nThe healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving.\nHealthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") was adopted, which is a healthcare reform measure that provides healthcare insurance for millions of Americans. The ACA includes a variety of healthcare reform provisions and requirements that became effective at varying times through 2018 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, which may significantly impact our industry and our business. Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.\nFurther, on March 9, 2020, the HHS, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (\"ONC\") and CMS promulgated final rules aimed at supporting seamless and secure access, exchange, and use of electronic health information (\"EHI\"), by increasing innovation and competition by giving patients and their healthcare service providers secure access to health information and new tools, allowing for more choice in care and treatment. The final rules are intended to clarify and operationalize provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act (\"Cures Act\"), regarding interoperability and \u201cinformation blocking,\u201d and create significant new requirements for health care industry participants. Information blocking is defined as activity that is likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of EHI, where a health information technology developer, health information network or health information exchange knows or should know that such practice is likely to interfere with access to, exchange or use of EHI. The new rules create significant new requirements for health care industry participants and require certain electronic health record technology to incorporate standardized application programming interfaces (\"APIs\") to allow individuals to securely and easily access structured EHI using smartphone applications. The ONC will also implement provisions of the Cures Act requiring that patients can electronically access all of their EHI (structured and/or unstructured) at no cost. Finally, to further support access and exchange of EHI, the final ONC rule implements the information blocking provisions of the Cures Act and identified eight \u201creasonable and necessary activities\u201d as exceptions to information blocking activities, as long as specific conditions are met. In light of the COVID-19 public health emergency, on October 29, 2020, HHS released an interim final rule delaying compliance dates for certain aspects of the final rule in light of pressures placed on the healthcare industry by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the impact of these rules and any delays that may take place. As currently drafted, certified API Developers had to comply with new administrative requirements by April 5, 2021 and must provide all certified API technology by December 31, 2022.\nThe final CMS rule focuses on patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") fee-for-service programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and qualified health plans on the federally-facilitated exchanges, and enacts measures to enable patients to have both their clinical and administrative information travel with them. By January 1, 2021, payors had to make patient data dating back to January 1, 2016 available through an APO. Recognizing the challenges faced by payers during the COVID-19 public health emergency, CMS exercised enforcement discretion for the Patient Access API and Provider Directory API policies for MA, Medicaid, CHIP and QHP issuers on the FFEs* effective January 1, 2021 through July 1, 2021. CMS began enforcing these new requirements on July 1, 2021.\nRecent regulatory reform constitutes a significant departure from previous regulations regarding patient data. While these rules benefit us in that certain EHR vendors will no longer be permitted to interfere with our attempts at integration, they may also make it easier for other similar companies to enter the market, creating increased competition and reducing our market share. It is unclear at this time what the costs of compliance with the final rules will be, and what additional risks there may be to our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to various other laws and regulations, including, among others, anti-kickback laws, antitrust laws and the privacy and data protection laws described below.\nIf we or our clients fail to comply with federal and state laws governing submission of false or fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs and financial relationships among healthcare services organizations, we or our clients may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government healthcare programs.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and relationships, and those of our clients, are regulated by a number of federal, state and local governmental entities. The impact of these regulations can adversely affect us even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations. We must ensure that our products and services comply with applicable laws and regulations and can be used by our clients in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations. The noncompliance use of our products and services could negatively affect the marketability of our products and services or our compliance with our client contracts, or even expose us to direct or indirect liability under the theory that we had assisted our clients in a violation of healthcare laws or regulations.\nA number of federal and state laws, including anti-kickback restrictions and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims, apply to healthcare services organizations and others that make, offer, seek or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state healthcare program and, in some instances, any private program. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly, in cash or in kind, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service covered by these programs.\nIn addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations, also impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payers) or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.\nAdditionally, many states also have state anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program. Moreover, both federal and state laws forbid bribery and similar behavior. These laws are complex and their application to our specific services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, could require us to refund portions of our services fees, could cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers and could have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.\nMoreover, there are federal and state laws that forbid the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), in exchange for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients or billing based on referrals between individuals and/or entities that have various financial, ownership or other business relationships. In many cases, billing for care arising from such actions is illegal. These limitations can vary widely from state to state and, application of these state laws, the federal anti-inducement law and the Stark Law is very complex. Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper. This could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, could require us to refund portions of our services fees and could have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.\nFederal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have recently increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other healthcare reimbursement laws and rules. From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry receive inquiries or subpoenas to produce documents in connection with government investigations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are\nnot successful in our defense, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration may in the future determine that our technology solutions are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and we may face additional costs and risks as a result.\nThe FDA may promulgate a policy or regulation that affects our products and services. FDA regulations govern among other things, product development, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution and import and export. Non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, a recommendation by the FDA to disallow us from entering into government contracts and criminal prosecutions. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replace or refund of the cost of any device.\nIndividuals may claim our text messaging services are not compliant with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") is a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls, faxes and text messages. We must ensure that our services that leverage text messaging for marketing purposes comply with TCPA regulations and agency guidance. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") as the agency that implements and enforces the TCPA, may disagree with our interpretation of the TCPA and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate the TCPA could subject us to civil penalties, could invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, could require us to refund portions of our services fees, and could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, we could be subject to class action lawsuits for any claimed TCPA violations. Even an unsuccessful challenge by consumers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.\nOur employees in Canada are subject to the laws and regulations of the government of Canada and its subdivisions.\nCertain of our employees are based in Canada and are subject to additional laws and regulations by the government of Canada, as well as its provinces. These include Canadian federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws and qualification for tax status. If we fail to comply with Canadian laws and regulations, or if the government of Canada or its provinces determines that our corporate actions do not comply with applicable Canadian law, we could face sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDue to the particular nature of certain services we provide or the manner in which we provide them, we may be subject to additional government regulation and foreign government regulation.\nWhile our Platform is primarily subject to government regulations pertaining to healthcare, certain aspects of our Platform may require us to comply with regulatory schema from other areas. Examples of such regulatory schema include:\n\u2022Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and foreign anti-bribery laws. The FCPA makes it illegal for U.S. persons, including U.S. companies, and their subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and agents, to promise, authorize or make any corrupt payment, or otherwise provide anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, any foreign political party or party official, or candidate for foreign political office to obtain or retain business. Violations of the FCPA can also result in violations of other U.S. laws, including anti-money laundering, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy laws. There are severe penalties for violating the FCPA. In addition, the Company may also be subject to other non-U.S. anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. If our employees, contractors, vendors, or partners fail to comply with the FCPA and/or foreign anti-bribery laws, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions, and our ability to develop new prospects and retain existing customers could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Economic sanctions and export controls. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, and dealings with specified countries and territories, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, and other sanctioned persons, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As federal, state and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions in these areas increase, we expect our costs to comply with these requirements will increase as well. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could result in the limitation, suspension or termination of our services, imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, and/or the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets. Further, our Platform incorporates encryption technology. This encryption technology may be exported from the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. Such solutions may also be subject to certain regulatory reporting requirements. Various countries also regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers\u2019 ability to import our Platform into those countries. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and of exports and imports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required approval for our Platform, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the provision of our Platform, including with respect to new applications, may delay the introduction of our Platform in various markets or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our Platform to some countries altogether.\nRisks relating to our dependence on third parties\nWe rely on our third-party vendors and partners to execute our business strategy. Replacing them could be difficult and disruptive to our business. If we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining such relationships on terms favorable to us, our business may not succeed.\nWe have entered into contracts with third-party vendors to provide critical services relating to our business, including initial software development and cloud hosting. We also rely on third-party providers to enable automated eligibility and benefits verification through our Platform, and we outsource certain of our software development and design, quality assurance and operations activities to third-party contractors that have employees and consultants in international locations that may be subject to political and economic instability, including India, Russia and Ukraine. Our dependence on such third-party contractors creates numerous risks, in particular, the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management with respect to these operations.\nIn addition, the continued military incursion of Russia into Ukraine could impact macroeconomic conditions, give rise to regional instability, increase the threat of cyberwarfare and result in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S. and the international community in a manner that adversely affects us and our third-party contractors that have employees and consultants located in Russia and Ukraine. Further, although the route, length and impact of any military action are highly unpredictable, individuals located in these areas have been and could continue to be forced to evacuate or voluntarily choose to relocate, making them unavailable to provide services, such as software engineering, to support our business. It could also disrupt or delay our communications with such resources or the flow of funds to support their operations, or otherwise render some of our resources unavailable. Further, although the route, length and impact of any military action are highly unpredictable, individuals located in these areas could be forced to evacuate or voluntarily choose to relocate, making them unavailable to provide services, such as software engineering, to support our business. This may cause significant disruption, including delays in releases of new versions or updates of our software, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will continue to depend on these and other third-party relationships in order to grow our business for the foreseeable future. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining existing and, if needed, establishing new relationships with third parties, our ability to efficiently operate existing services or develop new services could be impaired, and, as a result, our competitive position or our results of operations could suffer.\nWe also depend on our third-party processing partners to perform payment processing services, which generate almost all of our payments revenue. Our processing partners may go out of business or otherwise be unable or unwilling to continue providing such services, which could significantly and materially reduce our payments revenue and disrupt our business. A number of our processing contracts require us to assume liability for any losses our processing partners may suffer as a result of losses caused by our healthcare services clients and their patients, including losses caused by chargebacks and fraud. Thus, in the event of a significant loss by our processing partners, we may be required to pay-out a large amount of cash in one or two business days following such event and, if we do not have sufficient cash on hand, may be deemed in breach of such contracts. A contractual dispute with our processing partners could adversely impact our revenue. Certain contracts may expire or be terminated,\nand we may not be able to enter into a new payment processor relationship that replicates the associated revenue for a considerable period of time.\nIn the event that these service providers fail to maintain adequate levels of support, do not provide high quality service, increase the fees they charge us, discontinue their lines of business, terminate our contractual arrangements or cease or reduce operations, we may suffer additional costs and be required to pursue new third-party relationships, which could materially disrupt our operations and our ability to provide our products and services, and could divert management\u2019s time and resources. It would be difficult to replace some of our third-party vendors in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future, and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If these services fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation and operating results could be harmed.\nIn addition, we have entered into contracts with providers of EHR and PM solutions, and we intend to pursue such agreements in the future. These contracts are typically structured as commercial and technical agreements, pursuant to which we integrate certain of our Platform solutions into the EHR and PM systems that are utilized by many of our clients, for agreed payments or provision of services to such providers of EHR and PM solutions. Our ability to form and maintain these agreements in order to facilitate the integration of our Platform into the EHR and PM systems used by our healthcare services clients and their patients is important to the success of our business. If providers of EHR or PM solutions amend, terminate or fail to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, we may need to seek other ways of integrating our Platform with the EHR and PM systems of our healthcare services clients, which could be costly and time consuming, and could adversely affect our business results.\nWe or the providers of EHR and PM solutions with which we contract may terminate or seek to amend our agreements in order to incorporate new final rules promulgated on March 9, 2020 by the HHS, ONC, and CMS, which are further described above and are aimed at supporting seamless and secure access, exchange, and use of EHI by increasing innovation and competition by giving patients and their healthcare service providers secure access to health information and new tools, allowing for more choice in care and treatment.\nWe may also seek to enter into new agreements in the future, and we may not be successful in entering into future agreements on terms favorable to us. Any delay in entering agreements with providers of EHR or PM solutions or other technology providers could either delay the development and adoption of our products and services and reduce their competitiveness. Any such delay could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers to support our products, and a loss or degradation in performance of these suppliers and contract manufacturers could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers for the materials and components used to operate our Phreesia Platform and product offerings, and to manufacture and assemble our hardware, including the PhreesiaPad and our on-site kiosks, which we refer to as Arrivals Kiosks. We rely on a sole supplier, for example, as the manufacturer of our PhreesiaPads and Arrivals Kiosks, which help drive our business and support our subscription, payment processing and life sciences offerings. In connection with these services, our supplier builds new hardware for us and refurbishes and maintains existing hardware.\nAny of our other suppliers or third-party contract manufacturers may be unwilling or unable to supply the necessary materials and components or manufacture and assemble our products reliably and at the levels we anticipate or that are required by the market. Our ability to supply our products commercially and to develop any future products depends, in part, on our ability to obtain these materials, components and products in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization. If we are required to change contract manufacturers due to any change in or termination of our relationships with these third parties, or if our manufacturers are unable to obtain the materials they need to produce our products at consistent prices or at all, (including, without limitation, because of the effect of tariffs or other trade restrictions), we may lose sales, experience manufacturing or other delays, incur increased costs or otherwise experience impairment to our client relationships. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish alternative relationships on similar terms, without delay or at all.\nIf our third-party suppliers fail to deliver the required quantities of materials on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality on a timely basis, the supply of our products to clients and the development of any future products will be delayed, limited or prevented, which could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our clients, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with clients, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nOur ability to deliver our products and services, particularly our cloud-based solutions, is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network connection with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone and facsimile services. Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments.\nHowever, we have experienced limited interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slow down the performance of our services, and we may experience more significant interruptions in the future. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party suppliers, including bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other catastrophic events, could affect the security or availability of our services and prevent or inhibit the ability of our partners to access our services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could result in substantial costs to remedy those problems or negatively impact our relationship with our clients, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny disruption in the network access, telecommunications or co-location services provided by third-party providers or any failure of or by third-party providers\u2019 systems or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We exercise limited control over our third-party suppliers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. We have experienced failures by third-party providers\u2019 systems which resulted in a limited interruption of our system, although this failure did not result in any claims against us. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with clients and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third-party liabilities.\nThe reliability and performance of our Internet connection may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.\nRisks relating to taxes and accounting standards\nChanges in tax regulations and accounting standards, or changes in related judgments or assumptions could materially impact our financial position and results of operation.\nWe are subject to federal and state income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, and such laws and rates vary by jurisdiction. We are now registered in all states that assess sales taxes on our services. Although we believe our tax practices and provisions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation, changes in the taxation of our activities and proposed changes in tax laws could cause the ultimate settlement of our tax liabilities to be materially different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, there could be a material effect on our tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made, which could materially impact our financial results. Further, any changes in the taxation of our activities, including certain proposed changes in U.S. tax laws, may increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period. Therefore, we may be subject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time.\nFurthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations or in our accounting assumptions and/or judgments could significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to delay the filing of our consolidated financial statements, or to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period consolidated financial statements. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $332.5 million due to prior period losses, which, subject to the following discussion, are generally available to be carried forward to offset a portion of our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. In general, under Section 382 (\"Section 382\") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset future taxable income. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have completed a Section 382 study and as a result of the analysis, it is more likely than not that we have experienced an \"ownership change.\" In addition, it is more likely than not that our existing NOLs are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as amended by The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act of 2020, the amount of post 2017 NOLs that we are permitted to utilize in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs. We have a valuation allowance related to our NOLs to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized.\nRisks relating to our indebtedness\nIn order to support the growth of our business, we may need to incur additional indebtedness under our current credit facilities or seek capital through new equity or debt financings, which sources of additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and we intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth, respond to business challenges or opportunities, develop new applications and services, enhance our existing solution and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and potentially acquire complementary businesses and technologies. For the year ended January 31, 2022 our net cash used in operating activities was $74.7 million. As of January 31, 2022, we had $313.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, which are held for working capital purposes. As of January 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit, with the ability to borrow up to $50.0 million under the revolving line of credit included in the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Second SVB Facility\") with Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\"). On March 28, 2022, we entered into the First Loan Modification Agreement to the Second SVB Facility (as amended, the \"Third SVB Facility\") pursuant to which we have the ability to borrow up to $100.0 million. Borrowings under the facility are secured by substantially all of our properties, rights and assets, excluding intellectual property.\nOur future capital requirements may be significantly different from our current estimates and will depend on many factors, including the need to:\n\u2022finance unanticipated working capital requirements;\n\u2022develop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\u2022fund strategic relationships, including joint ventures and co-investments;\n\u2022fund additional implementation engagements;\n\u2022respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022acquire complementary businesses, technologies, products or services.\nAccordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings or collaborative arrangements to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, during times of economic instability, it has been difficult for many companies to obtain financing in the public markets or to obtain debt financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe credit agreement governing the Third SVB Facility contains certain customary restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, create subsidiaries, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and transfer or dispose of assets as well as financial covenants requiring us to maintain a specified level of recurring revenue growth, a specified maximum funded debt to recurring revenue ratio and a specified amount of minimum liquidity.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. These covenants could also limit our ability to seek capital through the incurrence of new indebtedness or, if we are unable to meet our obligations, require us to repay any outstanding amounts with sources of capital we may otherwise use to fund our business, operations and strategy.\nRisks relating to ownership of our common stock\nOur share price has been and may in the future be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022market conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in our industry in particular;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, our company, our customers, suppliers or employees;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial reports and results of operations;\n\u2022changes in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022our ability to satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements;\n\u2022indebtedness incurred in the future;\n\u2022introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022regulatory developments;\n\u2022litigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022economic and political conditions or events; and\n\u2022our sale of common stock or other securities in the future.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nThe trading market for our common stock is also influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more securities or industry analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or provides more favorable recommendations about our competitors, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. We may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to comply with these requirements.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, together with rules implemented by the SEC and applicable market regulators. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have limited experience complying with Section 404, and such compliance may require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline if investors and others lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other applicable regulatory authorities and our business could be harmed.\nRisks relating to our bylaws and certificate of incorporation\nAnti-takeover provisions under our incorporation documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (\"certificate of incorporation\") and our second amended and restated bylaws (\"bylaws\") contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include:\n\u2022a board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office;\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022a requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than 75% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022a requirement of approval of not less than 75% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (\"DGCL\"), which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors or cause us to take other corporate actions. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur bylaws designate certain specified courts as the sole and exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \"Chancery Court\") will be the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the \"Delaware Forum Provision\"). The Delaware Forum Provision does not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \"Exchange Act\"). Our bylaws further provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the \"Federal Forum Provision\"). Our bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing the claims identified above, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware or the State of New York. Additionally, the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. If the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such an action. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Chancery Court or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 18808, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PHR"}
