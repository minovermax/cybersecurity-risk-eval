Risk Factors\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe below summary risks provide an overview of many of the risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. As a result, the below summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary risks together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Additional risks, beyond those summarized below or discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate. Consistent with the foregoing, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u2022The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Electronic Arts Inc. could have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022The completion of the merger may be delayed or prevented. The failure to complete the merger with Electronic Arts could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to develop and timely publish new high-quality, engaging games and continue to enhance our existing games, particularly our most successful games, our revenue would suffer;\n\u2022Successfully developing and monetizing free-to-play games is a challenging business model;\n\u2022The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and our players may prefer our competitors\u2019 products or competing forms of entertainment;\n\u2022We rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue that we derive from in-app purchases;\n\u2022We have depended on a small number of growth games for a significant portion of our revenue in recent fiscal periods. If these games do not continue to grow or we do not release highly successful new games, our revenue would decline;\n\u2022We derive the majority of our revenue from Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with each of Apple and Google or if either of these storefronts were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer;\n\u2022The operators of Digital Storefronts on which we publish our free-to-play games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others\u2019 contracts with them;\n\u2022The manufacturers of mobile devices on which our free-to-play games can be played have the unilateral ability to change the hardware or software of their devices which may negatively affect our business;\n\u2022We derive a significant portion of our revenue from advertisements and offers that are incorporated into our free-to-play games through relationships with third parties. If we lose the ability to provide these advertisements and offers for any reason, if we become victim to advertising fraud or if any events occur that negatively impact the revenue we receive from these sources, it would negatively impact our operating results;\n\u2022It is becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive for us to acquire players for our games and we may not achieve a positive return on investment on our user acquisition efforts;\n\u2022We have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future and may not achieve and sustain profitability or growth in future periods;\n\u2022Our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict, which in turn could cause volatility in our stock price;\n\u2022Our business will suffer if our acquisition and strategic investment activities are unsuccessful or disrupt our ongoing business, which may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions;\n\u2022We may not, or may be unable to, renew our existing content licenses when they expire and may not choose to obtain additional licenses or be able to obtain new licenses on favorable terms, which could negatively impact our revenue if we fail to replace such revenue with revenue from games based on our own intellectual property;\n\u2022Securing license agreements to develop, publish and market games based on or significantly incorporating celebrities, third-party licensed brands, properties, and other content typically requires that we make minimum guaranteed royalty and other payments to such licensors, and to the extent such payments become impaired, our operating results would be harmed;\n\u2022If we do not successfully establish and maintain awareness of our brand and games, if we fail to develop high-quality, engaging games that are differentiated from our prior games, if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining our brand or our games or if our games contain defects or objectionable content, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed;\n\u2022We rely on a combination of our own servers and technology and third party infrastructure to operate our games. If we experience any system or network failures, unexpected technical problems, cyber-attacks or any other interruption to our games, it could reduce our sales, increase costs, or result in a loss of revenue or loss of end users of our games;\n\u2022Cyber-attacks, security breaches, and computer viruses could harm our business, reputation, brand and operating results;\n\u2022We use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games. If we experience any prolonged technical issues with this engine or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause our financial results to fall below expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline;\n\u2022We rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business;\n\u2022Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel;\n\u2022Any restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect, and these actions may adversely affect our business;\n\u2022We may not realize the benefits expected through our strategic relationship with Tencent and other aspects of the relationship could have adverse effects on our business;\n\u2022Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves;\n\u2022If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected;\n\u2022Conversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our ERP system, and problems with the design, implementation or operation of these systems and processes could interfere with, and therefore harm, our business and operations;\n\u2022Changes in foreign exchange rates and limitations on the convertibility of foreign currencies could adversely affect our business and operating results;\n\u2022We face added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks as a result of our international operations and distribution, any of which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results;\n\u2022If the mobile games market is disrupted by new technologies and we are not able to appropriately adapt our business, our business will suffer;\n\u2022If we fail to deliver our games at the same time as new mobile devices are commercially introduced, our revenue may suffer;\n\u2022If the mobile gaming market does not continue to grow, our business could be adversely affected; and\n\u2022Changes to digital platforms\u2019 rules relating to \u201cloot boxes,\u201d or the potential adoption of regulations or legislation impacting loot boxes, could require us to make changes to some of our games\u2019 economies or design, which could negatively impact the monetization of these games reducing our revenue.\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Electronic Arts Inc. could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn February 8, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Electronic Arts, pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts will, upon the terms and subject to regulatory and stockholder approval and the other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, merge with and into us, and we will be the surviving corporation of the Merger and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $12.50 in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes.\nUncertainty about the possible effect of the pendency of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement may have an adverse effect on our business and operations that may be material to our company. Factors that may affect our business include the effect of the announcement of the Merger on our ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with players, partners and others with whom we do business, the occurrence of any circumstance or any other events that could give rise to the termination of the transactions, or the failure to obtain the approval of our stockholders or failure to satisfy any other conditions precedent to consummate the transactions, including the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all . Electronic Arts\u2019 ability to successfully integrate our operations and employees, risks that the Merger disrupts current ongoing business operations, including diversion from day-to-day\noperations and risks of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the Merger (including stockholder litigation relating to the transactions).\nOur players may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to possible changes to our games, services, or policies. Similarly, our key business partners may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. Uncertainty may cause players to refrain from playing or spending money in our games or downloading our games, and partners may seek to change existing business relationships, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition in a way that may be material to our company.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, until the Merger becomes effective or the Merger Agreement is terminated. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may otherwise harm our business and operations.\nThe completion of the Merger may be delayed or prevented. The failure to complete the Merger with Electronic Arts could adversely affect our business.\nCompletion of the Merger with Electronic Arts is subject to conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay, or otherwise adversely affect its completion in a material way, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under antitrust and competition laws, and similar competition approvals or consents that must be obtained from regulatory entities in the United States and Austria, as well as the approval of our stockholders and potential future stockholder litigation. If the Merger or a similar transaction is not completed, the share price of our common stock may drop to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that a transaction will be completed. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that we will be required to pay Electronic Arts a termination fee of $78.9 million in certain circumstances, including if our board of directors changes or withdraws its recommendation of the Merger to our stockholders, or if we terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Further, a failure to complete the Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Any disruption to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger and from intensifying competition from our competitors, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our players and key business partners, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failure to complete the Merger. There can be no assurance that our business, these relationships, or our financial condition will not be adversely affected, as compared to the condition prior to the announcement of the Merger, if the Merger is not consummated.\nIf we fail to develop and timely publish new high-quality, engaging games and continue to enhance our existing games, particularly our most successful games, our revenue would suffer.\nOur business depends on developing and publishing mobile games that consumers will download and spend time and money playing. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, technology, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and continue to update our successful games, and we often must make decisions about these matters well in advance of a product\u2019s release to timely implement them. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences and the number of applications they are willing to download to and maintain on their devices, competing gaming and non-gaming related applications, new mobile platforms and the availability of other entertainment activities. If our games do not meet consumer expectations, or they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. It can be difficult for us to predict with certainty when we will launch a new game as games may require longer development schedules or beta testing periods to meet our quality standards and our players\u2019 expectations. For example, in 2018, we decided to delay the worldwide launch dates of WWE Universe and Diner DASH Adventures to May and June 2019, respectively, in order to give the development teams additional time to work on these titles. In August 2019 and August 2020, respectively, we announced that we were delaying the expected worldwide launch dates of Disney Sorcerer\u2019s Arena and Deer Hunter World for similar reasons. While Diner DASH Adventures and Disney Sorcerer\u2019s Arena have been commercially successful, WWE Universe has performed significantly below our expectations and we announced in January 2021 that we will sunset the game in March 2021. Furthermore, our future\ngame launches could also be delayed, they may not be successful when launched, or we may decide to not globally launch a game at all if its performance during beta testing does not meet our quality standards (as was the case with our Originals title that we sunset during the third quarter of 2020), any of which would likely harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEven if our games are successfully introduced in a timely fashion and initially adopted, a failure to continually update them with compelling content or a subsequent shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers could cause a decline in our games\u2019 popularity that could materially reduce our revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition, which effect would be magnified for our most successful games and, in particular, Design Home. In connection with our product strategy, we have committed significant resources to updating, adding new features to and enhancing our existing titles as opposed to launching as many new titles as we have in prior years. However, we may not be successful in doing so, such as was the case with our update of Covet Fashion in the first quarter of 2017. It is difficult to predict when and how quickly the popularity and revenue of one of our games will decline, and if any of our key growth games experience any such unexpected declines, we may not meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a given quarter. Furthermore, we compete for the discretionary spending of consumers, who face a vast array of entertainment choices, including social media and other non-gaming related apps, games played on personal computers and consoles, television, movies, sports and the Internet. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games compared to other forms of entertainment, our business and financial results would be seriously harmed.\nIn addition to the market factors noted above, our ability to successfully develop and launch games for mobile devices and their ability to achieve and maintain commercial success will depend on our ability to:\n\u25cf minimize launch delays and cost overruns on the development of new games and features;\n\u25cf successfully enhance and increase the revenue we generate from our existing growth games;\n\u25cf effectively market and monetize our games;\n\u25cf achieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and user acquisition efforts;\n\u25cf sustain sufficient interest in our games compared to other forms of entertainment for our players;\n\u25cf adapt to new technologies and feature sets for mobile and other devices;\n\u25cf attract and retain experienced and talented employees;\n\u25cf compete successfully against a large and growing number of existing market participants;\n\u25cf minimize and quickly resolve bugs and outages; and\n\u25cf acquire and successfully integrate high quality mobile game assets, personnel or companies.\nWe have implemented a work from home policy for all of our workforce as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which may have a substantial impact on employee morale and productivity, disrupt access to facilities, equipment, networks, corporate systems, books and records and may add additional expenses and strain on our business. The duration and extent of the impact from the coronavirus outbreak on our business depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the availability and effectiveness of a vaccine, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees. While we were able to successfully launch MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2020 and Disney Sorcerer\u2019s Arena in March 2020 while our workforce was working from home and have been publishing updates and running live operations for our games, we believe that if our employees are required to continue to work exclusively or primarily from home during most or all of 2021 and beyond, it could ultimately negatively impact game development and potentially result in delays in launching new games or releasing significant product updates.\nThese and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in continuing to develop, launch and enhance successful mobile games in accordance with our operating plan. If we do not succeed in doing so, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation will suffer.\nSuccessfully developing and monetizing free-to-play games is a challenging business model.\nWe face significant challenges in achieving our goal of becoming the leading developer and publisher of free-to-play mobile games. Successful free-to-play games tend to include competitive gameplay, deep meta game features, player versus player activities, regularly updated content and other complex technological and creative attributes. While we are working to include such features in our games, we may not successfully update our games to include these features or they may not be well received by our players. For example, the significant update to Racing Rivals that we released in the fourth quarter of 2016 was poorly received by players, led to a significant decline in revenue and ultimately contributed to our decision to sunset this title in April 2019. If we are unable to successfully implement our product strategy, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected. Additionally, our existing games compete with our new offerings and the offerings of our competitors, and revenue from our existing catalog games has declined over time, a trend that we expect to continue.\nOur efforts to develop new growth games and enhance our existing growth games may prove unsuccessful or, even if successful, it may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenue because, among other reasons:\n\u25cf our strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because they are free and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games; however, players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25cf the increasing competition throughout the mobile gaming industry for downloads, not only with other mobile games but also with social media and other non-gaming related applications;\n\u25cf limits on the number of mobile applications players are willing to download to and maintain on their devices;\n\u25cf poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity;\n\u25cf ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts, particularly in light of Apple\u2019s decision to deprecate identifiers for advertisers (\u201cIDFAs\u201d) which we expect to occur early in the Spring of 2021;\n\u25cf lack of sufficient social and community features;\n\u25cf lack of prominent storefront featuring;\n\u25cf failure to reach and maintain Top Free App Store rankings; and\n\u25cf the relatively large file size of some of our games; in particular, our games often utilize a significant amount of the available memory on a user\u2019s device and tend to consume additional space as players advance through our games, which may cause players to delete our games once the file size grows beyond the capacity of their devices\u2019 storage limitations;\n\u25cf even if our games are widely downloaded, we may fail to retain users or optimize the monetization of these games; this may occur for a variety of reasons, including poor game design or quality, lack of social and community features, gameplay issues such as game unavailability, long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues, lack of differentiation from predecessor games or other competitive games, lack of innovative features that surprise and delight our players, differences in user demographics and purchasing power or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates;\n\u25cf future games that we release may fail to resonate with consumers and games that incorporate licensed property may not be financially successful due to the minimum guaranteed royalty payments to our licensors;\n\u25cf we intend to continue to develop games based upon our own intellectual property, in addition to well-known licensed brands and properties, and we may encounter difficulties in generating sufficient consumer interest in and downloads of our games;\n\u25cf many well-funded public and private companies have released, or plan to release, games in the same genres as our growth games or games incorporating the same licensed brands that we use in our games (e.g., Disney/Pixar), and this competition will make it more difficult for us to differentiate our games and derive significant revenue from them;\n\u25cf we may have difficulty hiring the experienced monetization, live operations, server technology, software and data engineer, game designer, data analyst, user experience, economist, and product management personnel that we require to develop our new games and support our existing growth and catalog games, particularly in the competitive hiring market in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located, or may face difficulties in developing our technology platform and incorporating it into our products or developing unique gameplay;\n\u25cf we depend on the proper and continued functioning of our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our connected games that are delivered as a service; and\n\u25cf the impact of potential regulatory issues, including:\n\u25cf various jurisdictions are assessing the legality of \u201cloot boxes\u201d which are commonly used in some of our top games. The Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) held a public workshop in August 2019 to examine, and released a staff paper in August 2020 summarizing, consumer protection issues related to loot boxes. If the FTC or a comparable regulatory or legislative body in another jurisdiction determines that loot boxes constitute gambling or otherwise elects to regulate the use of loot boxes, we may be required to stop utilizing loot boxes within our games that are distributed in such jurisdictions, which would negatively impact our revenue;\n\u25cf the FTC has previously indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors, and the FTC might issue rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases or name us as a defendant in a future regulatory action or lawsuit; and\n\u25cf various legislators, administrative bodies and courts, primarily in Europe, have taken actions (including imposing fines) or may be considering taking actions (including antitrust enforcement) against Apple and Google, which are our primary distribution platforms, and Facebook, which is our primary user acquisition channel.\nIf we do not achieve a sufficient return on our investment with respect to our free-to-play business model, it will negatively affect our operating results and may require us to formulate a new business strategy.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do and our players may prefer our competitors\u2019 products or competing forms of entertainment.\nDeveloping, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. For players, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews. We compete for space on user\u2019s smartphones and tablet devices in terms of the number of applications on their device and the amount of storage consumed by such applications. We also compete more generally for the time, attention and discretionary spending of users of smartphones\nand tablet devices who are spending ever-increasing amounts of time on social media, messaging and music, movie and television streaming applications, personal computer and console games, sports and the Internet. We compete for promotional and Digital Storefront placement based on our relationship with the Digital Storefront owner, historical performance, game quality, perception of sales potential, customer reviews and relationships with licensors of brands and other content. For content licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, historical financial performance of prior licensed content titles, perceptions of development quality, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.\nWe compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Activision (the parent company of King Digital Entertainment), Disney, Electronic Arts (\u201cEA Mobile\u201d), Gameloft, Netmarble (including its Kabam Games subsidiary), Rovio, Stillfront, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including AppLovin, Epic Games, Jam City, Miniclip, Niantic, Playrix, Pocket Gems, Scopely, and Supercell. In addition, hyper-casual games published by companies such as Crazy Labs, Lion Studios, and Voodoo account for a significant and growing percentage of mobile gaming downloads.\nWe also face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets. We could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Verizon, choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games. For example, in 2019 Apple launched its Apple Arcade subscription service in which users receive access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. In addition, we also face competition from mobile applications and websites focused on the home design market, which may include games, e-commerce titles, design applications and others seeking to displace our Design Home title which is a leading title in the currently unsaturated home design application market. Competitors in this space include Redecor - Home Design Makeover published by Reworks, and may include established game developers, established real estate companies, interior design companies, e-commerce companies and other well-funded private companies looking to enter the home design market. Given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. As an example of the competition that we face, it has been estimated that more than 4.5 million applications, including nearly 1 million active games, were available on Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store as of January 31, 2021. The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.\nWe also compete for downloads and time spent on mobile devices with companies that develop popular social media and messaging applications, such as Facebook (with its Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp and other applications), Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube, companies that develop streaming music, movie and television applications, such as Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, Disney+, HBO Go, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, and with companies that create other non-gaming related software applications, such as Kim Kardashian West\u2019s own personal media application.\nSome of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:\n\u25cfsignificantly greater financial resources;\n\u25cfthe ability or willingness to spend significantly more than we do to acquire new players, which may be due to competitors having games with higher lifetime values than our games (i.e., the amount of money the average paying player spends in the competitor\u2019s game over the player\u2019s lifetime is greater than in our games) or where a competitor is willing to pay to acquire users in a manner that does not have a positive return on investment in an effort to increase its revenue and/or user base;\n\u25cfgreater experience with free-to-play games, building and maintaining games, and building social and community features into mobile games, as well as more effective game monetization;\n\u25cfstronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;\n\u25cfthe capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;\n\u25cflarger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;\n\u25cflarger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;\n\u25cfmore substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;\n\u25cflower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;\n\u25cfgreater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise;\n\u25cfbroader global distribution and presence; and\n\u25cfgreater talent, both in overall headcount and in terms of experience in creating successful titles.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could lose market share, any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue that we derive from in-app purchases.\nWe rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue derived from in-app purchases (as opposed to advertisements and incentivized offers) and installation rates and user-growth have declined for us with our most recent product launches. The percentage of unique paying players for our largest revenue-generating free-to-play games has typically been less than 5%, when measured as the number of unique paying users on a given day divided by the number of unique users on that day, though this percentage fluctuates, and it may be higher than 5% for some of our games during specific, relatively short time periods, such as immediately following worldwide launch, during special events or following content updates or marketing campaigns. To significantly increase our revenue, we must increase the number of downloads of our games, increase the number of players who convert into paying players by making in-app purchases or enrolling in subscriptions, increase the amount that our paying players spend in our games and/or increase the length of time our players generally play our games. We might not succeed in our efforts to increase the monetization rates of our users, particularly if we do not increase the amount of social features in our games or otherwise improve our games though updates and live operations. In addition, if the current COVID-19 pandemic results in a prolonged economic downturn, our users may reduce their discretionary spending and our revenue could suffer. If we are unable to convert non-paying players into paying players, or if we are unable to retain our paying players or if the average amount of revenue that we generate from our players does not increase or declines, our business may not grow, our financial results will suffer, and our stock price may decline.\nWe have depended on a small number of growth games for a significant portion of our revenue in recent fiscal periods. If these games do not continue to grow or we do not release highly successful new games, our revenue would decline.\nIn the mobile gaming industry, new games are frequently introduced, but a relatively small number of games account for a significant portion of industry sales. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of games, although the games in that group have shifted over time. Our top three titles for the year ended December 31, 2020, Design Home, the Tap Sports Baseball franchise, and Covet Fashion, each accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in the period and collectively generated approximately 71.0% of our revenue during the period, while our top three titles for the year ended December 31, 2019, Design Home, the Tap Sports Baseball franchise, and Covet\nFashion, each accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in the period and collectively generated approximately 78.4% of our revenue during the period. We expect our dependency on a small number of games, and in particular Design Home, for a majority of our revenue will continue for the foreseeable future. The current COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the delay and shortening of the 2020 Major League Baseball season, which we believe at least somewhat negatively impacted downloads of and revenue from our MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2020 game. If the 2021 Major League Baseball season is similarly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, it could negatively impact the financial performance of our upcoming MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2021 game. In addition, if we are unable to grow bookings from Disney Sorcerer\u2019s Arena or Diner DASH Adventures so that they become growth games, or if any games that we launch in the near future are not successful, it could result in an overall decline in our revenue and cause us to continue to rely primarily on our existing growth games for a significant majority of revenue for the foreseeable future.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with each of Apple and Google or if either of these storefronts were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.\nThe majority of our smartphone revenue has historically been derived from Apple\u2019s iOS platform, which accounted for 61.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 60.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We generated the majority of this iOS-related revenue from the Apple App Store, which represented 56.2% and 54.4% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We generated the balance of our iOS-related revenue from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store. In addition, we derived approximately 38.4% and 39.1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from the Android platform. We generated the majority of our Android-related revenue from the Google Play Store, which represented 32.9% and 33.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We believe that we have good relationships with each of Apple and Google, which have contributed to the majority of our games released in the last several years being featured on their respective storefronts upon worldwide commercial release. If we do not continue to receive prominent featuring, users may find it more difficult to discover our games and we may not generate significant revenue from them. We may also be required to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns to generate substantial revenue on these platforms. Additionally, our efforts to advertise through search advertisements in the Apple App Store may not be successful and may not result in additional users or monetization. In addition, currently neither Apple nor Google charge a publisher when it features one of their apps. If either Apple or Google were to charge publishers to feature an app, it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably. Accordingly, any change or deterioration in our relationship with Apple or Google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe also rely on the continued functioning of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. In the past, these Digital Storefronts have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality. If such events recur on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenue from these storefronts, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. In addition, if the storefront operators fail to provide high levels of service, our players\u2019 ability to access our games may be interrupted or players may not receive the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand, revenue and operating results.\nThe operators of Digital Storefronts on which we publish our free-to-play games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others\u2019 contracts with them.\nWe distribute our free-to-play games through direct-to-consumer Digital Storefronts, for which the distribution terms and conditions are often \u201cclick through\u201d agreements that we are not able to negotiate with the storefront operator. For example, we are subject to each of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s standard click-through terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of apps, including our games, on their storefronts. Each of Apple and Google can unilaterally change its standard terms and conditions, including platform commission fees, with no prior notice to us. In addition, the agreement terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator. Further, these storefront operators typically have the right to prohibit a\ndeveloper from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions. For example, in April 2019, Apple enforced new guidelines relating to offerwalls which has negatively impacted our revenue from offers in our games; Apple enforced similar guidelines with respect to offerwalls in January 2018 relating to Design Home. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Apple updated its terms of service to require publishers to disclose a player\u2019s odds of winning the various items contained within loot boxes, and in May 2019 Google updated its terms of service to require substantially similar disclosure. Glu utilizes loot boxes in many of its current games and some of the games it intends to release in the future, and it is possible that these disclosure requirements will negatively impact the monetization of these titles. If Apple or Google, or any other key storefront operator, determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms and conditions, by a new interpretation or otherwise, or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront, it would materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline.\nFurthermore, any changes to the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players, including any changes by Facebook of its advertising platform, which we rely on for a majority of our user acquisition activities, could negatively impact our revenue or otherwise materially harm our business, and we may not receive significant or any advance warning of such changes.\nThe manufacturers of mobile devices on which our free-to-play games can be played have the unilateral ability to change the hardware or software of their devices which may negatively affect our business.\nOur games are played on mobile devices manufactured by third parties. We have no influence on the hardware or software of these devices and any changes to them might negatively impact our business. Mobile devices contain IDFAs which currently are shared with the publishers of the applications on a mobile device. Publishers use these IDFAs for a variety of business purposes, among others for measuring advertising, generating advertising revenue, performing application user level analytics, and targeting users in marketing campaigns. Apple has announced that starting in early Spring 2021, the IDFAs of Apple\u2019s mobile devices will no longer be available by default to mobile application publishers. Instead, the IDFA will only be accessible to the application publisher if a user gives the publisher permission to access his or her IDFA by expressly consenting to this access. We expect only a minority of users will consent to us accessing their IDFA. This may lead to a number of challenges including:\n\u25cfwe may have difficulty measuring the effectiveness of individual user acquisition campaigns;\n\u25cfwe may have difficulty optimizing user acquisition campaigns to deliver return on investment;\n\u25cfwe may have difficulty projecting the potential return of individual user acquisition campaigns;\n\u25cfwe may see a negative impact to our advertising revenue;\n\u25cfwe may encounter challenges migrating from IDFA to other identifiers for the purposes of analytics thereby introducing risk to our core data infrastructure;\n\u25cfwe may have difficulties formulating new marketing strategies that are as effective as the IDFA-driven marketing strategies we currently employ; and\n\u25cfwe may encounter delays in obtaining Apple\u2019s approval when submitting new games and updates to our existing games to the App Store, which may impact our live operations schedule and ability to deliver updated features and content to our players.\nThese challenges might negatively impact our revenue or otherwise materially harm our business. Other manufacturers of mobile devices may also implement similar changes, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe derive revenue from advertisements and offers that are incorporated into our free-to-play games through relationships with third parties. If we lose the ability to provide these advertisements and offers for any reason, if we become victim to advertising fraud or if any events occur that negatively impact the revenue we receive from these sources, it would negatively impact our operating results.\nIn addition to in-app purchases, we derive revenue from our free-to-play games through advertisements and offers; for the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 10.9% of our total revenues from advertisements and offers. We incorporate advertisements and offers into our games by implementing third parties\u2019 software development kits. We rely on these third parties to provide us with a sufficient inventory of advertisements and offers to meet the demand of our user base. If we exhaust the available inventory of these third parties, it will negatively impact our revenue. If our relationship with any of these third parties terminates for any reason, or if the commercial terms of our relationships do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, we would need to locate and implement other third party solutions, which could negatively impact our revenue, at least in the short term. In addition, we may be susceptible to various types of advertising fraud, which could reduce the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or cause us to pay money to advertising firms for installations that were wrongly attributed to such firms. While we have implemented measures to detect and prevent advertising fraud, such measures may not prove effective, which would harm our user acquisition efforts and could harm our revenue. Some players of our games also use various techniques in an attempt to circumvent limits on the number of advertisements that players can watch in a given period in order to earn extra virtual currency, which might negatively affect the economy of our games. Furthermore, the revenue that we derive from advertisements and offers is subject to seasonality, as companies\u2019 advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which negatively impacts our revenue in the first quarter.\nThe actions of the storefront operators can also negatively impact the revenue that we generate from advertisements and offers. For example, in April 2019, Apple enforced new guidelines relating to offerwalls which has negatively impacted our revenue from offers in our games; Apple enforced similar guidelines with respect to offerwalls in January 2018 relating to Design Home. Any similar changes in the future that impact our revenue that we generate from advertisements and offers could materially harm our business.\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive for us to acquire players for our games and we may not achieve a positive return on investment on our user acquisition efforts.\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive for us to acquire players for our games for a variety of reasons, including the increasingly competitive nature of the mobile gaming industry and the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating to competing entertainment options, including social media and other non-gaming applications. In addition, we believe that changes that Apple has implemented during the last several years to its platform, particularly the removal of the Top Grossing rankings and decreasing the prominence of the Top Free rankings, has negatively impacted the number of organic downloads of our games. These factors have contributed to an overall decline in our daily and monthly active users for our existing games as well as fewer players downloading our new games than in the past despite our substantially increased spending on user acquisition efforts. For example, our launch of Diner DASH Adventures in June 2019 resulted in significantly fewer downloads than prior versions of our Dash franchise such as Cooking Dash and Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay. If the number of players who download our new title launches scheduled for 2021 does not meet our expectations, in particular for Table & Taste and the next iteration of our Deer Hunter franchise, our revenue and operating results will suffer. Our existing successful growth games are not immune to these trends, as we experienced significantly higher CPIs (costs per install) for Design Home and Covet Fashion during the first half of 2019 due to substantial increases in spending by several competitors, which negatively impacted the revenue and margins for these titles. Furthermore, our spending on user acquisition is designed so that we will achieve a positive return on investment - that is, we expect that the amount we spend to acquire users in our games will be less than the revenue we ultimately generate from such acquired users. In order to determine the expected revenue from acquired users who may play our games for multiple years, we often must make certain assumptions about their projected spending behavior, particularly for games like Disney Sorcerer\u2019s Arena for which we did not have similar games in our portfolio to\naid us in our modeling efforts. To the extent that we do not achieve a positive return on investment on our user acquisition spending, it will negatively impact our margins and overall operating results.\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict, which in turn could cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict our future revenue or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are to a large extent fixed. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue, and even a small shortfall in revenue could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter.\nIn addition to other factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly results and the volatility in our stock price include:\n\u25cfour ability to increase the number of our paying players and the amount that each paying player spends in our games;\n\u25cfthe popularity and monetization rates of our new games released during the quarter and the ability of games released in prior periods to sustain their popularity and monetization rates;\n\u25cfthe number and timing of new games and significant updates released by us and our competitors, particularly those games that may represent a significant portion of our revenue in a quarter, which timing can be impacted by internal development delays, longer than anticipated beta testing periods, shifts in product strategy and how quickly Digital Storefront operators review and approve our games for commercial release;\n\u25cfchanges in the prominence of storefront featuring for our games and those of our competitors;\n\u25cfthe loss of, or changes to, one of our distribution platforms;\n\u25cfchanges to the Apple iOS platform or the Google Android platform to which we are not able to adapt our game offerings;\n\u25cffluctuations in the size and rate of growth of overall consumer demand for smartphones, tablets, games and related content;\n\u25cfthe amount and timing of charges related to any future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, prepaid royalties and guarantees;\n\u25cfchanges in the mix of revenue derived from games based on original intellectual property versus licensed intellectual property;\n\u25cfchanges in the mix of revenue derived from in-app purchases, advertisements and offers, which mix often depends on the nature of new titles launched during the quarter;\n\u25cfchanges in the amount of money we spend marketing our titles in a particular quarter, including the average amount we pay to acquire each new user, as well as changes in the timing of these marketing expenses within the quarter;\n\u25cfdecisions by us to incur additional expenses, such as increases in research and development, restructuring expenses, or unanticipated increases in vendor-related costs, such as hosting fees;\n\u25cfthe timing of successful mobile device launches;\n\u25cfthe seasonality of our industry;\n\u25cfchanges in accounting rules, such as those governing recognition of revenue, including the period of time over which we recognize revenue for in-app purchases of virtual currency and goods within some of our games, as well as estimates of average playing periods and player life;\n\u25cfthe activities, announcements and performance of our commercial partners: and\n\u25cfmacro-economic fluctuations in the United States and global economies, including those that impact discretionary consumer spending such as may result from the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe may not, or may be unable to, renew our existing content licenses when they expire and may not choose to obtain additional licenses or be able to obtain new licenses on favorable terms, which could negatively impact our revenue if we fail to replace such revenue with revenue from games based on our own intellectual property.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 36.2% of our revenue from games that are based on or substantially incorporate third-party intellectual property, such as the Tap Sports Baseball franchise, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, and Disney Sorcerer\u2019s Arena. We expect to continue to derive significant revenue from these titles in 2021 and beyond. Certain of our licenses expire at various times during the next several years, and we may be unable to renew these licenses on terms favorable to us or at all, and we may have difficulties obtaining licenses from new content owners on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these licensors could decide to license to our competitors or develop and publish their own mobile games, competing with us in the marketplace. We also license certain brands and their assets for our Covet Fashion and Design Home titles without the provision of a license fee or royalty. These licensors could decide to no longer license their assets under the current terms, and to instead charge a one-time payment, ongoing royalty or both, which may adversely affect the profitability of these titles. Failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses or to obtain additional licenses would prevent us from continuing to offer our current licensed games and introducing new mobile games based on such licensed content, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSecuring license agreements to develop, publish and market games based on or significantly incorporating celebrities, third-party licensed brands, properties, and other content typically requires that we make minimum guaranteed royalty and other payments to such licensors, and to the extent such payments become impaired, our operating results would be harmed.\nIn connection with partnerships with celebrities and other licensors of third-party brands, properties and content, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant minimum guaranteed royalty and other payments. As a result, we may incur impairments on such payments if our forecasts for these games are lower than we anticipated at the time we entered into the agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we had remaining prepaid royalty balances totaling $28.8 million. We expect to continue to selectively license third-party licensed brands, properties and other content and to pay minimum guaranteed royalty payments in connection with such deals. As a result, we may be required to take impairments in future periods if the games we are developing that have significant contractual minimum guarantee commitments associated with them are not successful.\nIf we do not successfully establish and maintain awareness of our brand and games, if we fail to develop high-quality, engaging games that are differentiated from our prior games, if we incur excessive expenses maintaining and promoting our brand or our games or if our games contain defects or objectionable content, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our brand is critical to establishing, developing and maintaining favorable relationships with players, distributors, content licensors, platform providers, advertisers and key talent. Increasing awareness of our brand and recognition of our games is particularly important in connection with our strategic focus of developing games based on our own intellectual property. Our ability to promote the Glu brand and increase recognition of our games depends on our ability to develop high-quality, engaging games, including integrating the level\nof social and community features appropriate for a game\u2019s target audience and partnering with brands with fan bases that can support successful mobile games. If consumers, Digital Storefront owners, and branded content owners, do not perceive our existing games as high-quality, or if we introduce new games that are not favorably received by them, then we may not succeed in building brand recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace. In addition, globalizing and extending our brand and recognition of our games is costly and involves extensive management time to execute successfully. Although we make significant sales and marketing expenditures in connection with the launch of our games, these efforts may not succeed in increasing awareness of our brand or the new games. If we fail to maintain and increase brand awareness and consumer recognition of our games, our potential revenue could be limited, our costs could increase and our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nIn addition, if a game contains objectionable content, we could experience damage to our reputation and brand. Our games may contain violence or other content that some consumers may find objectionable, particularly in light of high-profile mass shootings. For example, many of our shooter games, including our Deer Hunter games, have a 17-and-older rating on the Apple App Store due to its violence. Despite these ratings, consumers may be offended by some of our game content and children to whom these games are not targeted may choose to play them without parental permission nonetheless. In addition, our employees or employees of outside developers could include hidden features in our games without our knowledge, which might contain profanity, graphic violence, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material. Users of our games, particularly games with social messaging features, may utilize these features for illegal purposes or target certain users through these features. If consumers believe that a game we published contains objectionable content or may expose them to nefarious individuals, it could harm our brand, consumers could refuse to download it or demand a refund for any in-app purchases and could pressure the Digital Storefront operators to no longer allow us to publish the game on their platforms. Similarly, if any of our games are introduced with defects, vulnerabilities or have playability issues, we may receive negative user reviews, our brand may be damaged, and our operating results and revenue negatively affected. For example, our attempt to relaunch our Racing Rivals title, which had experienced playability and user interface issues in the past, in the second quarter of 2018 by introducing new features and resetting the economy of the game resulted in the game crashing and not being available to most users for several days. As a result, the daily active users of Racing Rivals and the revenue that we generated from this title significantly decreased from peak levels which contributed to our decision to shut down the game effective April 2019. In addition, any issues relating to our games could be exacerbated if our customer service department does not timely and adequately address issues that our players have encountered with our games.\nWe use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games. If we experience any prolonged technical issues with this engine or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause our financial results to fall below expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games, and we expect to continue to use this engine for the foreseeable future. Because we do not own this engine, we do not control its operation or maintenance, nor do we control how the engine is updated or upgraded. As a result, any prolonged technical issues with this engine might not be resolved quickly, despite the fact that we have contractual service level commitments from Unity. In addition, to the extent that we require any functionality that is not offered by Unity we are dependent on Unity to update or upgrade its engine to offer such functionality. Furthermore, although Unity cannot terminate our agreement absent an uncured material breach of the agreement by us, we could lose access to this engine under certain circumstances, such as a natural disaster that impacts Unity or a bankruptcy event. If we experience any prolonged issues with the operation of the Unity game development engine, if the Unity game development engine does not offer the functionality we require or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause us to not meet revenue expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline. Further, if one of our competitors acquired Unity, the acquiring company would be less likely to renew our agreement, which could impact our game development efforts in the future, particularly with respect to sequels to games that were created on the Unity engine.\nWe rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nCertain of our key metrics, including the number of our daily and monthly active users, our average revenue per daily user and the average useful life of our paying players, is calculated using internal company data from multiple analytics systems that have not been independently verified. The calculation of these metrics is described in detail under the heading titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operating Metrics.\u201d While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics across our large user base around the world. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy, but these efforts may not prove successful and we may discover material inaccuracies. In addition, our methodology for calculating these metrics may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate similar metrics. For example, we currently treat an individual who plays two different Glu games on the same day or who plays the same game on two different devices during the same day (e.g., iPhone and an iPad) as two active users for each such day when we average or aggregate active users over time. As such, the calculations of our active users may not precisely reflect the actual number of people using our titles. We may also discover unexpected errors in our internal data that resulted from technical or other errors. Furthermore, our Crowdstar studio utilizes a separate analytics system from the rest of our company, which could result in internal inconsistencies or errors. If we determine that any of our metrics are not accurate, we may be required to revise or cease reporting such metrics and it may harm our reputation and business.\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.\nOur future success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate our key personnel, namely our management team, creative leaders and experienced game development personnel. In particular, Nick Earl, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is critical to our vision, strategic direction, products and technology, and the continued retention of the other members of our senior management team is important to our continued success. In addition, to grow our business, execute on our business strategy and replace departing employees, we must identify, hire and retain qualified personnel, particularly experienced monetization, live operations, server technology, software and data engineer, game designer, data analyst, user experience, economist, and product management personnel to develop and support our growth games. Attracting and retaining key personnel and other staff is difficult in a competitive hiring market, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are headquartered, and we may not succeed in doing so. The gaming and technology industries are also traditionally male dominated, so it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain talented female personnel who may be needed to help us optimize our games that are targeted to a more female-focused audience, including our games in the lifestyle and casual genres. Volatility of our stock price, changes in our compensation structure for our executive officers that significantly relies on performance linked stock awards, and previous headcount reductions may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain top talent. In particular, should our stock price decline it might be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel, since individuals may elect to seek employment with other companies that they believe have better long-term prospects or that present better opportunities for earning equity-based compensation. Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, and our management and key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time. In addition, uncertainty related to our recently announced planned acquisition by Electronic Arts may result in uncertainty for some of our employees and could increase the likelihood that other companies will be able to recruit away our key employees. We do not maintain a key-person life insurance policy on any of our officers. Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.\nWe have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future and may not achieve and sustain profitability or growth in future periods.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $411.2 million. While we generated net income of $20.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, we may not be successful in sustaining profitability and growing our net income in future periods. We have conducted several restructurings in the past, which measures were aimed at reducing our fixed costs and operating more efficiently. However, our costs may continue to rise as we implement additional initiatives designed to increase revenue, potentially including: investing more heavily in our existing growth games as part of our product strategy; increasing our spending on\nuser acquisition efforts, particularly for our growth games and our new title launches, and on growth initiatives including customer relationship management and predictive analytics; hiring additional staff in all of our offices worldwide; developing new games with greater complexity, higher production values and deeper social features; running live operations on our games; and taking other steps to strengthen our company.\nWe anticipate that the costs of acquiring new players and otherwise marketing our games will continue to rise, particularly since advertising costs in our industry have generally been rising and we have encountered increasing difficulties in generating downloads of our games as users spend more time on alternative software applications, such as social media, messaging, and streaming applications. We may also continue to incur significant costs to acquire rights to third party intellectual property, including incurring significant minimum guaranteed royalty payments. If our revenue does not increase at a rate sufficient to offset these additional expenses, if the launch dates for our games are delayed, if we do not realize a sufficient return on our user acquisition spending for our growth games, if we experience unexpected significant increases in operating expenses or if we are required to take additional charges related to impairments or restructurings, we will continue to incur losses. Furthermore, given the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating to social media and other non-gaming applications, increasing revenue may be challenging.\nOur business will suffer if our acquisition and strategic investment activities are unsuccessful or disrupt our ongoing business, which may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe have acquired and invested in, and may in the future acquire and invest in, companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction. Acquisitions and investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cfdiversion of management\u2019s time and a shift of focus from operating the business to issues related to negotiation of acquisition or investment terms, integration and administration;\n\u25cfour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u25cfpotential employee morale and retention issues resulting from any reductions in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, or future prospects;\n\u25cfpotential product development delays resulting from any changes and disruptions that may follow the acquisition;\n\u25cfsignificant competition from other acquirers and investors as the gaming industry consolidates and challenges in offering attractive consideration given the volatility of our stock price and potential difficulties in obtaining alternative financing;\n\u25cfchallenges retaining the key employees, customers and other business partners of the acquired or investee business;\n\u25cf our ability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition or strategic investment;\n\u25cf an impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets or investments in future periods would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the write-down occurs, such as the case with the impairment charge for acquired in-process research and development recorded in the third quarter of 2018;\n\u25cf the internal control environment of an acquired or investee entity may not be consistent with our standards and may require significant time and resources to improve;\n\u25cf in the case of foreign acquisitions or strategic investments, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u25cf liability for activities of the acquired or investee companies before the acquisition or investment, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, accounting standards and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf harm to our brand and reputation; and\n\u25cf harm to our existing business relationships with business partners and advertisers as a result of the acquisition.\nAcquisitions may be particularly challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we would likely not be able to travel to conduct in-person meetings and due diligence sessions with potential target companies. In addition, if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition or strategic investment, as we did for our acquisitions of Griptonite, Inc., Blammo Games Inc., GameSpy Industries, Inc., PlayFirst, Inc. and Cie Games, Inc., our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted. We may also need to raise additional capital in the event we use a significant amount of cash as consideration in an acquisition. Because acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition.\nAny restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect, and these actions may adversely affect our business.\nDuring the last several years we have implemented restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies. Some of our previous restructurings included reductions in personnel in Bellevue, Washington; San Francisco, California; Long Beach, California; Portland, Oregon; Toronto, Canada; and Beijing, China, as well as the divestiture of our Moscow, Russia game development studio. Any future restructurings or divestitures could result in disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our business. For example, in connection with the divestiture of our Moscow studio, we transitioned certain titles that were developed or operated by the Moscow studio, including Deer Hunter 2018, to our Hyderabad, India studio. We have seen a decline in revenue from Deer Hunter 2018, which may in part be related to this transition. In addition, we cannot be sure that any cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining. If our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our operating results will suffer.\nWe may not realize the benefits expected through our strategic relationship with Tencent and other aspects of the relationship could have adverse effects on our business.\nIn April 2015, we entered into a strategic relationship with Tencent, a leading Internet company in China and arguably the world\u2019s largest gaming company. Tencent, through a controlled affiliate, agreed to invest $126.0 million in exchange for approximately 16.3% of our total outstanding common stock on a post-transaction basis. In November 2015, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Tencent to license and publish its game, WeFire, in the United States and international markets outside of Asia under the name Rival Fire, which we launched in July 2016. In light of the poor performance of the title in terms of monetization and downloads, and the related contractual prepaid royalty commitments and license fees under our agreement with the affiliate of Tencent, we impaired $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. We may not succeed in entering into any other agreements or operating partnerships with Tencent in the future. Even if we do enter into any operational partnerships, it could take months to years to fully realize the benefits of such partnerships or they may not be successful as was the case with WeFire.\nTencent, through its controlled affiliates, held approximately 12.1% of the aggregate voting power of our common stock as of December 31, 2020, and could acquire up to 25.0% of the voting power through open-market purchases of our common stock. While Tencent has agreed to cause these shares to be voted with the majority recommendation of the\nindependent members of our board of directors on most matters, Tencent could have considerable influence over matters such as approving a potential acquisition of us; Tencent has signed a voting agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to vote its shares of our common stock in favor of our acquisition by Electronic Arts. Tencent was also granted the right to designate a member of our board of directors, and currently Ben Feder, Tencent\u2019s President of International Partnerships (North America), is Tencent\u2019s representative on our board of directors. Mr. Feder or any future Tencent designee could have an actual or apparent conflict of interest in such matters.\nOur reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. The frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate, including conversion to unified international accounting standards. Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further significantly affect, the way we account for revenue. For example, the accounting for revenue derived from free-to-play games, particularly with regard to revenue generated from online Digital Storefronts, is still evolving and, in some cases, uncertain. While we believe that we are correctly accounting for our revenue, this is an area that continues to involve significant discussion among accounting professionals and the future changes to the standard may cause our operating results to fluctuate. In addition, we currently defer revenue related to virtual goods and currency over the average playing period of paying users, which approximates the estimated weighted average useful life of the transaction. While we believe our estimates are reasonable based on available game player information, we may revise such estimates in the future in the event the average playing period of our paying users changes. Any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual items would be applied to the current quarter and prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns of our paying users. Any changes in our estimates of useful lives of these virtual items may result in our revenue being recognized on a basis different from prior periods\u2019 and may cause our operating results to fluctuate. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. If we are unable to maintain such internal controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls as required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would require a restatement, and investor confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\nConversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our ERP system, and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with, and therefore harm, our business and operations.\nWe underwent a multi-phase project that began in 2016 to convert certain key internal business systems and processes, including our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to a cloud based system. In connection with the transition to our new ERP system, we shutdown certain of our legacy ERP systems in the third quarter of 2016, which affected certain of our processes in the second half of 2016 and may continue to impact our processes. While we have transitioned to our new ERP system, we may need to resolve issues that arise in connection with this transition. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these business systems and processes. Any problems in the functioning of the new systems or processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to process payments, record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. Even if we encounter these adverse effects, as noted above, the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be more time consuming than we anticipated and could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the mobile games market is disrupted by new technologies and we are not able to appropriately adapt our business, our business will suffer.\nThe mobile games market could be disrupted by new technologies that could impact our business. For example, the introduction of 5G wireless networking will offer technological advancements like faster download speeds and lower latency. While these technological advancements will provide opportunities for our business, it may also create risks if we do not adapt to these new technologies in a quick and timely manner. For example, 5G technology may result in the proliferation of game streaming services. Multiple instances of new cloud gaming services are already commercially available and new entrants like Google and Microsoft have announced their ability to stream games to mobile devices. Some of these new streaming entrants will also choose to publish first-party content on their platforms. Streaming technology could potentially disrupt the mobile gaming industry by enabling companies to publish cross-platform games that users can play across multiple platforms and devices. This could result in consumers choosing to play these cross-platform games rather than our games which are currently only available on mobile devices. If we do not appropriately adapt our business to new technologies, our business will suffer.\nIf we fail to deliver our games at the same time as new mobile devices are commercially introduced, our revenue may suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on the commercial introduction of new mobile devices with enhanced features, including larger, higher resolution color screens, improved audio quality, and greater processing power, memory, battery life and storage. For example, the introduction of new and more powerful versions of Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad and devices based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, have helped drive the growth of the mobile games market. We do not control the timing of these device launches. Some manufacturers give us access to their new devices prior to commercial release. If one or more major manufacturers were to stop providing us access to new device models prior to commercial release, we might be unable to introduce games that are compatible with the new device when the device is first commercially released, and we might be unable to make compatible games for a substantial period following the device release. If we do not adequately build into our title plan the demand for games for a particular mobile device, experience game launch delays, or miss the opportunity to sell games when new mobile devices are shipped or our end users upgrade to a new mobile device, our revenue would likely decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would likely suffer.\nIf the mobile gaming market does not continue to grow, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of the mobile gaming market. The mobile gaming market has experienced significant revenue growth during the last several years despite an overall flattening of downloads of games on the appstores. The mobile gaming industry may not continue to grow at historical rates which could negatively impact our business. In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms.\nChanges to digital platforms\u2019 rules relating to \u201cloot boxes,\u201d or the potential adoption of regulations or legislation impacting loot boxes, could require us to make changes to some of our games\u2019 economies or design, which could negatively impact the monetization of these games and harm our revenue.\nIn December 2017, Apple updated its terms of service to require publishers of applications that include \u201cloot boxes\u201d to disclose the odds of receiving each type of item within each loot box to customers prior to purchase, and Google similarly updated its terms of service in May 2019. Loot boxes are a commonly used monetization technique in free-to-play mobile games in which a player can acquire a virtual loot box, typically through game play or by using virtual currency, but the player does not know which virtual item(s) he or she will receive (which may be a common, rare or extremely rare item, and may be a duplicate of an item the player already has in his or her inventory) until the loot box is opened. The player will always receive one or more virtual items when he or she opens the loot box, but the player does not know exactly which item(s) until the loot box is opened. We utilize loot boxes in some of our top games including our Tap Sports Baseball franchise, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Disney Sorcerer\u2019s Arena, and we intend to use loot boxes in certain of our upcoming games that we expect to launch in 2021, including Deer Hunter World. We have\nupdated our applicable games to comply with Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s rules relating to loot boxes and do not believe that this has had a material impact on the monetization of our games that utilize loot boxes. However, in the event that Apple or Google changes its terms of service to include more onerous requirements or if Apple or Google were to prohibit the use of loot boxes in games distributed on its digital platform, it would require us to redesign the economies of the affected games and would likely cause our revenue generated from these games to decline. In April 2018, each of the Belgian Gaming Commission and the Dutch Gambling Authority declared that loot boxes as implemented in certain of the games that they reviewed constituted illegal gambling under its respective laws. While neither of these bodies reviewed any of our games, we may be required to modify the implementation of loot boxes to continue utilizing loot boxes in these jurisdictions, remove loot boxes from our games published in these jurisdictions or cease publishing games containing loot boxes in these jurisdictions. In addition, the FTC held a public workshop in August 2019 to examine, and released a staff paper in August 2020 summarizing, consumer protection issues related to loot boxes, and various other jurisdictions, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the states of California, Hawaii, Minnesota and Washington, are reviewing or have indicated that they intend to review the legality of loot boxes and whether they constitute gambling. Furthermore, in May 2019, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley, Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal introduced a bill to the Senate that would prohibit loot boxes and pay-to-win micro-transactions in \u201cminor oriented\u201d games. To the extent that a federal law, the FTC, or other jurisdictions determine that loot boxes constitute gambling, or they otherwise elect to regulate the use of loot boxes, it could require us to stop utilizing loot boxes within our games that are distributed in such territories, which would negatively impact our revenue. We could also become subject to private litigation relating to loot boxes, as in August 2020, when a class action lawsuit was filed against Supercell in California alleging that the loot boxes in two of Supercell\u2019s games violate California\u2019s gambling statutes, and in September 2020, when a class action lawsuit was filed against Electronic Arts in Canada alleging that the loot boxes in more than 60 of Electronic Arts\u2019 games violate Canadian gambling laws.\nOur business is subject to increasing governmental regulation. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.\nWe are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution. In the United States, for example, numerous federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of games. Legislation has been adopted in several states, and proposed at the federal level, regulating the ability to offer certain games to minors. If such legislation is adopted, it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting the size of the potential market for our games. In addition, there have been calls from U.S. government officials to examine violence in video games in light of high-profile mass shootings. We may also be required to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our games, for example to comply with labeling requirements for our free-to-play games. Additionally, if the FTC or any other significant regulatory body issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases or any other key aspect of our business, it would significantly impact our business strategy. In addition, self-regulatory bodies in the United States (the Entertainment Software Rating Board) and foreign jurisdictions (such as the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) in the European Union) provide consumers with rating information on various products such as entertainment software similar to our games based on the content (for example, violence, sexually explicit content, language). Furthermore, as of December 31, 2020, Chinese law requires publishers to obtain an approval number from China\u2019s National Press and Publication Administration in order to distribute games in mainland China. We are currently not seeking to obtain such approval numbers and therefore do not currently distribute our games through the Apple App Store in mainland China. Increasing governmental regulation could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers, by limiting the size of the potential market for our products, or by requiring costly additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations. Furthermore, the growth and development of free-to-play gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and that we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional\nregulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may dampen the growth of free-to-play gaming and impair our business.\nWe offer our players various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional opportunities, and have in the past allowed players to compete against each other in tournaments for cash prizes. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. For example, a March 2018 ruling from the 9th Circuit found that the mobile social casino game Big Fish Casino constituted gambling under Washington state law, and in August 2020, the defendants in such lawsuit agreed to pay $155 million to settle the class action lawsuit. Any future court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.\nIn addition, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.\n\u201cCheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings or actions by unrelated third parties that seek to exploit our games and players affect the game-playing experience and may lead players to stop playing our games or divert revenue to unrelated third parties.\nUnrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, \u201ccheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that may decrease our revenue generated from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us. Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain virtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly. Unrelated third parties attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. In addition, we are exploring the extension of Tap Sports Baseball and Design Home to the PC web browser, and a browser-enabled version of these titles may contain vulnerabilities that we don\u2019t anticipate which could significantly impact their revenue. We devote resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so in a prompt and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted, our reputation damaged and players may play our games less frequently or stop playing our games altogether. This may lead to lost revenue from paying players, increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and activities, legal claims, and increased customer service costs needed to respond to disgruntled players.\nSome of our players may make sales or purchases of virtual goods used in our games through unauthorized or fraudulent third-party websites, which may reduce our revenue.\nVirtual goods in our games have no monetary value outside of our games. Nonetheless, some of our players may make sales and/or purchases of our virtual goods, such as virtual currency for our Tap Sports Baseball games, through unauthorized third-party sellers in exchange for real currency. These unauthorized or fraudulent transactions are usually arranged on third-party websites and the virtual goods offered may have been obtained through unauthorized means such as exploiting vulnerabilities in our games, from scamming our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits, or from credit card fraud. We do not generate any revenue from these transactions. These unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party sellers could reduce our revenue by, among other things:\n\u25cf decreasing revenue from authorized transactions;\n\u25cf creating downward pressure on the prices we charge players for our virtual currency;\n\u25cf increasing chargebacks from unauthorized credit card transactions;\n\u25cf causing us to lose revenue from dissatisfied players who stop playing a particular game;\n\u25cf increasing costs we incur to develop technological measures to curtail unauthorized transactions;\n\u25cf resulting in negative publicity or harm our reputation with players and partners; and\n\u25cf increasing customer support costs to respond to dissatisfied players.\nTo discourage unauthorized purchases and sales of our virtual goods, we state in our terms of service that the buying or selling of virtual currency and virtual goods from unauthorized third party sellers may result in bans from our games or legal action. We have banned players as a result of such activities. We have also employed technological measures to help detect unauthorized transactions and continue to develop additional methods and processes by which we can identify unauthorized transactions and block such transactions. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to prevent or minimize these unauthorized or fraudulent transactions will be successful.\nWe are, and in the future may become a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are, and may become in the future, subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory inquiries that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, potential negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, events may occur that give rise to a potential risk of litigation. The number and significance of regulatory inquiries have increased as our business has grown and evolved. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business, require us to change our business practices or products, require significant amounts of management time, result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nWe rely on a combination of our own servers and technology and third party infrastructure to operate our games, and a significant portion of our game traffic is hosted by a single vendor. If we experience any system or network failures, unexpected technical problems, cyber attacks or any other interruption to our games, it could reduce our sales, increase costs, or result in a loss of revenue or loss of end users of our games.\nWe rely on our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our games, and we expect that our reliance on such third-party infrastructure and our technology platform will increase as we continue to add additional social features and functionality into our games. We do not control these third parties and replacing them might require significant time and expense. In particular, a significant portion of our game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services, which service provides server redundancy and uses multiple locations on various distinct power grids. Amazon may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days\u2019 notice. In addition, Amazon has experienced brief power outages on occasion during the past several years that have affected the availability of certain of our games during such outages. While none of these events adversely impacted our business, a similar outage of a longer duration could. Any technical problem with cyber-attack on, or loss of access to these third parties\u2019 or our systems, servers or other technologies, including our technology platform, could result in the inability of end users to download or play our games, cause interruption to gameplay, prevent the completion of billing for a game or result in the loss of users\u2019 virtual currency or other in-app purchases, interfere with access to some aspects of our games or result in the theft of end-user personal information. For example, in the second quarter of 2018, our efforts to relaunch Racing Rivals resulted in the game crashing and not being available to most users for several days. If users are unable to access and play our games for any period of time, if virtual assets are lost, or if users do not receive their purchased virtual currency, we may receive negative publicity and game ratings, we may lose players of our games, we may be required to issue refunds, and we may become subject to regulatory investigation or class action litigation, any of which would negatively affect our business. Any of these problems could require us to incur substantial repair costs, distract management from operating our business and result in a loss of revenue. Furthermore, our disaster recovery systems and those of third-parties with which we do business may not function as intended or may fail to adequately protect our critical business information in the event of a significant business interruption, which may cause interruption in service of our games, security breaches or the loss of data or functionality, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCyber attacks, security breaches, and computer viruses could harm our business, reputation, brand and operating results.\nCyber-attacks, security breaches, and computer viruses have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. We store sensitive information, including personal information about our employees. In addition, our games involve the storage and transmission of players\u2019 personal information in our facilities and on our equipment, networks and corporate systems run by us or managed by third-parties including Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. Our player data, corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data, our employees\u2019 data, our players\u2019 data or any third party data we may possess. For example, we recently became aware of security breaches involving various government agencies and private companies caused by software developed by SolarWinds. While we are a customer of SolarWinds, we have not found any evidence of an impact from the SolarWinds incident. In addition, outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose information in order to gain access to this data. Any such incidents, particularly of longer duration, could damage our brand and reputation and result in a material loss of revenue. Given the global nature of our business and the low cost, relative ease and proliferation of internet enabled devices, we may be at an increased risk for cyber-attacks and, specifically, denial of service attacks. In addition, the chat and other social features in our games could potentially be used by terrorist organizations or other criminals to communicate or for other nefarious purposes, which could severely damage our brand and reputation. If an actual or perceived security breach of our or a third-party system on which we rely occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose players and advertisers, and we could suffer significant legal and financial harm including loss of revenue due to such events or in connection with remediation efforts and costs, investigation costs or penalties, litigation, regulatory and enforcement actions, compliance with notification obligations, changed security and system protection measures. Any of these actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nThe laws and regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users, which laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The U.S. government, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over collecting information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became operative in January 2020 and was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act in December 2020, and other laws, like the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, create new individual privacy rights and impose worldwide obligations on companies handling personal data, which has resulted, or will result, in a greater compliance burden for us and other companies and could result in us incurring substantial monetary penalties if we are found to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Various U.S. state and federal regulators have also continued to expand the scope of data elements worthy of, and subject to, privacy protections, creating a multi-layered regulation regime that may be applicable to our business and will require time and resources to address. Additionally, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. If we do not follow existing laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators, with respect to privacy-related matters, or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices, even if unfounded, it could damage our reputation and operating results. Furthermore, new or the interpretation of existing laws, policies, or industry codes could prevent us from offering, or make it costlier or more difficult to offer services in certain jurisdiction.\nAll of our games are subject to our privacy policy and our terms of service located on our corporate website. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy-related laws and regulations, including with respect to the information we collect from users of our games, it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming industry is often unclear. These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner, that is not consistent with our current data protection\npractices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Additionally, a violation of applicable data privacy or data security laws by third parties we work with might also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if we fail to adequately protect our users\u2019 privacy and data, it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the area of information security and data protection, many states and foreign jurisdictions have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. Costs to comply with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. The security measures we have in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees, customers and partners could be breached due to cyber-attacks initiated by third party hackers, employee error or malfeasance, fraudulent inducement of our employees to disclose sensitive information or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nChanges in foreign exchange rates and limitations on the convertibility of foreign currencies could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe currently transact business in more than 100 countries and in dozens of different currencies, with the Canadian Dollar and Indian Rupee being the primary international currencies in which we transact business. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. Dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We experienced significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the past and expect to experience continued significant fluctuations in the future. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency, and an increasing percentage of our international revenue is from customers who pay us in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and those other currencies could result in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of these expenses being higher and/or the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the foreign-denominated revenue being lower than would be the case if exchange rates were stable. This could negatively impact our operating results. To date, we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities, and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nWe face added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks as a result of our international operations and distribution, any of which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nInternational sales represented approximately 21.4%, 22.1%, and 23.5% of our revenue during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. To target international markets, we develop games that are customized for consumers in those markets. We have international offices located in Canada and India. We expect to increase our international presence, as we intend to increase the number of our employees in our Hyderabad, India office. Risks affecting our international operations include:\n\u25cfour ability to develop games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;\n\u25cfdifficulties developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u25cfmultiple and conflicting laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in these laws and regulations;\n\u25cfour ability to develop, customize and localize games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;\n\u25cfcompetition from local game developers that have significant market share in certain foreign markets and a better understanding of local consumer preferences;\n\u25cfpotential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments to government officials or representatives of commercial partners;\n\u25cfregulations that could potentially affect the content of our products and their distribution, such as in China where multiple governmental bodies must review and approve of any gaming application before it may be published;\n\u25cfforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside the United States;\n\u25cfpotential adverse foreign tax consequences, since due to our international operations, we must pay income tax in numerous foreign jurisdictions with complex and evolving tax laws;\n\u25cfpolitical, economic and social instability in some regions of the world;\n\u25cfhealth epidemics or contagious diseases, such as the novel coronavirus, that negatively impact our customers or supply chain;\n\u25cfrestrictions on the export or import of technology;\n\u25cftrade and tariff restrictions and variations in tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers; and\n\u25cfdifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights in certain countries.\nThese risks could harm our international operations, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We may also liquidate or cease operating some of our foreign subsidiaries in the future which may raise additional risks, including related to taxes and obtaining governmental approvals.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual property and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur intellectual property is essential to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. To date, we have only seventeen issued U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications currently outstanding, including two that we inherited through acquisitions, so we will not be able to protect the majority of our technologies from independent invention by third parties. In addition, we have filed foreign patent applications on two of the issued U.S. patents.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology and games, and some parties have distributed \u201cjail broken\u201d versions of our games where all of the content has been unlocked and made available for free. Further, some of our competitors have released games that are nearly identical to successful games released by their competitors in an effort to confuse the market and divert users from the competitor\u2019s game to the copycat game. To the extent third parties copy our games, it could reduce the amount of revenue we are able to generate from any infringed games. Monitoring unauthorized use of our games is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent piracy and other unauthorized distribution and\nuse of our technology and games, particularly in certain international jurisdictions, such as China, where the laws may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States. We may institute litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in December 2020 we filed a complaint against Reworks alleging that their game, Redecor - Home Design Makeover, infringes at least one claim of one of our patents. This litigation, and any similar litigation in the future, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nIn addition, although we require our third-party developers to sign agreements not to disclose or improperly use our trade secrets, to acknowledge that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property and to assign to us any ownership they may have in those works, it may still be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual properties without our consent. This could harm our brand, business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are, and in the future may become, involved in intellectual property disputes, which may disrupt our business, require us to pay significant damage awards and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nThird parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement, or initiate proceedings to invalidate our intellectual property, which, if successful, could disrupt our business, cause us to pay significant damage awards or require us to pay licensing fees. For example, in July 2018, SwiftLife, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against us, our wholly owned subsidiary Glu Games Inc., and Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc. and TAS Rights Management, LLC. The complaint alleged eight causes of action, including that Glu and the other defendants infringe the plaintiff\u2019s federally registered trademark, SwiftLife. While we were able to successfully resolve this matter without paying any amounts to the plaintiff, the outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, potential negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, any claims brought against us in the future could result in our being enjoined from using our intellectual property or licensed intellectual property, and we might incur significant licensing fees and could be forced to develop alternative technologies. We may also be required to pay penalties, judgments, royalties or significant settlement costs. If we fail or are unable to develop non-infringing technology or games or to license the infringed or similar technology or games on a timely basis, we may be forced to withdraw games from the market or be prevented from introducing new games. We might also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party claims, regardless of their merit.\nIn addition, we use open source software in some of our games and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our games, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nOur stock price has fluctuated and may continue to do so. Our stock price may be affected by third party data regarding our games.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future, as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as changes in the operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, such as Activision, Electronic Arts, and Zynga. We also experience stock price volatility as security analysts and investors base their views and monitor the performance of our games on third party data, like App Annie, AppData, Apptopia, comScore, or SensorTower. Third parties publish daily data about us and other mobile gaming companies with respect to downloads of our games, daily and monthly active users and estimated revenue generated by our games. These metrics can be volatile, particularly for specific games, and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of usage of our games across all platforms or the revenue generated by our games.\nIn addition, The Nasdaq Global Select Market on which our common stock is listed has in the past and more recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many companies, some of which appear to be unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could and did adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Securities class action litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative or misinformed reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline and/or become more volatile.\nThe trading market for our common stock is affected by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or lower their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. In addition, our share price and the volatility of our shares can be affected by misinformed or mistaken research reports on our business.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute existing stockholders\u2019 voting power and ownership interest in us.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors and their affiliates, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders, under our current shelf registration statements, through a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. For example, Tencent is free to sell the 21,000,000 shares it acquired from us in the second quarter of 2015 on the open-market, subject only to our black-out periods and other limitations under our insider trading policy. On June 2, 2020, we filed with the SEC, a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which became automatically effective upon filing. Under this shelf registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell common stock, such as our recent public offering of 17,250,000 shares of our common stock sold at $9.25 per share.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, may deter third parties from seeking to acquire us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including the following:\n\u25cfour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u25cfonly our chairman of the board, our lead independent director, our Chief Executive Officer, our president or a majority of our board of directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cfour stockholders are able to take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u25cfonly our board of directors and not our stockholders is able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cfour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u25cfadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before a meeting of stockholders.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15% or greater stockholder, although our board of directors waived this provision with respect to Tencent\u2019s potential acquisition of greater than 15% of our shares in connection with the transaction in which we initially sold shares of our common stock to an affiliate of Tencent.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not have any plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnanticipated changes in our income tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities may affect our future financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Determining our worldwide provision for income taxes requires significant judgments. The estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain, and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Recent and contemplated changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on a taxpayer\u2019s ability to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and defer certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Further, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and unfavorably impact our financial position and results of operations. Foreign tax authorities may also interpret or change tax regulations such that we may be subject to tax liabilities upon closure or liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine if our provision for income taxes is adequate. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may unfavorably impact our future financial results.\nWe must charge, collect and/or pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, gross receipts, value-added, sales and use, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. If tax authorities assert that we have taxable nexus in a jurisdiction, they may seek to impose past as well as future tax liability and/or penalties. Any such impositions could also cause significant administrative burdens and decrease our future sales. Moreover, state and federal legislatures have been considering various initiatives that could change our tax position regarding sales and use taxes.\nFinally, if we change our international operations, adopt new products and new distribution models, implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws, our tax expense could increase.\nOur facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could damage our facilities and equipment, which could require us to curtail or cease operations.\nOur principal offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area known for earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fires, explosions, floods, communications\nfailures, terrorist attacks and similar events. If any natural or other disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.", "PERMNO": 91900, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "GLUU"}
