RISK FACTORS.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we face various market, operational, strategic, and financial risks. These risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of operating a global business and, in particular, one focused on growth and cost-competitiveness. Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. However, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this report, as well as other risks currently unknown or deemed immaterial at the date of this report, could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results.\nA.\nMARKET RISKS\nCustomer and Supplier Matters\nOur OEM business, which currently accounts for approximately 81 percent of our net sales, is dependent upon the health of the customers and markets we serve.\nWe are highly susceptible to unfavorable trends in the markets we serve as our customers\u2019 sales and production levels are affected by general economic conditions, including access to credit, the price of fuel and electricity, employment levels and trends, interest rates, labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements and other market factors, as well as by customer-specific issues. Any significant decline in production levels for current and future customers could result in asset impairment charges and a reduction in our sales, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur OEM customers continually seek price reductions from us. These price reductions adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face continuous price-reduction pressure from our OEM customers. Virtually all OEMs impose aggressive price-reduction initiatives upon their suppliers, and we expect such actions to continue in the future. In response, we must reduce our operating costs in order to maintain profitability. We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to reduce our operating costs to offset customer price reductions; however, price reductions adversely affect our profit margins and are expected to do so in the future. If we are unable to avoid price reductions for our customers, or if we are unable to offset price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and manufacturing processes, sourcing alternatives, technology enhancements and other cost reduction initiatives, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTable of Content\nIf we were to lose business with a major OEM customer, our net sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nDeterioration of a business relationship with a major OEM customer could cause our sales and profitability to suffer. We principally compete for new business both during the initial development of new models and upon the redesign of existing models by our major customers. New model development generally begins two to five years prior to marketing such models to the public. The failure to obtain new business on new models or to retain or increase business on redesigned existing models could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, as a result of the relatively long lead times required for many of our complex components, it may be difficult in the short-term for us to obtain new sales to replace any unexpected decline in the sales of existing products. We may incur significant expense in preparing to meet anticipated customer requirements that may not be recovered. The loss of a major OEM customer, the loss of business with respect to one or more of the vehicle models that use our products, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components or materials from our suppliers.\nIn an effort to manage and reduce our cost of purchased goods and services, we, like many suppliers and customers, have been consolidating our supply base. As a result, we are dependent upon limited sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities, financial condition and ability to meet our demand. In some cases, it can take several months or longer to find a supplier due to qualification requirements. However, strong demand, capacity limitations, financial instability, or other problems experienced by our suppliers could result in shortages or delays in their supply of product to us. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components or materials from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components or materials from other sources, we would be unable to meet our production schedules and miss product delivery dates, which would adversely affect our sales, results of operations and customer relationships.\nFluctuations in costs of materials (including aluminum, steel, copper, nickel, other raw materials and energy) could place significant pressure on our results of operations.\nIncreases in the costs of materials could have a significant effect on our results of operations and on those of others in our industry. We have sought to alleviate this risk by including material pass-through provisions in our customer contracts when possible. Under these arrangements, we can pass certain material cost increases and decreases to our customers. However, where these pass-through arrangements are utilized, there can often be a three-month to one-year lag between the time of the material increase or decrease and the time of the pass-through. To further mitigate our exposure, we have, from time to time, entered into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted aluminum and copper purchases. However, these hedges may only partially offset increases in material costs, and significant increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe continual pressure to absorb costs adversely affects our profitability.\nOEM customers often request that we pay for design, engineering and tooling costs that are incurred prior to the start of production and recover these costs through amortization in the piece price of the product. Some of these costs cannot be capitalized, which adversely affects our profitability until the programs for which they have been incurred are launched. If a given program is not launched, or is launched with significantly lower volumes than planned, we may not be able to recover the design, engineering and tooling costs from our customers, further adversely affecting our profitability.\nCompetitive Environment\nWe face strong competition.\nThe competitive environment continues to be dynamic as our traditional OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates, lower costs associated with legal compliance, and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. In addition, consolidation and vertical integration within the supply base have introduced new or restructured competitors to our markets. Increased competition could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nTable of Content\nExposure to Foreign Currencies\nAs a global company, we are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may affect our financial results.\nAlthough our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in foreign currencies, including the euro, British pound, Brazilian real and others. Our sales and profitability are affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we generate sales and incur expenses. To the extent that we are unable to match sales in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported sales and earnings from our international operations will be lower because the applicable local currency will be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. In certain instances, currency rate fluctuations may create pricing pressure relative to competitors quoting in different currencies, which could result in our products becoming less competitive. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound or Brazilian real, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nB.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nChallenges of Maintaining a Competitive Cost Structure\nWe may be unable to maintain competitive cost structures within our business.\nAs part of the \u201cStrengthen\u201d objective of our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow transformational strategy, we are transitioning to a more global, product-based organization. We have engaged in restructuring activities in our Americas and Europe segments in efforts to optimize our manufacturing footprint and cost structure. These restructuring activities include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe, as well as targeted headcount reductions that will support our objective of reducing operational and SG&A cost structures. In addition, we are focused on reducing costs for materials and services through targeted adjustments and negotiations with our supply base. Our successful execution of these initiatives is critical to enable us to establish a cost environment that will increase and sustain our long-term competitiveness.\nChallenges of Product Launches\nWe are in the midst of launching a significant number of new programs at our facilities across the world. The success of these launches is critical to our business.\nWe design technologically advanced products, and the processes required to produce these products can be difficult and complex. We commit significant time and financial resources to ensure the successful launch of new products and programs. Due to our high level of launch activity in each of our segments, we must appropriately manage these launches, and deploy our operational and administrative resources to take advantage of this increase in our business. If we do not successfully launch the products and programs, we may lose market share or damage relationships with our customers, which could negatively affect our business. In addition, any failure in our manufacturing strategy for these new products or programs could result in production inefficiencies or asset impairment charges.\nComplexities of Global Presence\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nWe have manufacturing and technical facilities located in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. In fiscal 2016, 54 percent of our sales were from non-U.S. operations. Consequently, our global operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including changes in monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, incompatible business practices, and international terrorism. In addition, compliance with multiple and often conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive.\nTable of Content\nReliance upon Technology Advantage\nIf we cannot differentiate ourselves from our competitors with our technology, our existing and potential customers may seek lower prices and our sales and earnings may be adversely affected.\nPrice, quality, delivery, technological innovation, and application engineering development are the primary elements of competition in our markets. If we fail to keep pace with technological changes and cannot differentiate ourselves from our competitors with our technology or to provide high quality products and services, we may experience price erosion, lower sales, and lower margins. Significant technological developments by others also could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDevelopments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nWe own significant intellectual property, including a large number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. As we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite our efforts to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nInformation Technology Systems\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or breach of, our information technology systems.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for a prolonged time period, or a material breach of our information security, could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders, and/or the release of otherwise confidential information, adversely affecting our customer service and relationships as well as our reputation. We recognize the volume of cyber attacks is increasing; therefore, we employ commercially practical efforts to avoid such attacks, regardless of source, and provide reasonable assurance that we can appropriately mitigate an attack, should it occur. Each year, we evaluate our threat profile and our countermeasures in a continuing effort to maintain the integrity of our systems and data. In addition, our systems might be damaged or interrupted by other natural or man-made events (caused by us, by our service providers or others). Such delays, problems or costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nClaims and Litigation\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty and product liability claims and litigation or other legal proceedings.\nIn the event our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty and product liability claims and may be required to participate in a recall or other field campaign of such products. Many of our OEM customers have extended warranty protection for their vehicles, putting pressure on the supply base to extend warranty coverage as well. If our customers demand higher warranty-related cost recoveries, or if our products fail to perform as expected, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are also involved in various legal proceedings from time to time incidental to our business. If any such proceeding has a negative result, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTable of Content\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Regulations\nWe could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks in these areas and there can be no assurance we will avoid material costs or liabilities relating to such matters. Our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property may extend to previously owned or used property, properties owned by unrelated companies, as well as properties we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or other requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nC.\nSTRATEGIC RISK\nGrowth Strategies\nInability to identify and execute on inorganic- and organic-growth opportunities may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nAs part of the \u201cGrow\u201d objective of our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow transformational strategy, we expect to aggressively pursue acquisitions in \u201cindustrial\u201d markets and expand our market share in high-growth engine and powertrain cooling areas through focused research and development activities and commercial pursuits. There can be no assurance we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets and/or organic growth opportunities. If we are unable to successfully complete such transactions in the future, our growth may be limited. In addition, recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance, and administrative functions. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions and operate these businesses profitably, we may not achieve the financial or operational success expected from the acquisitions.\nD.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nLiquidity and Access to Cash\nMarket trends and regulatory requirements may require additional funding for our pension plans.\nWe have several defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our domestic employees hired on or before December 31, 2003. Our funding policy for these plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, the amount necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Our domestic plans have an unfunded balance of $90 million. During fiscal 2017, we anticipate making funding contributions totaling approximately $8 million related to these domestic plans. Funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, mortality rate tables, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes. Should changes in actuarial assumptions or other factors result in the requirement of significant additional funding contributions, our liquidity position could be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe may be subject to additional income tax expense or exposure due to negative or unexpected tax consequences.\nUnfavorable changes in the financial outlook of our operations in certain jurisdictions could lead to adverse changes in our valuation allowance assertions for our deferred tax assets. Additionally, the subjectivity of or changes in tax laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we have significant operations could materially affect our results of operations. We are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. Unfavorable or unexpected outcomes from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nTable of Content", "PERMNO": 54704, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "MOD"}
