{"cik": "1650445", "company": "Quorum Health Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nOur company faces a variety of risks. Many of these risks are beyond our control and could cause our actual operating results and financial performance to be materially different from our expectations. Some of these risks are described below, including risks related to our business, the Chapter 11 Cases, the effect of the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the Spin-off, the U.S. healthcare industry, laws and regulations governing our industry, the securities markets and ownership of our common stock. Other risk factors, such as those related to our markets, operations, liquidity and interest rates, are described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors or those contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our shareholders could lose all or part of their investment. Furthermore, our actual operating and financial results may differ materially from those predicted in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures, including those summarized in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Chapter 11 Proceedings\nOur voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and our ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, leaner company are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nIn 2019, we engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure needs, including strategic and refinancing alternatives to restructure our indebtedness in private transactions. These restructuring efforts led to the execution of the RSA and commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court on April 7, 2020.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and profitability of our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, our providers, business partners, and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nOther significant risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases, including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession;\n\u2022\ndelays in the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to confirm and consummate the Plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nthe effects of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and the interest of various constituents, including our stockholders, business partners, vendors, physicians, medical staff and employees;\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related advisory costs to affect our reorganization;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, business partners, patients, physicians, medical staff and employees and other third parties as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate debtor-in-possession financing;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with Bankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022\nthe length of time that we will operate with Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a U.S. trustee or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (\u201cChapter 7\u201d); and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with our ability to consummate the Plan.\nDue to the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases, the ultimate impact that the events that occur during these proceedings will have on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows cannot be predicted at this time.\nOperating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. For example, we must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with our vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022\nbuy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ngrant liens; and\n\u2022\nfinance our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nDelays in the Chapter 11 Cases may increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThe RSA contemplates the consummation of the Plan through an orderly pre-packaged plan of reorganization, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate the Plan. A prolonged Chapter 11 proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with our business partners, suppliers, patients, physicians, medical staff and employees, among other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and our ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, a weakening of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could adversely affect our ability to implement the Plan (or any other plan of reorganization). If we are unable to consummate the Plan, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.\nWe may not be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan or may have to modify the terms of the Plan.\nEven if the Plan is approved by each class of holders of claims and interests entitled to vote (a \u201cVoting Class\u201d), the Bankruptcy Court, which, as a court of equity, may exercise substantial discretion and may choose not to confirm the Plan. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129 requires, among other things, a showing that confirmation of the Plan will not be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization for us, and that the value of distributions to dissenting holders of claims and interests will not be less than the value such holders would receive if we, the debtors, liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Although we believe that the Plan will satisfy such tests, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.\nConfirmation of the Plan will also be subject to certain conditions. These conditions may not be met and there can be no assurance that the Consenting Stakeholders will agree to modify or waive such conditions. Further, changed circumstances may necessitate changes to the Plan. Any such modifications could result in less favorable treatment than the treatment currently anticipated being included in the Plan based upon the agreed terms of the RSA. Such less favorable treatment could include a distribution of property (including the new common stock) to the class affected by the modification of a lesser value than currently anticipated to be included in the Plan or no distribution of property whatsoever under the Plan. Changes to the Plan may also delay the confirmation of the Plan and our emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in, among other things, incurred costs and expenses to the Debtors.\nOur ability to emerge from Chapter 11 and operate as a going concern thereafter will depend on our ability to obtain suitable exit financing and reduce our debt and debt service costs.\nThe Plan provides that the Debtors will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases with a new senior secured asset-based credit facility that replaces the existing ABL Facility (the \u201cExit ABL Facility\u201d). The Debtors do not have a commitment from either the current lenders under the ABL Facility or a third party to provide the Exit ABL Facility. There is no guarantee that the Debtors will be able to secure such a commitment and, thus, the Debtors may seek to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases without an Exit ABL Facility or with\nan Exit ABL Facility on unfavorable terms. Either situation would negatively impact our ability to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases and continue to operate as a going concern.\nAdditionally, our current capital structure includes a high level of indebtedness. Our Plan contemplates restructuring, renegotiating, or otherwise discharging a substantial portion of our debt. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully achieve sufficient reductions in our debt and debt service costs and other cost savings or otherwise meet our planned continuing obligations. Failure to achieve substantial interest cost reduction and other cost savings upon emergence from bankruptcy could materially hamper our ability to operate profitably after our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, and could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nTermination of our exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances could result in competing plans of reorganization, which could have less favorable terms or result in significant litigation and expenses.\nWe currently have the exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan through August 5, 2020, and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances of any such plan through October 4, 2020. Such deadlines may be extended from time to time \u201cfor cause\u201d (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. However, it is also possible that (a) parties in interest could seek to shorten or terminate such exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods \u201cfor cause\u201d (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) or (b) that such periods could expire without extension.\nAlthough we expect to resolve the Chapter 11 Cases quickly, if our exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods expire or are terminated, other parties in interest will be permitted to file alternative plans of reorganization. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate us continuing as a going concern, us being liquidated, us or our assets being acquired by a third party, us being merged with a competitor, or some other proposal. There can be no assurances that recoveries under any such alternative plan would be as favorable to creditors as the Plan. In addition, the proposal of competing plans of reorganization may entail significant litigation and significantly increase the expenses of administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, which could deplete creditor recoveries under any plan.\nIf the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe RSA contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of which certain parties to the RSA may terminate the agreement. If the RSA is terminated as to all parties thereto, each of the parties will be released from its obligations in accordance with the terms of the RSA. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the RSA, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any new Plan would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Company and its subsidiaries as contemplated by the RSA.\nThe restructuring of the Company has required and will continue to require a substantial amount of time and attention of our senior management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe restructuring of the Company has required and will continue to require a substantial portion of time and attention from our senior management team and will leave them with less time to devote to the operations of our business. Throughout the months of January, February and March of 2020, our management has spent considerable time participating in the development of recapitalization and financial reorganization plans, the business plan for the Company, the RSA and related reorganization activities. This diversion of management\u2019s attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases is protracted.\nWe may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may not be comparable nor be indicative of our future financial performance.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our results of operations\nand financial condition following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the results of operations and financial condition reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to the filing of our Chapter 11 Cases (i) will be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) will be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. However, there can be no assurance that the aggregate amount of such claims that are not subject to treatment under the plan of reorganization or that are not discharged will not be material.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, raise additional capital, finance operations and capital expenditures, pursue desirable business opportunities or successfully operate our business in the future.\nPrior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court, we were a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, was $1.3 billion.\nOur overall leverage, terms of our financing arrangements and debt service obligations could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital and capital expenditures, to fund growth or to fund general corporate purposes, even when necessary for us to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies were revised downward;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to make interest payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our operating cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities, financial obligations and other general corporate expenditures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industry in which we operate, and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and governmental regulations.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in patient preferences, the success of responding to changing payment models, the success in transitioning our IT TSA from CHS and regulatory issues and pressure from competitors.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including our credit facilities and the indenture governing our Senior Notes, contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nAs of April 7, 2020, we were in default under the credit agreements governing our ABL Credit Facility and Senior Credit Facility and under the indenture governing our Senior Notes due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court. Further, other covenant defaults have occurred and are continuing under the credit agreements governing our ABL Credit Facility and Senior Credit Facility and under the indenture governing our Senior Notes, including as a result of cross-defaults between the credit agreements and the indenture. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nOther agreements that we enter into governing our debt, including in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, have or will contain covenants that impose restrictions on us. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt. In connection with the Spin-off, on April 29, 2016, we entered into two credit agreements, the Senior Credit Facility and the ABL Credit Facility, that subject us to variable interest rates tied to LIBOR or a base rate. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding principal amount of debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, of $835.3 million subject to variable rates of interest, which included $97.0\nmillion of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2019. If the interest rate on our variable rate long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, after taking into consideration the 1% floor on our Term Loan Facility, was 100 basis points higher for the year ended December 31, 2019, the additional interest expense impacting net income (loss) would have been $8.5 million.\nOther indebtedness that we incur, including in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, has or will contain variable interest rates. Subject to a Bankruptcy Court order approving the DIP Facility, the lenders under the DIP Facility will make available to us loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million, and such loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the adjusted LIBOR used for the Senior Credit Facility, plus 10.00%. Furthermore, the Plan provides that we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases with exit financing arrangements, and depending on the final terms, such exit financing arrangements may expose us to variable rate interest risk.\nOur financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. In an effort to achieve liquidity that would be sufficient to meet all of our commitments, we have undertaken a number of actions, including divesting underperforming hospitals, negotiating with our creditors and stakeholders, and reducing recurring expenses. However, we believe that even after taking these actions, we will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of our future financial obligations, comply with our debt covenants, and execute our business plan. As a result, we filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 7, 2020. The risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, the events of default under our credit agreements and the indenture governing our Senior Notes, and the other conditions impacting our business raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our cash flows could also be negatively impacted, particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant amount of time.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) is a global pandemic that is significantly affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are likely to be materially adversely affected, particularly if the pandemic persists for a significant amount of time.\nFrom an operational perspective, we are focused on providing the safest possible environment for our employees, physicians and other caregivers, and for the care of our patients, while safeguarding patient information. We are working with federal, state and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases in the communities we serve and are taking or supporting measures to try to limit the spread of the virus and to mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. Although we are implementing considerable safety measures, as a front line provider of healthcare services, we are deeply exposed to the health and economic effects of COVID-19, many of which will have a material adverse impact on our employees, as well as our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows that we are not currently able to fully quantify. For example, in 2020, we had to furlough certain employees due to the lack of volume at our hospitals, and these furloughs may persist for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are reassigning hospital personnel with pre-existing conditions or restrictions that make them especially vulnerable to COVID-19 where possible, while some are self-quarantining and not available to work at our facilities during this time. We have also instituted a work-from-home policy for certain of our corporate and administrative offices. Even with such steps, exposure to COVID-19 patients has increased risks to doctors and nurses, which may further reduce our operating capacity. All of these actions could result in reduced employee morale, labor unrest, work stoppages or other workforce disruptions.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of elective surgeries, physician office visits and emergency room volumes at our facilities due to restrictive measures, like quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and general concerns related to the risk of contracting COVID-19 from interacting with the healthcare system. We believe that certain of these patient volume declines reflect a deferral of healthcare services utilization to a later period, rather than a permanent reduction in demand for our services. Given the general necessity of the healthcare services we provide, we anticipate that this deferral of services may create a backlog of demand in the future, in addition to the resumption of historically normal activity; however, there is no assurance that either will occur. In addition, while the hospitals that we operate in a wide range of geographies have not experienced major capacity constraints to date, other hospitals in areas that are centers of the COVID-19 outbreak have been overwhelmed, experiencing excessive demand, potentially preventing them from treating all patients who seek care. Despite considerable efforts to source vital supplies, we are also experiencing supply chain disruptions, including shortages, delays and significant price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment (\u201cPPE\u201d). Staffing, equipment, and pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may also impact our ability to admit and treat patients.\nWe may also require an increased level of working capital if we experience extended billing and collection cycles as a result of displaced employees, payors, revenue cycle management contractors, or otherwise. Broad economic factors resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including increasing unemployment rates and reduced consumer spending, also affect our service mix, revenue mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and layoffs in the areas we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, requiring an increased level of working capital. If general economic conditions continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by federal or state laws, regulations, orders, or other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S. healthcare system, which, if adopted, could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We may also be subject to lawsuits from patients, employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities. Such actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs, though there is no certainty at this time whether any such lawsuits will be filed or the outcome of such lawsuits if filed. Our professional and general liability insurance may not cover all claims against us.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could heighten the risks in certain of the other risk factors described herein.\nThe CARES Act is recent legislation in which there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding its implementation. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for assistance under the CARES Act, or if we do qualify, there is no certainty as to the amount of assistance we will receive.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted. The CARES Act is an approximate $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package passed in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The CARES Act includes broad sweeping provisions including direct financial assistance to Americans in the form of one-time payments to individuals; aid to small businesses in the form of loans and grants; efforts to stabilize the U.S. economy and keep Americans employed in general; and support for healthcare professionals, patients and hospitals. We may have access to potential additional sources of liquidity through funding that may be available to healthcare providers under the CARES Act. The CARES Act includes provisions providing flexibility and financial resources to healthcare providers during this public health emergency. The CARES Act provides funding to support public entities, Medicare or Medicaid enrolled suppliers and providers, and for-profit and not-for-profit entities specified by HHS that provide diagnoses, testing, or care for COVID-19 patients. The funding, to be included in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund that is administered by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, is intended to reimburse providers for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. The CARES Act also provides funding to support rural critical access hospitals. Also included in the CARES Act are numerous income tax provisions including changes to the Net Operating Loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) rules and the business interest expense deduction rules under Code Section 163(j). Factors that could affect our ability to receive funding include our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the finalization of regulations under the CARES Act, among other factors. Due to the recent enactment of this legislation, there is a high degree of uncertainty around its implementation and we continue to assess the potential impacts of this legislation on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will receive funding under the CARES Act.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on global markets could affect our future access to liquidity and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe coronavirus has spread throughout much of the world after initially surfacing in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our business is unknown. State and local authorities in the United States, like their counterparts in many other countries, have since forced many businesses to temporarily shut down in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus, and Americans are being told by public officials to practice \u201csocial distancing.\u201d Global stock markets have reacted very negatively, and economists are projecting a sharp economic slowdown, at least in the near term, even if governments take emergency relief measures. While the economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 is difficult to assess or predict, the COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital in the future, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. The situation is constantly evolving, however, so the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact businesses and the economy is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be affected.\nA future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the markets in which we operate hospitals, or which otherwise impacts our healthcare facilities, could adversely impact our business.\nIf a future pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to affect any or all of the markets in which we operate hospitals, in addition to or following the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public\u2019s trust in\nhealthcare facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose or that are treating or have treated patients affected by contagious diseases. If any of our healthcare facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care from our healthcare facilities. Further, a future pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our healthcare facilities. Moreover, we cannot predict the costs associated with the potential treatment of a future infectious disease outbreak by our hospitals or preparation for such treatment. A future pandemic could also adversely impact our business in ways that are difficult to predict. Although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, the potential impact of a future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, with respect to our markets or our healthcare facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business. In addition, if such events lead to a significant or prolonged impact on capital or credit markets or economic growth, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs or commercial insurance and other managed care payors are reduced, if we are unable to maintain favorable contract terms with payors or comply with our payor contract obligations, if insured individuals move to insurance programs or plans with greater coverage exclusions or narrower networks, or if insurance coverage is otherwise restricted, our net operating revenues may decline.\nOur net patient revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, were 49.2%, 47.0% and 49.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were 39.9%, 40.2% and 38.1% from managed care and commercial payors for these respective periods. Healthcare expenditures continue to increase and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls. Driven by these financial factors and ongoing health reform efforts, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including changes in payment methodologies, reductions in reimbursement payment levels and reductions to payments made to providers under state supplemental payment programs. Some of these changes have already decreased, and could further decrease in the future, the amount of payments we receive for our services.\nIn addition, governmental and commercial payors, as well as other third parties from whom we receive payment for our services, attempt to control healthcare costs by, for example, requiring hospitals to discount payments for their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plan networks, restricting coverage through utilization reviews, reducing coverage of inpatient services and shifting coverage of care to outpatient settings when possible, requiring prior authorizations for non-emergency services and implementing alternative payment models. The ability of commercial payors to control healthcare costs using these measures may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of private health insurance companies and managed care companies and vertical integration of health insurers with healthcare providers. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure. Furthermore, our contracts with payors require us to comply with a number of terms related to the provision of services and billing for services. If we are unable to negotiate increased reimbursement rates, maintain existing reimbursement rates or other favorable contract terms, effectively respond to payor cost controls or comply with the terms of our payor contracts, the payments we receive for our services may be reduced or we may be involved in disputes with payors and experience payment denials, both prospectively and retroactively.\nIn recent years, the percentage of the population with health insurance has increased, driven primarily by various provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. However, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. In addition, the President signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain health plans, potentially allowing for fewer plans that adhere to specific Affordable Care Act coverage mandates. Further, individuals are increasingly enrolling in high-deductible health plans, which tend to have lower reimbursement rates for providers along with higher co-payments and deductibles due from the patient in comparison to traditional plans. These plans, sometimes referred to as consumer directed plans, may even exclude our hospitals and employed physicians from coverage.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of our reimbursements will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\nChanges to Medicaid supplemental payment programs may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nMedicaid state supplemental payments to providers are separate from and in addition to those made under a state\u2019s standard Medicaid program. For example, federal law requires state Medicaid programs to make DSH payments to hospitals that serve significant numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation provide for reductions in Medicaid DSH payments. Under the budget bill signed into law in February 2018, Medicaid DSH payments will be reduced by $4 billion in 2020 and by $8 billion per year from 2021 through 2025. On December 20, 2019, these cuts were delayed until May 22, 2020; however, the passing of the CARES Act further delayed these cuts through December 2020. The extension of the delay until December 2020 has an estimated impact of $1.1 million in additional Medicaid state supplemental payments for our hospitals. Future reductions in Medicaid DSH payments and the funding of similar programs could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results\nof operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of our Medicaid supplemental payment programs beyond the extension noted above will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\nSupplemental payment programs are being reviewed by certain state agencies, and some states have made or may make waiver requests to CMS to replace existing supplemental payment programs. These reviews and waiver requests may result in restructuring of such programs and could cause reductions in or elimination of the payments. In December 2017, CMS announced that it will phase out funding for Designated State Health Programs under Medicaid waivers granted pursuant to section 1115 of the Social Security Act. The Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program is an example of such a waiver. The program offsets some costs of providing uncompensated care and incentivizes delivery system reform under a waiver granted by CMS. In December 2017, CMS has approved an extension of the Texas Medicaid waiver through September 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out the federal funding related to delivery system reform, eliminating those federal payments beginning October 1, 2021. In addition, Texas will not receive any federal financial participation for uncompensated care pool payments until CMS approves revised uncompensated care protocol policies for the state.\nMany states currently fund significant portions of their Medicaid supplemental payment programs through intergovernmental transfers (\"IGTs\") and/or provider tax methodologies. In general, a \"provider tax,\u201d (also referred to as a \"fee\" or \"assessment\") is adopted by states to collect revenue from specified categories of providers. Such taxes must be implemented in accordance with a complex series of federal regulations. Taxes and IGTs (often a separate and distinct source of revenue) are used to generate new funds that can be matched with federal funds. These financing mechanisms often enable states to receive additional federal Medicaid dollars without increasing their overall state tax burden. In turn, the additional federally matched Medicaid dollars can be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to providers.\nOn November 12, 2019, CMS proposed the Medicaid Fiscal Accountability Rule (CMS-2393-P) (\"MFAR\"). CMS indicates that MFAR is aimed at strengthening the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program and helping to ensure that state supplemental payments and financing arrangements are transparent and value-driven. If finalized, the MFAR has the potential to require profound changes to Medicaid supplemental payment programs and the financing methodologies noted above. In general, the rule would limit states' ability to use IGTs to fund their Medicaid programs, and would require provider tax funding structures to be redesigned. Such changes would likely impact every state in which supplemental payment programs are funded through IGTs or provider tax methodologies.\nMore specifically, the MFAR would require IGTs to be derived solely from state or local tax revenues. This would significantly limit the use of IGTs as a source of state financing, and would likely reduce and cap the amount of funds available to governmental entities for purposes of funding Medicaid supplemental payments. The MFAR would further prohibit mitigation structures currently used by many providers to reduce financial risks associated with provider tax programs by prohibiting \"pooling\" arrangements. States would further be prohibited from taxing Medicaid utilization at a higher rate, even when other regulatory requirements are met, which would require many states to change the structure of their provider tax programs.\nThe MFAR would also require states to report provider-specific payment information on payments received for state plan services and through demonstration programs, as well as identify the specific authority for these payments, and the source of the non-federal share. The rule would mandate sun-setting of existing and new supplemental payment programs after no more than 3 years and require states to request a new CMS approval to continue a supplemental payment beyond a maximum 3 year approved period.\nThe timing of the proposed rule may also be problematic for many state governments. Many state legislatures do not convene until mid-January, near or at the end of CMS' comment period for the MFAR. This provides little time for states to assess the impact of the rule or address it through state budget changes, as the MFAR could be finalized during state legislative sessions, or after such sessions have concluded.\nThe full impact of the MFAR is difficult to assess, but if finalized, it would likely have a significant impact on Medicaid supplemental payment programs in the states in which we operate. Due to the limitations on financing mechanisms, and other restrictions that would be imposed on such supplemental payments, the MFAR could result in decreases in our Medicaid revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn December 2017, CMS approved Phase V of California\u2019s HQAF program, with a program period of January 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019. The HQAF program provides funding for supplemental payments to hospitals that serve Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. The supplemental payments are funded in part by the federal government. Phase V of California\u2019s HQAF program expired on June 30, 2019 and the next phase of the program, Phase VI, began July 1, 2019 and is expected to be a 30 month program. We cannot provide any assurances of the timing of CMS\u2019 approval of the next phase of the HQAF program or the timing of the related cash flows. In addition, changes to the Medi-Cal program may affect the availability of funding for supplemental payments.\nAs a result of the increase in reviews of claims filed for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, we may experience delayed payments or incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us under these programs.\nWe are subject to routine post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare and Medicaid for reimbursement for our healthcare services provided to covered patients. The number and parameters of claims subject to these post-payment reviews may increase as a result of federal and state governmental healthcare cost-containment initiatives, including enhanced medical necessity reviews for Medicare patients admitted as inpatients to hospitals for certain procedures. Furthermore,\nCMS contracts with Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201cRACs\u201d) to perform a post-payment targeted review process that employs data analysis techniques in order to identify Medicare and Medicaid claims most likely to contain overpayments, such as incorrectly coded services, short stay admissions, incorrect payment amounts, non-covered services and duplicate payments. The claims review strategies used by RACs generally include a review of high dollar claims, including inpatient hospital claims. As a result, a large majority of the total payment adjustments determined by RACs relate to hospital claims. In addition, CMS employs Medical Integrity Contractors {\u201cMICs\u201d) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims to identify potential overpayments. State Medicaid agencies and other private third-party contractors have also increased their review activities. Third-party audits or investigations of Medicare or Medicaid claims could result in increases or decreases in our revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when the related healthcare services were performed, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nPayment recoveries resulting from post-payment reviews and denials are appealable. However, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2019 was over three years. As a result of a federal court ruling in 2018, however, the processing time is being reduced as a federal judge ordered HHS to decrease the number of pending Medicare appeals according to a specific schedule by FY 2022. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nA material portion of our revenues are concentrated in a few states which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in that state.\nOur revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in the state of Illinois and Oregon where we generate a significant portion of our patient revenues. We currently operate eight hospitals in Illinois and one hospital in Oregon, which collectively accounted for 54.6%, 54.1% and 49.0% of our net patient revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes to Medicaid and other governmental payor programs in these states, including reductions in reimbursement rates or delays in timing of reimbursement payments, could also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are unable to predict the ultimate impact of healthcare reform initiatives, including changes to the Affordable Care Act, and our business may be adversely affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed entirely or if provisions benefitting our operations are significantly modified.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increased access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Affordable Care Act, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. As currently structured, the Affordable Care Act, expands health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms, reduces Medicare reimbursement to hospitals, and promotes value-based purchasing. There are currently several public and private initiatives that aim to transition payment models from passive volume-based reimbursement to models that are tied to the quality and value of services. We are limited in our ability to reduce the direct costs of providing care to patients. We are unable to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms, whether such reforms are implemented by government or other industry participants, such as private payors and large employer groups, or the potential impact of such changes to our operations.\nThe Trump administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation and/or its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. In addition, a presidential executive order has been signed that directs agencies to minimize \u201ceconomic and regulatory burdens\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. CMS administrators have indicated that they intend to grant states additional flexibility in the administration of state Medicaid programs, including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the Affordable Care Act will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of alternative provisions, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers as well as other healthcare industry participants. Further, Congress could eliminate or alter provisions beneficial to us while leaving in place provisions reducing our reimbursement. In addition, in December 2018, a federal judge in Texas issued a decision finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, Texas v. U.S., N.D. Tex., No. 4:18-cv-00167 (Dec. 14, 2017). This decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which ruled, in December 2019 in Texas v. U.S., 945 F.3d (5th Cir. 2019), that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded back to the Texas court to evaluate whether other provisions of the Affordable Care Act could survive without the individual mandate. A group of Democratic state officials and the Democratic-led House of Representatives have petitioned the Supreme Court to review the decision, and there continues to be uncertainty about the future of the law. Efforts to repeal or change the Affordable Care Act or implement other initiatives intended to reform healthcare delivery and financial systems may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nFurther, several new start-up companies have entered the growing healthcare technology sector, which is expected to grow to approximately $280 billion by 2021, according to MarketsandMarkets Private Research Ltd. This emerging sector aims to fundamentally change how healthcare is financed and delivered and has started to work with large employers and private payors to implement reforms to private health insurance. Larger technology companies, such as Amazon and Alphabet's Google unit, also have demonstrated interest in this sector through the establishment of joint ventures with emerging companies. At this time, we are unable to predict the nature and success of these private initiatives, but they may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or capital resources.\nIf we experience growth in self-pay revenues, or if we experience deterioration in the collectability of patient responsibility accounts, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe primary uncertainty in collectability of our revenues relates to uninsured patients and the patient financial responsibility portion of payments due from insured patients. Collections on self-pay account balances are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay, the effectiveness of R1 RCM\u2019s collection efforts, the effectiveness of our third-party collection agencies and our own collection efforts. Significant changes in payor mix, centralized business office operations, in-market or overall U.S. economic conditions, or new and changing laws and regulations related to federal and state governmental healthcare coverage, among other things, could adversely impact our estimates of accounts receivable collectability.\nMoreover, we may be adversely affected by growth in the patient financial responsibility portion of payments for services or other conditions or restrictions associated with governmental and non-governmental healthcare plans and programs. Individuals are increasingly using healthcare savings accounts and participating in more narrow or tiered network programs. Our ability to improve collections of our patient accounts (as well as the ability of those collecting patient accounts on our behalf) may be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at hospital charges and collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. In addition, a deterioration of economic conditions in the United States could lead to higher levels of uninsured patients, result in higher levels of patients covered by lower-paying governmental programs, result in fiscal uncertainties related to both governmental and non-governmental payors and could limit the economic ability of patients to make payments for which they are responsible. If we experience growth in self-pay revenues volume or deterioration in collectability of patient accounts, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, we have experienced increasing numbers of individuals covered by Medicaid or commercial insurance plans primarily due to the insurance expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act. However, efforts to repeal or revise the Affordable Care Act have caused uncertainty with regard to the future of this statute and its effects on the size of the uninsured population of U.S. citizens. In 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. There is also uncertainty regarding the number and identity of states that will ultimately expand their Medicaid programs, and on what terms. These factors, among others, make it difficult to predict changes to the percentage of our revenues comprised of self-pay revenues.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete for patients, local residents in the markets where we operate hospitals may choose to use other hospitals and healthcare providers for medical treatment.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients and physician affiliations. We are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services in 19 of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital is located, which means we typically have less direct competition for our hospital services. Our hospitals face competition for patients from out-of-market hospitals, including hospitals in urban areas that may have more comprehensive specialty care service lines, more advanced medical equipment and technology, more extensive medical research capabilities and greater access to medical education programs. Patients who receive medical treatment from an out-of-market hospital may subsequently shift their preferences to that hospital for future healthcare services. We also face competition from other specialty care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that are not affiliated with us. Our hospitals and many of the hospitals with which we compete engage in physician alignment strategies, which may include employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, participating in ACOs and, to the extent permitted by law, physician ownership of healthcare facilities.\nWe face competition from municipal and not-for-profit hospitals. In our markets where we are not the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, our primary competitor is generally a not-for-profit hospital. Not-for-profit hospitals are typically owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities which are financially supported by endowments and charitable contributions. Not-for-profit hospitals do not pay income or property taxes and can make capital investments without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and to offer more specialized services than those available at our hospitals. If our competitors are better able to attract patients with these offerings, we may experience an overall decline in our patient volumes and operating revenues. Recent consolidations of not-for-profit hospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure.\nOur ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice related to both physicians and hospitals by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider. For example, plans with narrow network structures restrict the number of participating in-network provider plans, and tiered network structures impose higher cost-sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. If we are unable to\nparticipate in plan networks or favorable tiers or are otherwise unable to retain or maintain favorable contracts with health plans, our patient volumes may decrease and our revenues may be reduced. In addition, healthcare industry participants are increasingly pursuing alignment initiatives, such as the acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health. Integration among insurers and providers and cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may shift costs, accelerate further change, and impact our ability to compete in ways that are difficult to predict.\nTrends toward increasing clinical transparency and value-based purchasing may have an adverse impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. The CMS Hospital Compare website makes available to the public certain data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. In addition, hospitals are required to publish their standard charges for healthcare items and services or their policy for allowing the public to review a list of their standard charges for healthcare services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on quality of care measures or patient satisfaction surveys, if our results are lower than the results of our competitors, or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients.\nWe expect these competitive trends to continue. If we are unable to compete effectively with other healthcare providers, local residents may seek healthcare services from providers other than our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities.\nA significant decline in operating results or other indicators of impairment at one or more of our facilities, including outpatient ancillary affiliated entities, could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings to impair the value of long-lived assets.\nOur operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, including property, equipment, software and other long-lived intangible assets. If one of our hospitals or other healthcare facilities experiences declining operating results or is adversely impacted by one or more of the risk factors related to our business, we may not be able to recover the carrying value of those assets through our future operating cash flows. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether changes in future undiscounted cash flows reflect any potential impairment in the fair value of our long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded impairment of $42.8 million, $77.1 million and $45.4 million because of declining operating results and projections of future cash flows at certain of our hospitals. See Note 2 - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill in the accompanying financial statements.\nIf the fair value of one or both of our reporting units declines, it could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill.\nThe testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions related to our cost of capital and other factors impacting our fair value models. Future estimates of fair value could be adversely affected if the actual outcome of one or more of these assumptions changes materially in the future, including lower than expected hospital patient volumes, reduced reimbursement or increased operating costs. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired when events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017 we recorded $6.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of impairment to goodwill related to certain hospitals we intended for divestiture. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIf we fail to improve the financial and operating performance of our existing hospitals, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy.\nSome of our existing hospitals are experiencing lower operating margins than other hospitals in our portfolio and we may occasionally experience delays in improving the operating margins of our existing hospitals. In the future, if we are unable to improve the operating margins of these existing hospitals or operate them profitably we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy. To the extent that our operating margins were to decline as a result of financial and operating performance at our hospitals, we could be unable to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreements or be limited or precluded from obtaining future borrowings by the terms of our credit agreements and the indenture governing our Senior Notes.\nThe failure or downsizing of large employers, or the closure of manufacturing or other major facilities in our markets, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.\nThe economies in the markets in which most of our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers, especially manufacturing or other major facilities. These employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and outpatient service facilities for their medical care. The failure of one or more large employers, or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at manufacturing or other facilities located in or near the markets in which we operate hospitals, could cause affected residents to move elsewhere for employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events may cause a reduction in our revenues and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational, legal and financial risks associated with outsourcing functions to third parties.\nWe have outsourced to CHS, through various transition services agreements, certain services including, among others, services related to information technology, payroll processing and other human resources functions. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of any parties in which we delegate services; however, the transition services agreements with CHS were executed in connection with the Spin-off, based upon certain business and financial assumptions. To the extent that any of the transition services agreements are determined not to benefit us in their current form, our ability to renegotiate, rescind or reform any or all of the agreements may be limited or non-existent, and our business could be adversely affected.\nOn May 8, 2019, we entered into an agreement with R1 RCM to receive end-to-end revenue cycle management services. The agreement with R1 RCM has, among other things, allowed for us to transition our billing and collection services from CHS to R1 RCM. In July 2019, R1 RCM began providing limited services to us, such as status review on aged accounts receivable and insurance denials. Effective October 1, 2019, we transitioned our billing and collection services from CHS to R1 RCM. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be affected by the ability of R1 RCM, as provider of our revenue cycle management services, to timely and appropriately bill and collect.\nArrangements with third-party service providers may make our operations vulnerable if these vendors fail to satisfy their obligations to us as a result of their performance, changes in their own operations, financial condition or other matters outside of our control. We may also face legal, financial or reputational harm for the actions or omissions of such providers, and we may not have effective recourse against the providers. Effective management, development and implementation of our outsourcing strategies are important to our business strategy. If there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes or our third-party service providers do not perform, we may not be able to fully realize on a timely basis the economic and other benefits of the outsourcing services or other relationships we enter into with key vendors, which could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning arrangements with key vendors, including the transition services agreements with CHS, could result in additional costs and a risk of operational problems, delays in collections from payors, potential errors and possible control issues during the termination and transition processes, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA material disruption of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have entered into a Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement with CHS, pursuant to which CHS provides information technology infrastructure, support and maintenance services. The term of the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement is scheduled to expire in April 2021. We are currently engaged in discussions with CHS regarding an extension of the term of the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement past April 2021 to meet our information technology planning needs. We expect that these discussions will result in a mutually agreeable extension. However, in the event that the term of the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement is not extended, our costs may increase as a result of having to procure information technology services from third parties. In addition, we may not be able to replace these services in a timely manner or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement. A material disruption of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe failure to obtain our medical supplies and drugs at favorable prices could cause our operating results to be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into a participation agreement with a group purchasing organization (\u201cGPO\u201d). GPOs attempt to obtain favorable pricing on medical supplies and drugs with manufacturers and vendors, sometimes by negotiating exclusive supply arrangements in exchange for discounts. To the extent these exclusive supply arrangements are challenged or deemed unenforceable, we could incur higher costs than anticipated for our medical supplies obtained through the GPO. Also, there can be no assurance that our arrangement with the GPO will provide the expected discounts on a long-term basis. Furthermore, costs of medical supplies and drugs may continue to increase due to market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product and drug releases. Higher costs could cause our operating results to be adversely affected.\nOur inability to recruit and retain quality physicians could adversely impact our performance.\nAlthough we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the healthcare facilities at which they practice. The success of our healthcare facilities depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities, our ability to employ or contract with quality physicians, the admitting and utilization practices of employed and non-employee physicians, maintaining good relations with physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. In many of the markets we serve, many physicians have admitting privileges at other healthcare facilities in addition to our healthcare facilities. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation or employment with our healthcare facilities at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate supporting medical staff or technologically advanced medical equipment and facilities that meet the needs or expectations of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.\nOur labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for medical staff, a shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.\nIn addition to our physicians, the operations of our healthcare facilities are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our hospital management teams and other medical staff, such as nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists and lab technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and medical staff responsible for the daily operations of our healthcare facilities. In some markets across the United States, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue for healthcare providers. We may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract medical staff. In addition, some states have, and others could adopt, mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues at hospitals where admissions must be limited in order to meet the required ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,500 employees, including approximately 500 part-time employees, at our five hospitals represented by labor unions. Increased or ongoing labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs or otherwise adversely impact us. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our labor costs could increase significantly. In addition, when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operations during any strike periods could increase our labor costs and otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise the payment rates for our healthcare services to offset these increased costs. A significant portion of our revenues are subject to fixed reimbursement rates, which constrains our ability to pass along the impact of these increased costs to the patient or other third-party payors. In the event we are not effective at recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical staff, or we are unable to control our labor costs in relation to certain events and circumstances, the increase in our labor costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSignificant fluctuations and volatility in cost, such as labor, medical supply and drug costs, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe healthcare industry is labor intensive. Salaries, benefits and other labor-related costs increase during periods of inflation and periods of labor shortages for nurses and other medical staff, which may differ depending on the geographic area in which a hospital is located. In addition, the Affordable Care Act is subject to ongoing revisions and possible repeal and replacement, which may lead to substantially higher costs to us related to providing employee medical benefits. We are also exposed to rising costs for medical supplies and drugs due to inflationary and other pricing pressures on our suppliers, including our group purchasing organization. We have implemented cost control measures to monitor and manage the impact of rising operating costs and expenses on our operating margins, including, among others, the reduction of costs in non-labor intensive categories. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to adequately offset the impact that any future increases in labor costs, employee medical benefit costs or other operating costs and expenses may have on our business which could adversely impact our operating margins in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our costs will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\nOur hospitals and other healthcare facilities may be negatively impacted by severe weather, earthquakes, power outages and other factors beyond our control, which could restrict patient access to care or cause one or more of our facilities to close temporarily.\nThe results of operations of our hospitals and outpatient service facilities may be adversely impacted by severe weather conditions, including hurricanes and widespread winter storms or earthquakes, power outages or other factors beyond our control that could cause disruption to patient scheduling or displacement of our patients, employees, physicians and clinical staff, and may force certain of our facilities to close temporarily. In certain geographic areas, we have a concentration of hospitals and outpatient service facilities that may be simultaneously affected by adverse weather conditions or other events. These types of disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf our adoption and utilization of electronic health record systems fails to satisfy CMS standards, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the HITECH Act, MACRA and other laws, HHS has established Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs to encourage hospitals and healthcare professionals to adopt EHR technology. Eligible hospitals can receive Medicaid incentive payments for their adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology; Medicare incentive payments are no longer available because under MACRA the Medicare EHR incentive program was transitioned to become one of the four components of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (\u201cMIPS\u201d) under the Quality Payment Program (\u201cQPP\u201d). Under the QPP, eligible healthcare professionals are also subject to positive or negative payment adjustments based, in part, on their use of EHR technology. If our hospitals and healthcare professionals are unable to properly adopt, maintain, and utilize certified EHR technology, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments under the Medicaid EHR incentive program (also known as the \u201cPromoting Interoperability Program\u201d), and we could be subject to negative payment adjustments under the QPP that may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf there are delays in regulatory updates by governmental agencies to federal and state healthcare programs, we may experience increased volatility in our operating results as such delays may result in a timing difference between when such program revenues are earned and when they become known or estimable for purposes of accounting recognition.\nOur net patient revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, were 49.2%, 47.0% and 49.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The reimbursement payments related to these programs are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that can have a significant impact on our operating results. When delays occur in the passage of legislation, funding authorizations or the implementation of regulations, we could experience material increases or decreases in our revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when the related healthcare services were performed. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded net favorable (unfavorable) contractual allowance adjustments in net operating revenues of $2.2 million, $(0.3) million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to previous program reimbursement estimates and final cost report settlements. The volatility in the timing of recognition of adjustments to reimbursement payments under these programs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nControls designed by third-party payors to reduce utilization of inpatient services may reduce our revenues.\nOver the last several years, third-party payors, including both governmental and non-governmental payors, have instituted policies and procedures to substantially reduce or limit coverage of inpatient healthcare services. Payors have implemented controls and procedures designed to monitor and reduce patient admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as \u201cutilization review,\u201d which have impacted and are expected to continue to impact inpatient admission volumes at our hospitals. Federal laws contain numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and hospital occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization requirements, payor-required post-admission utilization reviews and payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative delivery options for healthcare services for less acutely ill patients. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates by governmental and non-governmental third-party payors could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive laws and governmental regulations that apply to the U.S. healthcare industry, including anti-fraud and abuse laws, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is governed by extensive laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations include standards that address, among other issues, the following:\n\u2022\nthe adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, and operating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nbilling and coding for services;\n\u2022\nproper handling of overpayments;\n\u2022\nclassification of levels of care provided;\n\u2022\npreparing and filing of cost reports;\n\u2022\nrelationships with referral sources and referral recipients;\n\u2022\ncorporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of adequate records;\n\u2022\ncompliance with building codes;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection;\n\u2022\nprivacy and security; and\n\u2022\ndebt collection and communications with patients and consumers.\nExamples of these laws include, but are not limited to, HIPAA, the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, EMTALA and similar state laws. These laws are applicable to financial arrangements we have with physicians and other health care providers who refer patients to our hospitals, employed physicians and other health care services. The laws are quite complex and subject to varying interpretations.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully offer to pay, solicit or receive any remuneration to induce referrals for services covered by a federal health care program, or to induce a person to arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of a service or item covered by a federal health care program. Because of the broad scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the OIG has enacted a number of safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. While we strive to comply with applicable safe harbors wherever possible, the safe harbors are narrowly tailored and certain arrangements, including joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians and referrals sources, are not able to fit squarely within a safe harbor. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor, however, does not necessarily mean that that the Anti-\nKickback Statute is violated or that an arrangement is illegal. Instead, the arrangement is measured against the statutory prohibition, which precludes, among other things, payments to induce, or in return, for referrals. Nevertheless, absent compliance with a safe harbor, we cannot guarantee that an arrangement would not be found to implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nIn addition, our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark law. Under the Stark Law, a broad prohibition is created and, unless the parties qualify for an exception, the referral and submission of claims for services provided pursuant to the referral is prohibited. While we attempt to structure all financial relationships with physicians and physician organizations to comply with an exception to the Stark law, the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and subject to varying interpretations. Therefore, we cannot provide a guarantee that every financial relationship with a physician complies fully with the Stark law. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark law is not an intent-based stated and, therefore, even an inadvertent or technical non-compliance may lead to a violation.\nOne category of arrangements subject to the Stark law is physician-owned hospitals. We have three hospitals with physician ownership and, therefore, we must meet all requirements of the applicable exception to the Stark law known as the \u201cwhole hospital\" exception. The exception generally permits a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, rather than holding an ownership interest in a department of the hospital, if all requirements of the exception are met. Changes were made to the Stark law as part of the Affordable Care Act that narrowed the applicability of the \u201cwhole hospital\u201d exception to the Stark Law for new and existing physician-owned hospitals. As a result, the Stark law provided a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of existing physician ownership in hospitals if certain requirements continued to be met and the physicians did not increase the aggregate percentage of ownership in the hospitals. The physician-owned hospitals are subject to a prohibition of expansion of the facility capacity beyond the aggregate number of operating rooms, procedure rooms and beds for which the hospital was licensed as of March 23, 2010. The whole hospital exception also contains additional disclosure requirements that the hospital and physician owners must make to patients related to their ownership interests. If a physician-owned hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could be required to repay Medicare payments related to tainted referrals and could possibly lose its Medicare provider agreement. Tracking the required elements of the \u201cwhole hospital exception\u201d is critical to maintaining these entities in compliance with the Stark law.\nThe Civil False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) generally prohibits the knowing filing of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States or the knowing use of a false record or statement to obtain payment from the United States or a conspiracy to defraud the United States by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid. If we violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to be in violation of the FCA. Under the FCA a suit can be brought by the government, or by a private person under a qui tam, or \"whistleblower\" action on behalf of the government.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil sanctions and criminal penalties, including the loss of our operating licenses and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. There are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state governmental agencies relating to the U.S. healthcare industry. Recent enforcement actions have focused on financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians, billing for services without adequately documenting medical necessity and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such services. Specific to our hospitals, we have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental agencies regarding these and other matters, and we are also subject to various claims and lawsuits relating to such matters. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for a further discussion of these matters.\nIn the future, evolving interpretations or enforcement of the laws and regulations applicable to the U.S. healthcare industry could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes to our healthcare facilities, equipment, personnel, healthcare service offerings, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.\nWe may be adversely affected by consolidation among health insurers and other industry participants.\nIn recent years, a number of private health insurers have merged or increased efforts to consolidate with other non-governmental payors. Insurers are also increasingly pursuing alignment initiatives with healthcare providers. Consolidation within the health insurance industry may result in insurers having increased negotiating leverage and competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing data. In addition, the trend within the U.S. healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing programs could be accelerated if the large private health insurance companies, including those engaging in consolidation activity, find these programs to be financially beneficial. Other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, may intensify competitive pressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict. We cannot predict whether we will be able to negotiate favorable terms and otherwise respond effectively to the impact of increased consolidation within the payor industry or vertical integration efforts.\nWe may from time to time become the subject of legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings that, if resolved unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and we may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown.\nWe may from time to time become a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters. Those proceedings include, among other things, governmental investigations. In addition, we may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences.\nAddressing any investigations, lawsuits or other claims may distract management and divert resources, even if we ultimately prevail. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of any such current or future legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other such loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGovernmental investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While CHS has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities relating to outcomes or events occurring prior to the closing of the Spin-off, we cannot guarantee that any such legal proceedings or loss contingencies will be covered by such indemnities or that CHS will fully indemnify us thereunder. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for additional information on legal proceedings to which we are subject.\nWe could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs as a result of significant legal actions.\nPhysicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice and other liability claims or legal theories. Even in states that have imposed caps on damage awards, plaintiffs are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant costs for legal defense. To protect us from the vulnerability to the potentially significant costs arising from these claims, we maintain claims-made professional and general liability insurance coverage in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured. We believe the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient to cover potential losses of our operations. Our insurance coverage, however, may not continue to be available in the future at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. Additionally, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us, such as fines, penalties, or other damage and legal expense payments resulting from qui tam lawsuits. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal actions against us or the effect that judgments or settlements in such matters may have on us or on our insurance costs. Additionally, all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. If the aggregate limit of any of our professional and general liability policies is exhausted, in whole or in part, it could deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period. Furthermore, one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill its or their obligations to defend, pay or reimburse us when those obligations become due. In that case, or if payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although CHS has agreed to indemnify us for certain legal proceedings and our loss contingencies relating to outcomes or events occurring prior to the closing of the Spin-off, we cannot guarantee that any such legal proceedings or loss contingencies will be covered by such indemnities or that CHS will fully indemnify us thereunder.\nOur operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.\nThe operation of our information systems is essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including (i) accounting and financial reporting; (ii) billing and collecting accounts; (iii) coding and compliance; (iv) clinical systems; and (v) medical records and document storage. In general, information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. In addition, our business is at risk from and may be impacted by information security incidents, including ransomware, malware, and other electronic security events. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. These events can also result from internal compromises, such as human error or malicious acts. These events can occur on our systems or on the systems of our partners and subcontractors.\nWe entered into various transition services agreements with CHS that define agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to us. The transition services agreements generally have terms of five years and include, among others, services related to information technology, payroll processing, and certain human resources functions. The majority of our information systems are managed by CHS under the terms of these agreements. We believe that CHS and our other subcontractors and vendors take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our business operations as a result of failure or disruption to their information systems. However, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a disruption, and it is possible that we may be impacted by information system failures. The occurrence of any information system failures could result in interruptions, delays, loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems. All of these events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and they could harm our business reputation.\nA cyber-attack or security breach could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential patient data, confidential corporate information, or critical systems and give rise to potential harm to patients, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law or other legal theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems and those of our third-party vendors to collect, store and manage clinical and financial data on our networks and devices, to communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties, and to summarize and analyze our operating results. Our networks and devices store sensitive information, including intellectual property,\nproprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients, partners and employees. As a result, cyber-security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, process and practices designed to protect our information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Our ability to recover from a ransomware, phishing, social engineering, hacking or other cyber-attack is dependent on these practices, including successful backup systems and other recovery procedures. We have made significant investments in technology to protect our systems and information from cyber-security risks. In partnership with CHS, one of our more significant third-party vendors, we have implemented security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber event.\nIn particular, despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against our and our third-party vendor\u2019s information systems and devices create risks of cybersecurity incidents. These risks include ransomware, malware, and other electronic security events and the resulting damage. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. They can also result from internal compromises, such as human error or malicious acts. Breaches of personal information can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. There can be no assurance that we, or our third-party vendors including CHS, will not be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could impact the integrity, availability or privacy of protected patient medical data or other information subject to privacy laws, or they could disrupt our information technology systems, medical devices or business, including our ability to provide various healthcare services. Additionally, growing cyber-security threats related to the use of ransomware, phishing and other malicious software threaten the access to, availability of, and utilization of critical information technology and data.\nAs cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. In addition, the healthcare industry is currently experiencing increased attention on compliance with regulations designed to safeguard protected health information and mitigate cyber-attacks on entities. There continues to be an increased level of attention focused on cyber-attacks on healthcare providers because of the vast amount of personally identifiable information these organizations possess. Most healthcare providers, including all who accept Medicare and Medicaid, must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, regulations regarding the privacy and security of protected health information. States also maintain laws focused in this area. The HIPAA regulations impose extensive administrative requirements with regard to how protected health information may be used and disclosed. Further, the regulations and similar state laws include extensive and complex provisions which require us to establish reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information maintained in electronic format. We must safeguard protected health information against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the information.\nWe are obligated under HIPAA and state law to notify individuals and the government if personal information is compromised as defined by the law. In addition, the Secretary of HHS is required to perform periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. Further, in addition to activities by federal regulators, state attorneys general are also engaged in enforcement activities with respect to information security breaches.\nViolations of these various privacy and security laws can result in significant civil monetary penalties, as well as the potential for criminal penalties. In addition to state data breach notification requirements, HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions on behalf of affected state residents against entities that violate HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security regulations. These penalties could be in addition to other penalties assessed by a state for a breach which would be considered reportable under the state\u2019s data breach notification laws. Further, there are significant costs associated with a breach, including investigation costs, remediation and mitigation costs, notification costs, attorney fees, and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to a loss in confidence in the provider. We cannot predict the costs to comply with these laws or the costs associated with a potential breach of protected health information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and our business reputation.\nIf we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could also result in harm to patients; business interruptions and delays; the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; reputational damage and federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe trend toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services is gaining momentum across the U.S. healthcare industry among both governmental and commercial payors. Generally, value-based purchasing initiatives tie reimbursement payments to the quality and efficiency of patient care. For example, hospitals that fall into the lowest-performing 25% of national risk-adjusted Hospital Acquired Conditions (\u201cHAC\u201d) rates for all hospitals in the previous year are subject to a 1% reduction in their total Medicare\nreimbursement payments. Further, hospitals do not receive Medicare reimbursement payments for care related to HACs. In addition, HHS reduces Medicare inpatient hospital reimbursement payments for all discharges by a required percentage, set at 2% for federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years, and pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards. Hospitals are also required to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nHHS has indicated that it is particularly focused on tying Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the quality and cost of care they deliver to patients. Examples of alternative payment models include ACOs and bundled payment arrangements. While participation in bundled payment programs is voluntary, CMS has indicated that it is developing more bundled payment models, although it is unclear whether they will successfully lead to increased coordination of care and cost containment. It is possible that the adoption of alternative payment models will decrease the aggregate reimbursements under federal and state healthcare programs.\nSeveral of the largest commercial insurance payors in the United States have also expressed the intent to increase reliance on value-based purchasing. Furthermore, many large commercial insurance payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.\nNotably, on October 9, 2019, both the OIG and CMS issued proposed rules that, if adopted, would create new exceptions to the Stark law and safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute for value-based arrangements that are intended to remove regulatory barriers under those laws to allow greater flexibility for care coordination and value-based models. While it is possible that these regulations, if adopted, could vary from the proposals, the proposals would be useful for protecting arrangements under both government and commercial payor value-based programs.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement rates on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement payment amounts under both governmental and non-governmental programs and plans. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues, operating costs, or both.\nCertificate of need laws and regulations regarding licenses, ownership and operation may impair our future expansion or divestiture opportunities in some states. In states without certificate of need laws, our providers may face lower barriers to entry, but could also face increased competition from other providers.\nSome states require prior approval for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities based on the state\u2019s determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. In addition, certain states in which we operate hospitals require a CON for, among other things, capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount and changes in bed capacity or healthcare service lines. We may not be able to obtain CONs required for expansion activities that we want to pursue in the future. In addition, we are required to maintain one or more licenses in all of the states in which we operate hospitals. If we fail to obtain a required CON or license, our ability to operate or expand our operations in those states could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if a CON or other prior approval upon which we relied to invest in construction of a replacement or expanded healthcare facility were to be revoked or lost through an appeal process, we may not be able to recover the value of our investment.\nSome states in which we operate do not require CONs for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services. Additionally, from time to time, states with existing requirements may repeal or limit the scope of their CON programs for future entry. In these cases, our competing healthcare providers could face lower barriers to entry and expansion into certain states where we operate hospitals. We could face decreased market share and revenues if competing healthcare providers are able to purchase, construct or expand healthcare facilities, without being subject to regulatory approval, into markets that are in close proximity to those in which we operate hospitals.\nQuorum Health Resources, while subject to various risk factors affecting its hospital industry clients, is subject to additional risks related to its unique business model.\nThe various risk factors stated herein that could result in adverse impacts on the results of operations of our hospitals could similarly affect the hospital and other healthcare clients of our QHR business. Any negative impact on our QHR clients could result in defaults under or terminations of one or more of our contracts, or could result in our inability to attract new management advisory and consulting business. Furthermore, QHR could be subject to allegations of mismanagement, as well as assertions of participation in incidents of alleged malpractice in its position as a management advisor to certain hospital clients. It is possible that resolutions of these actions could require settlements from us that exceed the revenues received from the related hospital client, and this could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretations, or becoming subject to additional federal, state or local taxes, could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state taxes such as income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount of our cash flow, and have a material\nadverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority which could increase our tax liabilities. If we are required to pay additional taxes, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off and Our Operations as an Independent Publicly Traded Company\nThe utilization of our federal income tax loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward of approximately $267.6 million on a pre-tax basis available to offset future taxable income and have recorded a full valuation allowance on these federal NOL carryforwards. Any NOL arising in a taxable year ending before January 1, 2018 may only be carried forward for 20 taxable years following the taxable year of such loss. We have $166.1 million of NOLs that were created before January 1, 2018. Any NOL arising in a taxable year ending on or after January 1, 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, any NOL deduction with respect to an NOL arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited to 80% of our taxable income, computed without regard to the NOL deduction, in the year in which the deduction is taken. We have $101.5 million of NOLs with an indefinite carryforward.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d) also imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a company\u2019s taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company\u2019s \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code, collectively increase their ownership in a company by more than 50 percentage points, by value, over a rolling three-year period. This is different from a change in beneficial ownership under applicable securities laws. These ownership changes include purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs, a company\u2019s offering of its stock, the purchase or sale of company stock by 5-percent shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire company stock. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use the NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL carryforwards that may not be realized.\nThe enactment of the CARES Act in March 2020 provides that NOLs arising in a tax year beginning in 2018, 2019 or 2020 can be carried back five years and temporarily removes the 80% taxable income limitation to allow an NOL to fully offset income. Due to the recent enactment of this legislation, we continue to assess the potential impacts of this legislation on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe utilization of our state income tax loss carryforwards could be limited if we do not realize profits from our hospital operations to adequately offset these losses in the applicable states where they exist.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had state income tax loss carryforwards of approximately $754 million. We expect to be able to realize a small amount of our NOL carryforwards in certain states. In other states where we hope to improve our financial performance we cannot make assurances that we will be able to fully realize the tax benefit associated with these state NOL carryforwards. As a result, we have recorded a valuation allowance to offset all or a portion of the deferred tax asset created by the NOL carryforwards in those states. We could be required to record additional valuation allowance related to our state NOL carryforwards based upon our operating results in the future, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe utilization of our interest expense carryforward as calculated under the Tax Act could be limited in the future.\nWe have generated an estimated $193.8 million of disallowed interest expense as calculated under the new interest expense limitation provisions defined in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. This disallowed amount creates a deferred tax asset that can be carried forward indefinitely. However, due to our significant amount of third party debt, we may not be able to deduct this carryforward in future tax years until we reduce our third party debt, generate significant amounts of income, or there is a change in the tax law.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe Spin-off could be challenged under various state fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the Spin-off left CHS insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that CHS intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that CHS did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-off. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff that the Spin-off was a fraudulent transfer, then such court could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, avoidance of the transfer, an attachment or other provisional remedy against the asset transferred, an injunction against further disposition by the debtor or a transferee, or both, of the asset transferred, or any other relief the circumstances may require.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the\namount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that CHS was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement with CHS, from and after the Spin-off, we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to our business. Although we do not expect to be liable for any of these or other obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by CHS should CHS fail to pay or perform its retained obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is no longer traded on a national securities exchange and is quoted only in the over-the-counter market.\nIn connection with the announcement of our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the NYSE suspended the trading of our shares of common stock on April 7, 2020 and determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE. Our common stock has commenced trading on OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol \u201cQHCCQ.\u201d However, the extent of the public market for our common stock and the continued availability of quotations would depend upon such factors as the aggregate market value of the common stock, the interest in maintaining a market in our common stock on the part of securities firms and other factors. The over-the-counter market is a significantly more limited market than the NYSE, and the quotation of our common stock in the over-the-counter market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our common stock.\nTrading in our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.\nAll of our indebtedness is senior to the existing common stock in our capital structure. The RSA and the Plan contemplate that our existing equity interests will be cancelled and discharged in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the holders of those equity interests, including the holders of our common stock, will be entitled to no recovery. Accordingly, any trading in our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, among other things, authorize our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit our shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders and provide that Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of legal proceedings initiated by our shareholders. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we are required not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition of our common stock, issuance of our common stock or any other transaction or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction, that could cause the distribution of our common stock to CHS shareholders to be taxable. We also agreed to indemnify CHS for any tax resulting from any such transactions. Generally, CHS will recognize taxable gain on the distribution of our common stock if there are one or more acquisitions or issuances of our common stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of our then-outstanding common stock, and the acquisition or issuance is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution of common stock to CHS shareholders. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the Spin-off date, with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances, will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. As a result, our obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nWe may terminate our Exchange Act reporting, if permitted by applicable law.\nIf at any time our common stock is delisted and held by fewer than 300 holders of record, we will be permitted to cease to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act to the extent we are not otherwise required to continue to report pursuant to Section 15(d)\nof the Exchange Act or any contractual agreements, including with respect to any of our indebtedness. If we were to cease filing reports under the Exchange Act, the information now available to our stockholders in the annual, quarterly and other reports we currently file with the SEC would not be available to them as a matter of right. As of April 2, 2020, there were 158 holders of record of our shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16004, "SIC": 8062, "TIC": "QHCCQ"}
