Such risks and uncertainties also could cause our future financial condition and future financial performance to differ significantly from our current expectations, which are described in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Those risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, include the following:\nA decline in the popularity of collectibles and a resulting decrease in submissions for our services could adversely impact our business.\nThe volume of collectibles submitted to us for authentication and grading is affected by the demand for and market value of those collectibles and the popularity of certain coins released by the United States Mint. As the demand for and value of collectibles increase, authentication and grading submissions, as well as requests by submitters for higher priced faster turnaround times, can also increase. However, that also means that a decline in the popularity or, in the value of the collectibles that we authenticate, and grade would cause decreases in authentication and grading submissions to us and in the requests, we receive for faster turnaround times resulting in declines in our revenues and profitability. We have found, over the years, as evidenced by the reduction in our U.S. coin grading fees in certain periods of fiscal years 2012 to 2013, 2015 to 2016, and fiscal 2018, that the popularity of collectibles for certain specific coin programs, can vary due to a number of factors, most of which are outside of our control, including perceived scarcity of collectibles, changes in consumer confidence and trends and their impact on disposable income, precious metals prices, interest rates and other general economic conditions. See \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Factors that can Affect our Operating Results and Financial Position\u201d below in the Report.\nWe are dependent on our coins and trading cards and autographs authentication and grading services for most of our revenues which makes us vulnerable to changes in economic or market conditions that could adversely affect the demand for those services and our operating results.\nCoin authentication and grading and other coin-related services accounted for approximately 57%, 63% and 68% of total net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our U.S. and overseas modern coin authentication and grading revenues represented approximately 15%, 21% and 27% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe that the principal factors that can lead to fluctuations in U.S. coin grading submissions include:(i) economic downturns which can result in a decline in consumer and business confidence and disposable income and, therefore, the willingness of dealers and collectors to buy collectible coins, (ii) the performance of the stock and bond markets, the level of interest rates and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and in the value of precious metals, which can lead investors to shift some of their investments between stocks and bonds, on the one hand, and precious metals, on the other; (iii) in the case of modern coin submissions, increases or reductions in the marketing activities or the popularity of programs that are conducted by the U.S. Mint or dealers or customers, who specialize in selling modern coins (iv) the pricing of our services particularly for our modern coin programs and (v) short-term changes in the value of gold, particularly around the time of collectibles trade shows. In addition, our cards and autographs revenues accounted for approximately 36%, 31% and 25% of our total net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018, 2017 respectively. While we are less dependent on coin revenues due to the increase in cards and autographs revenues, this continuing lack of diversity in our sources of revenues and our dependence on submissions from our two main businesses for a majority of our net revenues make us more vulnerable to changes in market conditions, which could result in reductions in our total net revenues and gross margin and, therefore, hurt our operating results, as evidenced by the reduction in both our revenues and operating income in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017, due mainly to the lower U.S. coin revenues in fiscal 2018.\nMoreover, if another economic downturn, such as the one from 2008 to 2012, were to occur, our dependence on coin authentication and grading services for our revenues could increase, because the prices that dealers and collectors can realize on sales of trading cards generally are significantly lower than the prices they are able to realize on sales of collectible coins, making it more difficult, for trading card collectors to afford or justify incurring the costs of obtaining independent authentication and grading services. In addition, our coin business is expanding into overseas markets, which could increase our reliance on the coin market over the longer term.\nIncreases in turnaround times experienced by customers at our trading cards and autographs business may dampen demand for our services and reduce the growth in our revenues.\nOur cards and autographs business which represents about 36% of total revenues in fiscal 2019, has experienced revenue growth rates of 25% and 17% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2019, that business had a record backlog of collectible submissions, awaiting authentication and grading by our experts. We continue to add authentication and grading capacity to meet the increased demand for our services, however, our backlog has continued to grow in fiscal 2019. Although to date, we have not experienced a slowdown in submissions from our customers, over time continued increased turnaround times may negatively impact the level of submissions and therefore reduce the growth of our service revenues.\nDeclines in general economic conditions could result in decreased demand for our services, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe availability of discretionary or disposable income and the confidence of collectors and dealers about future economic conditions are important factors that can affect their willingness and ability to purchase, and the prices that they are willing to pay for collectibles. Additionally, declines in the confidence and reductions in the cash flows of, and reductions in credit that is available to collectibles dealers, can adversely affect their ability to purchase high-value collectibles and willingness to sell collectibles that may have declined in value due to adverse changes in economic conditions of this nature. Declines in purchases and sales, or in the value of collectibles usually result, in turn, in declines in the use of authentication and grading services, as such services are often used in conjunction with and to facilitate collectibles sale and purchase transactions. As a result, economic uncertainties, downturns and recessions can and do adversely affect our operating results by (i) reducing the frequency with which collectibles dealers and collectors submit their coins, trading cards and other collectibles for authentication and grading including, in particular, modern coins and trading cards, primarily because authentication and grading fees are relatively high in relation to the value of those collectibles; and (ii) adversely affecting the ability of customers to pay outstanding accounts receivable on a timely basis.\nTemporary popularity of some collectibles may result in short-term increases, followed by decreases, in the volume of submissions for our services, which could cause our revenues to fluctuate.\nTemporary popularity or \u201cfads\u201d among collectors, or the popularity of certain modern coin marketing programs, either by the U.S. Mint or by dealers or distributors of collectibles, may lead to short-term or temporary increases, followed by decreases in the volume and in the average service fees that can be earned on collectibles that we authenticate and grade. This can be particularly common with modern coins released by the U.S. Mint or other special releases that are seasonal in nature. Trends of this nature may result in significant period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results and could result in declines in our net revenues and profitability, not only because of a resulting decline in the volume of authenticating and grading submissions, but also because such trends could lead to increased price competition, or pressure on the level of fees we are able to charge customers, and could require us to reduce our authentication and grading fees in order to maintain market share.\nOur top five customers account for approximately 11% of our total net revenues in fiscal 2019\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, five of our customers accounted, in the aggregate, for approximately 11% of our total net revenues. As a result, the loss of any of those customers, or the lack of success of marketing programs by those customers both in the U.S. or in China, or changes in our relationship with any of those customers could lead to a decrease in the volume of grading submissions which could cause our net revenues to decline and, therefore, could harm our operating results. See \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Factors that can Affect our Operating Results and Financial Position\u201d below in the Report.\nThere are risks associated with new or expanded service offerings and geographic expansion, with which we have limited experience.\nOn an ongoing basis, we seek to introduce new services that we can offer to our existing authentication and grading customers as a means of increasing our net revenues and profitability. In addition, in recent years we began offering and providing authentication and grading services in France, Hong Kong, Japan and mainland China. Those new services and our international operations, however, may not meet our expectations and may prove to be unprofitable which could lead to impairments of amounts capitalized and negatively impact our operating results. Furthermore, volatility in the level of services generated at our international operations, particularly in China, may add volatility to our quarterly and annual operating results.\nChanging market conditions in China have adversely affected the level of China revenues and the future growth of our coin business in China may be slower in the future.\nThe reduction in China revenues to $4.2 million in fiscal 2019, from $7.7 million in fiscal 2018, reflects the absence of any significant revenues from the banking channel. As previously reported, through February 2018, we had an exclusive relationship with a banking channel customer in China. Due to changing market conditions in China, and a desire to broaden our customer base, in February 2018, we notified the customer that we had decided to terminate the exclusive relationship but were prepared to continue to authenticate and grade coins on a non-exclusive basis. It is too early to predict the longer-term effect this action will have on future coin submissions from this customer or how successful we will be in attracting submissions from other coin customers in China. However, non-banking channel revenues increased by approximately 14% in fiscal 2019. See also \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Factors that can Affect our Operating Results and Financial Position\u201d below.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.\nWe have expanded our coin authentication and grading businesses into foreign markets including France, Hong Kong, Japan and mainland China. Those operations pose risks that might adversely affect, possibly materially, our future financial performance. Those risks include the following:\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, which could increase our costs of doing business internationally and could expose us to possible governmental or legal action in the foreign countries where we conduct business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in navigating the evolving exchange control regulations in mainland China that can cause delays in repatriating excess cash balances from China to the United States.\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ndifferences in and difficulties in enforcing intellectual property protections;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with operating a business in a potentially unstable political climate, such as (for example) the recent political instability and uncertainty in Hong Kong; and\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in identifying and responding to changes in market conditions in overseas markets;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects of trade disputes between the United States and foreign countries where we conduct business.\nWe invoice our overseas customers for our coin authentication and grading services in the local foreign currency in the country in which the business operates, except in the case of Hong Kong, where we invoice our customers in U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2019, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies on our financial results was not significant. There can, however, be no assurance that there will not be changes in foreign exchange rates that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future.\nWe are dependent on our key management personnel.\nOur performance is greatly dependent on the performance of our senior management and certain other key employees. As a result, the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key management employees could harm our business. Some of our executive officers and key employees are experts in the collectibles markets and have industry-wide reputations for authentication and grading of collectibles. The loss of any of those officers or other key employees, could have a negative effect on our reputation for expertise in the collectibles markets that we serve and could lead to a reduction in authentication and grading submissions to us and thereby result in decreases in revenues and profitability.\nWe are dependent on our collectibles experts.\nIn each of our markets, there are a limited number of individuals who have the expertise to authenticate and grade collectibles, and competition for available collectibles experts is intense. Accordingly, our business and our growth initiatives are heavily dependent on our ability (i) to retain our existing collectibles experts, who have developed relatively unique skills and enjoy a reputation for being experts within the collectibles markets, and (ii) to implement personnel programs to enable us to add collectibles experts, as necessary, to grow our business, both in the United States and overseas and to offset employee turnover that can occur from time to time. Moreover, some of our experts could leave and in the past have left our Company to join competitors or start competing businesses. If we are not successful in retaining our existing collectibles experts or in hiring and training new collectibles experts, this could limit our ability to grow our business and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have developed a reputation as one of the leading third party providers of collectibles authentication and grading services, as well as related services, as a result of a number of factors including, we believe, the rigorousness and consistency of our grading standards and the integrity of our grading processes, which enables us to provide warranty protection to our customers, our knowledge of the collectibles markets in which we operate, and innovative programs and services that we have developed and are able to offer to our customers, including the Collectors Club, our Set Registry Programs and our Certified Coin Exchange dealer-to-dealer Internet bid-ask market. As a result, our continued success is heavily dependent on our maintaining that reputation among collectibles dealers and collectors. Failures or errors in authentication or grading processes, such as inconsistent application of grading standards or incidents that put the integrity of those processes into question, could significantly impair our reputation in the marketplace which, in turn, could lead to a loss of customer confidence and a decrease in the demand for our services and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could suffer losses on authentication and grading warranties.\nIn general, we issue an authenticity or grading warranty for coins and trading cards that we authenticate or grade. Those warranties provide that:\n\u25a0\nif a coin or trading card that we authenticated and sealed in one of our tamper-evident plastic holders are later determined by us not to have been genuine, we would have to purchase the collectible at its current market value had it been genuine; or\n\u25a0\nif a coin or trading card that we graded and sealed in one of our tamper-evident plastic holders later receives a lower grade upon resubmission to us for grading, we would be obligated either to purchase the collectible at the market value at its original assigned grade or to pay the difference between that value as compared to the value at the lower grade.\nWe have no insurance coverage for claims made under these warranties. We monitor the adequacy of our warranty reserves on an ongoing basis and maintain reserves for warranty claims based on historical experience. However, there is no assurance that these warranty reserves will prove to be adequate, and as we expand our services in overseas markets, we may incur higher warranty claims than we have experienced in the past. If our warranty reserves prove to be inadequate, our gross margin and operating results could be harmed.\nIncreased competition could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAlthough there are few major competitors in the collectibles authentication and grading markets in which we currently operate, competition in these markets is, nevertheless, intense. Increased competition in our collectibles markets could adversely affect our pricing and profit margins and our ability to achieve further growth, and we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to be successful in competing against existing or future competitors in our collectibles markets. Also, if we were to enter into new collectibles markets, it is likely we would face intense competition from existing competitors in those markets who are likely to have greater brand name recognition and long-term relationships with collectibles dealers and individual collectors in those markets than we will have. Such competition could adversely affect our ability to generate profits and could cause us to incur losses or impairment charges in those markets and damage our financial condition.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends at current levels or at all.\nAs previously reported, the continued payment of cash dividends is subject to a number of factors, including changes in market and financial conditions and the cash requirements of our business. On February 4, 2018 the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the amount of quarterly cash dividends to $0.175 per share from $0.35 per share. Although, we consider the new dividend policy to be at a more sustainable level, there is no assurance that the amount of the current quarterly cash dividend will not be further reduced or the payment of cash dividends will not be suspended or discontinued altogether by the Board of Directors. See \u201cMARKET FOR COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \u201d\u2500Dividends in Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report. Any further reduction in the amount of, or any suspension or discontinuation of, our quarterly cash dividend is likely to adversely affect our stock price.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers for principally all of our \u201ctamper-evident,\u201d clear plastic coin and trading card holders exposes us to potential supply and quality problems.\nWe place all of the coins and trading cards that we authenticate and grade, in tamper-evident, clear plastic holders and related gaskets. In addition, we incorporate security features into the holders to mitigate the risk of counterfeits. In order to take advantage of volume-pricing discounts, we purchase substantially all of those holders, from a limited number of suppliers. For our highest volume most critical plastic parts, we now have back-up suppliers and dies used in the manufacture of those parts. Some of our back-up suppliers for these plastic holders are not U.S. based suppliers. In addition, when developing new holders, we concentrate the purchase of holders through a single supplier, at least initially. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial portion of those plastic holders could expose us to the potential for delays in our ability to deliver timely authentication and grading services in the event that a supplier was to terminate its services to us or encounter financial or production problems. If, in such an event, we were unable to obtain replacement holders from a back-up supplier in a relatively short period of time, we could lose customer orders, or incur additional production costs, or both. To mitigate this risk, the Company (i) owns the dies used to manufacture the parts, (ii) has increased its inventory of holders, to give us more time to arrange for production from other suppliers in the event of a termination of or interruption in service from our existing suppliers. If holders obtained from alternative suppliers are not of consistent quality, we could be exposed to additional warranty claims because tampering with those holders may not be as readily detectible. In addition, using overseas suppliers for holders may expose us to a higher risk of counterfeit holders that could damage our reputation. These factors could cause a decline in our net revenues and increases in our costs of sales which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, we continuously review the security features of our holders to ensure we can increase our chances of detecting tampering with our holders.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and tax laws, in general, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing the rate and how the U.S. imposes income tax on U.S. and multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law which could impact our tax obligations in the period issued.\nIn addition, tax laws can require complex computations, the application of which, can be uncertain. Furthermore, a rollback of the reduced rates in the Tax Act, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate, in the future.\nOur computer systems and network systems may be vulnerable to system failure due to a lack of redundant systems at other locations.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer systems against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, fires, earthquakes and similar catastrophic events. In this regard, Southern California, where we are located and our computer systems are housed, is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and fires that could result in damage to our computer systems that could cause interruptions of our services. Additionally, we could encounter disruptions that would harm our business as a result of problems on the internet or actions of internet users that could make it difficult for our customers to access our websites. Difficulties encountered during planned system upgrades or re-implementations also could lead to disruptions of our services.\nWhile we have standby redundancy for most of our computer systems in the cloud, not all systems are being replicated in real time. As a result, if any such events, disruptions or other of these problems were to occur, we could become unable to access information that is critically important to our ability to continue our operations which could cause interruptions in the delivery of our services and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive and store confidential personally identifiable information provided to us by our customers, such as passwords and credit card information.\nAn increasing number of large internet companies and traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d businesses have disclosed security breaches of their websites and computer systems that have led to the interruptions of service and, in certain cases, the misappropriation or theft of confidential personally identifiable information of their customers (often referred to as \u201cidentity theft\u201d). Because the techniques used by the perpetrators of such security breaches change frequently and may be difficult to detect, like those companies and businesses, we may be unable to anticipate the techniques used in such breaches or to implement adequate preventative measures. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical causes such as, for example, actions of employees or third party service providers. Our servers also are vulnerable to computer viruses or malware and physical or electronic break-ins that could prevent our customers from accessing our online services. In addition, hardware that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security or disrupt our operations. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide for secure storage and transmissions of confidential information, including customer passwords and payment card numbers. However, as the recent disclosures by large internet companies and traditional businesses demonstrate, such technology may not be sufficient to enable us to detect or prevent security breaches or the misappropriation or theft of personally identifiable customer information, which could damage our reputation and lead customers to discontinue their use of our services.\nIn addition, security breaches could result in a violation of privacy and other applicable laws, thereby exposing us to potentially significant legal or financial exposure to government (including overseas governments) actions and private litigation. Governmental agencies (both domestic and foreign) investigating any such breaches may seek to impose fines or other monetary penalties on us or to seek injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security costs and adversely impact our operations.\nWe rely on third parties for various Internet and processing services.\nOur operations depend on a number of third parties for Internet access and delivery services. We have limited control over these third parties and no long-term relationships with any of them. For example, we do not own a gateway onto the Internet, but, instead, rely on Internet service providers to connect our website to the Internet. Should the third parties that we rely on for Internet access or delivery services be unable to serve our needs for a sustained time period whether as a result of a strike, or a natural disaster or for any other reason, our revenues and business could be harmed.\nAcquisitions, the commencement of new businesses and expansion into overseas markets, present risks, and we may be unable to achieve our financial and strategic goals related to those activities.\nThere may be opportunities that present themselves to acquire existing businesses, commence new businesses or expand our markets through foreign expansion that would give us the opportunity to increase our revenues and our earnings. The purchase or commencement of a new business , or the expansion of our overseas businesses, however, present a number of risks and uncertainties, including (i) difficulties in integrating a new business or a new location into our existing operations, as a result of which we may incur increased operating costs that can adversely affect our operating results; (ii) the risk that our current and planned facilities, computer systems and personnel and controls will not be adequate to support our expanded operations; (iii) the diversion of management time and capital resources from our existing businesses, which could adversely affect the performance of our existing businesses and our operating results; (iv) dependence on key management personnel of the acquired or newly started businesses or at the new geographic locations and the risk that we will be unable to integrate or retain such personnel; and (v) the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business or overseas operations may not be realized or changes we make to an acquired business may harm the performance of that business, in which event we will not be able to achieve an acceptable return or we may incur losses on new investments.\nWe depend on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and competitive position. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual and other proprietary rights may prove to be inadequate to prevent imitation of our services or products, especially in international markets, or to prevent others from claiming violations of their intellectual and proprietary rights by us. In addition, others may develop similar trade secrets or other intellectual property independently or assert rights in our intellectual and other proprietary rights that could lead them to seek to block sales of our services based on allegations that use of some of our marks or other intellectual property constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights.\nOur unregistered trademarks could conflict with trademarks of others.\nWe have not conducted an exhaustive search of possible prior users of our unregistered trademarks or service marks. Therefore, it is possible that our use of some of these trademarks or service marks may conflict with the rights of others. As a result, we could face litigation or incur liabilities for infringing the intellectual rights of others or lose the use of some of these trademarks or service marks, all of which could have an adverse effect on our name recognition and result in a decrease in our revenues and an increase in our expenses.\nThe imposition of government regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nWith the exception of state laws applicable to autograph authentication, the collectible coin and other high-value collectibles markets are not currently subject to direct federal, state, local or overseas regulation. However, from time to time government authorities discuss additional regulations which could impose restrictions on the collectibles industry, such as regulating collectibles as securities or requiring collectibles dealers to meet registration or reporting requirements, or regulating the conduct of collectibles auction businesses. Adoption of laws or regulations of this nature could lead to a decline in sales and purchases of collectibles and, therefore, also to a decline in the volume of coins, trading cards and other collectibles that are submitted to us for authentication and grading.\nThe market for our shares is limited, which may adversely affect the trading value and liquidity of our common stock.\nThe trading volume of our shares is relatively low, at a daily average of approximately 67,000 shares during the 90 trading days ended July 8, 2019, which reduces the liquidity of our shares, making it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares if the need to do so arises. The low trading volumes may depress, and make it more difficult to achieve increases in, the trading prices of our shares.\nIf our quarterly results are below market expectations, the price of our common stock may decline.\nMany factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, can affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which makes the prediction of our future financial results difficult and uncertain. These factors include:\n\u25a0\nperiod to period, including quarterly increases or decreases in the numbers and mix of collectibles graded between coins, trading cards and autographs, including the level of modern coin programs (domestically and/or overseas);\n\u25a0\nchanges in and the seasonality of the coin markets in the U.S. and China;\n\u25a0\nchanges in market conditions that can affect the demand for our authentication and grading services, such as a decline in the popularity of certain collectibles and volatility in the prices of gold and other precious metals, or the existence, popularity or the absence of U.S. Mint programs;\n\u25a0\nchanges in economic conditions that reduce the availability of disposable income or that may cause collectors and collectibles dealers to reduce their purchases of collectibles, which could result in declines in the demand for the services we provide; and\n\u25a0\nthe actions of our competitors.\nIf, as a result of these or other conditions or factors, our quarterly operating results fall below market expectations, some of our stockholders may sell their shares, which could adversely affect the trading prices of our common stock. Additionally, in the past, companies that have experienced declines in the trading prices of their shares due to events of this nature have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we become involved in a securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, thus harming our business.\nProvisions in our charter documents or in Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult or delay a change in control, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, including those listed below, that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if that change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders:\n\u25a0\nour board of directors has the authority to issue additional common stock and preferred stock and to determine the price, rights and preferences of any new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u25a0\nthere are limitations on who can call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u25a0\nstockholders may not take action by written consent; and\n\u25a0\nIn addition, provisions of Delaware law and provisions of our stock incentive plans may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or unsolicited acquisition proposals.", "PERMNO": 87379, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "CLCT"}
