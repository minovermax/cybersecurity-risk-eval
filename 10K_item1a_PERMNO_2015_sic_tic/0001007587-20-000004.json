You should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. If any of these risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe have a history of losses and are uncertain when we may regain profitability.\nWe recorded substantial losses from continuing operations in 2019 and in each of the last three fiscal years. We expect to incur substantial losses in the near future as we continue to bear the expenses of maintaining two satellite networks during the transition of our mini-VSAT customers from our legacy network to our HTS network, as we increase satellite capacity to handle our growing subscriber base, as we continue to shift our business from a model based primarily on product sales to a model based primarily on recurring revenue, and as we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing products and develop new products, including our photonic chip-based fiber optic gyro. In upcoming quarters, we expect to invest substantially in the development of our photonic chip-based fiber optic gyro in an effort to take advantage of opportunities we may have in the autonomous vehicle and other markets. We expect that, as we increase our investments in these and other areas, including, for example, our Internet of Things (IoT) product, our losses will grow. Moreover, the sale of our profitable Videotel business in May 2019 will complicate our ability to reduce our losses and regain profitability. Although the sale of the Videotel business generated substantial proceeds that enabled us to reduce our indebtedness, the net proceeds from the sale will allow us to continue to incur significant operating losses for only a limited period of time. In order to regain profitability, we must successfully complete the transition of our mini-VSAT customers to our HTS network and continue to introduce new and improved products in order to maintain and improve our competitive position and generate revenue. Our inability to accomplish any of these goals could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and we cannot assure you when, or whether, we will regain profitability.\nWe expect that our AgilePlans pricing model for our mini-VSAT broadband business will continue to adversely affect our revenues at least in the short term.\nIn April 2017, we launched AgilePlans, our all-inclusive connectivity-as-a-service, or CaaS, usage-based pricing model for our mini-VSAT broadband service. Under this CaaS model, we charge subscribers a monthly fee for satellite communication hardware, shipping and installation, maintenance and support, airtime and voice services, a service management portal and certain basic content services. AgilePlans customers do not make long-term commitments and can cancel their AgilePlans subscription service at any time. In 2019, AgilePlans revenue comprised 10% of our total revenue. Under this model, we retain ownership of our satellite equipment and do not sell it to subscribers; accordingly, to the extent that customers continue to adopt this subscription model, our revenues from product sales will continue to decline, and our provision of this equipment to subscribers will continue to increase our capital expenditures, which over time will increase our operating expenses as we depreciate these assets. Similarly, revenues from other services included in the plans, which have previously been sold separately, will also decline. In May 2019, we sold our Videotel business and the services offered by the Videotel business have historically been included in our AgilePlans programs. Although we retained the right to continue to offer Videotel services as a part of our AgilePlans programs for a period of time, any discontinuation of the Videotel services may reduce the attractiveness of our AgilePlans programs. Although our goal with the AgilePlans pricing model is to increase the number of subscribers and thereby increase our overall mobile connectivity revenues, the pricing model is still relatively untested and may have unanticipated consequences for our business if adopted on a large scale. There can be no assurance that customers will continue to adopt the AgilePlans pricing model or that revenues from our AgilePlans will offset the loss of other revenue and increase our overall mobile connectivity revenues. Accordingly, an expansion of the AgilePlans pricing model may continue to lead to lower overall revenues in our mobile connectivity segment on either a short-term or long-term basis. Further, because we retain ownership of the satellite communications equipment provided to subscribers under the AgilePlans, we may incur increased costs, including write-offs seeking to recover equipment from any customers who may default on payment or transition to another service. Adoption of the same or similar pricing models by competitors may lead to significant price competition, which could also adversely affect our revenues.\nThe launch of our high-throughput satellite network is causing us to incur significant additional operating costs and may create technical challenges and management distraction that will adversely affect our operating profit.\nIn November 2017, we launched our high-throughput satellite, or HTS, communications service that uses Intelsat\u2019s Global IntelsatOne Flex managed services and SKY-Perfect JSAT capacity. We also operate a global network of leased satellite transponders and terrestrial teleports in cooperation with ViaSat, Inc. We anticipate that the HTS network may eventually significantly reduce costs and enhance the capabilities of the satellite communications services that we offer to our customers. In the near term, however, the launch of the HTS network has resulted and will result in additional operating costs arising from the need to operate both the HTS network and the legacy network. The operation of the HTS network may also present technical challenges arising from Intelsat\u2019s use of the relatively new iDirect Velocity technology for the coding and modulation of satellite signals. Further, the operational requirements associated with the HTS network may continue to require significant attention from our management, marketing, sales, and technical teams, potentially distracting them from other opportunities to further develop our services and increase our customer base. Finally, our current focus on the HTS network creates potential risks with respect to the continued operation of our existing satellite communications network and our contractual arrangement with ViaSat and satellite operators. Our arrangement with ViaSat is currently scheduled to expire in 2021. The arrangement with ViaSat and satellite operators will need to be phased out over a period of several years, but the reliability of the existing satellite network will need to be maintained during the entirety of the wind-down period.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to modification and interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, the SEC, and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which substantially revised revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. We implemented this new revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this new standard is having a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including delays in recognition of revenue for certain mini-VSAT Broadband services and hardware contracts and balance sheet impacts relating to accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities. These or other changes in accounting principles are adversely affecting our reported financial results, including a meaningful increase to our accumulated deficit upon adoption. Moreover, our system of internal controls was originally designed to address previous standards for revenue recognition (Topic 605), and the relatively minor modifications we have made to our internal controls to address the new standard may be insufficient to implement the new standard accurately or in full. In the third quarter of 2019, we identified an error relating to our treatment of sales-type leases of our marine mobile communications products, under which we had generally deferred recognition of product revenue and associated product costs rather than recognizing those items upon shipment. Although we determined that this error was immaterial to our financial statements, it is possible that our financial statements contain other errors that, if identified, would be material. Any insufficiencies or errors in implementation could lead to mistakes in, or delays in filing, our consolidated financial statements as well as deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, any of which could lead to additional accounting, legal and other expenses, potential restatements, loss of investor confidence, enforcement actions by governmental authorities, securities class actions and other adverse consequences.\nOur revenues and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic turmoil in the markets we serve, political events, macroeconomic conditions, credit tightening and associated declines in consumer and enterprise spending.\nEconomic conditions in the various geographic markets we serve have experienced significant turmoil over the last several years, including slow economic activity, tight credit markets, inflation and deflation concerns, low consumer confidence, limited capital spending, adverse business conditions, war and refugee crises in the Middle East and Europe, terrorist attacks, the anticipated departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, leadership transitions in the United Kingdom, the changes in government priorities, trade wars, a government shutdown, gridlock from a divided Congress, and liquidity concerns. These factors vary in intensity by region. These conditions can make it difficult for businesses, governments and consumers to accurately forecast and plan future activities. Many governments, including the US government, are experiencing significant deficits that have caused and may continue to cause them to curtail spending significantly and/or reallocate funds away from defense programs. There can be no assurances that government programs to improve economic conditions will be effective. As a result of these and other factors, customers and government entities could continue to slow or suspend spending on our products and services. We may also incur increased credit losses and need to further increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would have a negative impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing, duration, or ultimate impact of the turmoil in our markets. We expect our business to continue to be adversely impacted by this turmoil to varying degrees and for varying amounts of time, in all our geographic markets.\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nChina and other countries are experiencing outbreaks of coronavirus, which is continuing to spread to other countries, including countries in which we, our customers and our suppliers do business. Governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Other organizations and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas. Travel restrictions and safety precautions have limited our field service engineers from servicing and installing our equipment in the certain regions of Asia. Although we are unable to predict the precise impact of the coronavirus on our business, our mobile communications business in particular depends to a large extent on travel. We anticipate that, unless the outbreak is swiftly contained, governmental, individual, business and other organizational measures to limit the spread of the virus will adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. We continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made some modifications to our operations because of the coronavirus. For example, we have asked some of our employees to alter or cancel travel plans involving affected areas. Major industry events in the region have been cancelled thus reducing our ability to meet with existing and potential new customers. This or any other outbreak and any additional preventative or protective actions that may be taken in response to this or any other global health threat or pandemic may result in additional business and/or operational disruption. Our customers\u2019 businesses could be disrupted, and our revenues could be adversely affected. Additionally, global economic disruptions like coronavirus could negatively impact our supply chain and cause delays in the delivery of raw materials, components and other supplies that we need to conduct our operations. We may be unable to locate replacement materials, components or other supplies, and ongoing delays could reduce sales and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business will depend on many factors beyond our control, including the speed of contagion, the development and implementation of effective preventative measures and possible treatments, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel and other activity, and public reactions to these factors.\nTurmoil in U.S. trade policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe U.S. administration is continuing to alter the U.S.\u2019s approach to international trade, often in unpredictable ways, and is renegotiating, and may terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries. In addition, the U.S. administration has imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods and may increase tariffs or impose new ones, and certain foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. goods and may increase tariffs or impose new ones. We derive a majority of our revenues from international sales, which makes us especially vulnerable to increased tariffs. The changes have created ongoing turmoil in international trade relations and it is unclear what future actions the U.S. government or foreign governments will or will not take with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. Current trade negotiations may fail, which may exacerbate these risks. Ongoing or new trade wars or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies could reduce demand for our products and services, increase our costs, reduce our profitability, adversely impact our supply chain or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFluctuations in oil prices may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOil prices have declined significantly since the peak in 2014. West Texas Intermediate oil prices dropped from a high of $107.26 per barrel on June 20, 2014 to a low of $26.21 per barrel on February 11, 2016. Customers of our mobile satellite business include offshore support vessel companies that participate in or depend on the offshore oil industry. Although prices have recovered somewhat in recent periods, the cycle of fluctuations in worldwide oil prices has had a significant impact on the financial performance of companies in this sector of the economy, and as a result demand for new products and services has declined severely since 2015 as they have sought to reduce expenditures. In addition, we have experienced a higher customer churn rate primarily attributed to customers that operate in this sector, where the sale, decommissioning, or laying up of vessels has led to a higher rate of airtime plan terminations and suspensions. These trends could continue to limit or reduce demand for our mobile connectivity products and services from companies in this sector, which could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur financial performance is impacted by U.S. government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding and termination.\nWe have historically sold a substantial portion of our TACNAV and FOG products and services to the U.S. government and its contractors. We are unable to predict the impact on our business of Congressional gridlock, tax reform and government policies, which have increased already significant budget deficits and may lead to an overall reduction in federal spending. A reduction in sales to the U.S. government or its contractors, whether due to lack of funding, for convenience or otherwise, or the occurrence of delays, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the government's convenience or for default based on performance. Government customers can also decline to exercise previously disclosed contract options. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor.\nWe must generate a certain level of sales of the TracPhone V-HTS series products and our mini-VSAT Broadband service in order to maintain or improve our service gross margins.\nAs a result of our mini-VSAT Broadband network infrastructure, our cost of service sales includes certain fixed costs that do not generally vary in proportion with the volume of service sales, and we have almost no ability to reduce these fixed costs in the short term. These fixed costs have increased significantly each year as we have further expanded our network to accommodate additional subscriber demand and/or coverage areas, and we expect that this trend will continue in 2020 and beyond, particularly as we expand our HTS network. If sales of our TracPhone V-HTS series products and the mini-VSAT Broadband service, including through our AgilePlans subscription model, do not generate the level of revenue that we expect or if those revenues decline, our service gross margins may continue to decline. As our market share has increased, we have also experienced a general increase in customer termination and suspension rates, compounded by accelerated declines in sales for vessels servicing the oil supply market with some bulk carriers, and lower unit sales of our mobile connectivity hardware, both in the United States and Europe. The failure to improve our mini-VSAT Broadband service gross margins and unit or subscriber sales would have a material adverse effect on our overall profitability.\nCompetition may limit our ability to sell our mobile connectivity products and services and inertial navigation products.\nThe mobile connectivity markets and defense navigation and inertial navigation markets in which we participate are very competitive, and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, which could impair our ability to sell our products and services. For example, improvements in the performance of lower-cost gyros by competitors could potentially jeopardize sales of our FOGs and FOG-based systems. As our market share in the mobile satellite communication market has grown, competition has intensified significantly, most notably from companies that seek to compete primarily on price. These companies may continue to implement price reductions and discounts for both products and services, which have required us to reduce our prices or offer discounts in order to maintain or increase our market share. Some of our VSAT competitors have also leveraged partnerships amongst themselves in order to capture larger combined market share. We anticipate that this trend of substantial competition will continue. Further, some of the companies that we depend on to supply us with capacity on satellite communications networks may vertically integrate by introducing their own products and services in competition with our products and services, thus potentially incentivizing them to refrain from providing satellite network capacity to us, or to make it available only on less favorable terms.\nIn the marine market for satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, RayMarine (Intellian made), KNS, and Sea King (King Controls).\nIn the marine market for voice, fax, data, and Internet communications equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, Jotron AS, KNS Inc., Inmarsat, AddValue, and Iridium Satellite LLC.\nIn the marine market for high-speed voice, fax, data, and Internet services, we compete primarily with Inmarsat, Marlink, Speedcast, Network Innovations, Global Eagle Entertainment and Isotropic Network. We also face competition from providers of low-speed data services, which include Inmarsat, Globalstar LP, and Iridium Satellite LLC.\nIn the market for land mobile satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with King Controls and Winegard Company.\nIn the markets for media content, the KVH Media Group competes primarily with Swank Motion Pictures and NewspaperDirect Inc.\nIn the inertial navigation markets, we compete primarily with Honeywell International Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Goodrich Aerospace, IAI, Fizoptica, SAGEM, and Systron Donner Inertial.\nAmong the factors that may affect our ability to compete in our markets are the following:\n\u2022\nmany of our primary competitors are well-established companies that generally have substantially greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which help them to compete more effectively in the market for mobile broadband solutions for larger fleets of vessels;\n\u2022\nthe infrastructure costs for potential customers to switch from an existing service provider to our service may create disincentives for customers to enter into agreements for our services, even when those services are more attractive or cost-effective;\n\u2022\nmany of our primary competitors have well-established and/or growing partner programs, which pose a threat of multiplying their market influence;\n\u2022\nproduct and service improvements, new product and service developments or price reductions by competitors may weaken customer acceptance of, and reduce demand for, our products and services;\n\u2022\nnew technology or market trends may disrupt or displace a need for our products and services;\n\u2022\nour competitors may have access to a broader array of media content than we do, which may cause customers to prefer competitors\u2019 media offerings; and\n\u2022\nour competitors may have lower production costs than we do, which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering discounts and other promotions.\nThe emergence of a competing small maritime VSAT antenna and complementary service or other similar service could reduce the competitive advantage we believe we currently enjoy with our smaller TracPhone V-HTS series antennas and Ku-band mini-VSAT Broadband service, or with our TracPhone V11-HTS antenna and our C/Ku-band mini-VSAT Broadband service.\nOur TracPhone V-HTS systems offer customers a range of benefits due to their integrated design, hardware costs that are lower than existing maritime Ku-band VSAT systems, and broadband technology. We currently compete against companies that offer established maritime Ku-band VSAT service using, in some cases, antennas 1-meter in diameter or larger. While we are unaware of any company offering a 37-cm VSAT solution comparable to our TracPhone V3-HTS, we are encountering regional competition from companies offering 60-cm VSAT systems and services, which are comparable in size to our TracPhone V7-HTS. Likewise, our TracPhone V11-HTS, at 1.1-meters in diameter, is approximately 85% smaller and lighter than competing C-band maritime VSAT systems, which use antennas in excess of 2.4-meters in diameter to provide similar global services. We are unaware of any competitor currently offering a similar size solution for global C-band coverage, but any introduction of such a product could adversely impact our success. In addition, other companies could replicate some of the distinguishing features of our TracPhone V-HTS series products, which could potentially reduce the appeal of our solution, increase price competition, and adversely affect sales. We compete against Inmarsat's Fleet Xpress service, a global Ka-band mobile VSAT service that Inmarsat claims is faster and has a lower price per megabit than existing Ku-band services. This service may continue to adversely impact sales of our mini-VSAT Broadband service and related equipment. Our arrangement to use the IntelsatOne Flex service for our HTS network is not exclusive, and competitors\u2019 use of this service could also adversely impact sales. Moreover, consumers may choose other services such as FleetBroadband or Iridium OpenPort for their service coverage at potentially lower hardware costs despite higher service costs and slower data rates.\nIf we are unable to improve our existing mobile connectivity and inertial navigation products and services and develop new, innovative products and services, our sales and market share may decline.\nThe markets for mobile connectivity products and services and inertial navigation products and services are each characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations, and evolving industry standards. For example, we now compete with Inmarsat's Fleet Xpress satellite communications products and services. If we fail to make innovations in our existing products and services and reduce the costs of our products and services in a timely way, our market share may decline. For example, the introductions of our TracVision TV-series antennas in 2014 occurred later than we had anticipated, which we believe led certain customers to purchase competing products. Products or services using new technologies, or emerging industry standards, could render our products and services obsolete. If our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products or services that eliminate technological advantages our products or services may have in a market or otherwise outperform our products or services, or are perceived by consumers as doing so, we may be unable to compete successfully in the markets affected by these changes.\nWe are devoting significant resources to research and development efforts that may be unsuccessful.\nResearch and development in our industry is inherently complex and uncertain, and our current and anticipated research and development projects may not achieve the results we seek. For example, we are currently investing in the development of a new, low-cost FOG for the autonomous vehicle market that will satisfy rigorous performance expectations but that can be manufactured at a significantly lower cost than our current FOGs. We plan to invest significantly to substantially accelerate this development program. The autonomous vehicle market is extremely competitive and evolving rapidly, factors that may afford us only a brief window to develop and introduce a competitively priced product before customers make design choices that could limit our opportunities or exclude us from the market altogether. We are also seeking to develop enhancements to our current generation of TACNAV products. As with all development projects, we may encounter unforeseen technical challenges, delays, cost overruns, licensing requirements or other problems that prevent us from achieving our goals, as a result of which we could lose significant market opportunities. Our research and development expenses increased 7% from 2018 to 2019, and the financial resources that we can devote to our research and development efforts may be insufficient to achieve our goals. Our efforts may not result in any viable products or may result in products whose performance, features, price or availability may not be attractive to customers or which we cannot manufacture and sell profitably. As a result, our efforts may not result in products that generate meaningful revenues or earnings in the near term, or at all. We may expend a significant amount of resources in unsuccessful research and development efforts, and any failure to achieve our research and development goals may harm our reputation with customers or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe purchasing and delivery schedules and priorities of the U.S. military and foreign governments are often unpredictable.\nWe sell our FOG systems and tactical navigation products and services to U.S. and foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors. These customers often use a competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. Factors that affect their purchasing and delivery decisions include:\n\u2022\nincreasing budgetary pressures, which may reduce or delay funding for military programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in modernization plans for military equipment;\n\u2022\nchanges in tactical navigation requirements;\n\u2022\nglobal conflicts impacting troop deployment, including troop withdrawals;\n\u2022\npriorities for current battlefield operations;\n\u2022\nnew military and operational doctrines that affect military equipment needs;\n\u2022\nsales cycles that are long and difficult to predict;\n\u2022\nshifting response time and/or delays in the approval process associated with the export licenses we must obtain prior to the international shipment of certain of our military products;\n\u2022\ndelays in military procurement schedules; and\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing and acceptance of our products, including delays resulting from changes in customer specifications.\nThese factors periodically cause substantial fluctuations in sales of our TACNAV and FOG products and services from period to period. For example, TACNAV product sales increased $0.4 million, or 9%, from 2018 to 2019. Similarly, sales of our FOG products decreased $1.7 million, or 6%, from 2018 to 2019. In October 2014, we received a $19.0 million TACNAV product and services contract with an international military customer which included program management and engineering services delivered through 2017 and hardware shipments that were completed in the third quarter of 2016. These types of large orders contribute to the unpredictability of our revenues from period to period. Government customers may change defense spending priorities at any time.\nSales of our FOG systems and TACNAV products generally consist of a few large orders, and the delay or cancellation of a single order will substantially reduce our net sales.\nKVH products sold to customers in the defense industry are purchased through orders that can generally range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars. For example, we received an order for FOG products of $4.0 million in October 2019 and orders for TACNAV products and services of $6.7 million and $3.5 million in September 2019 and April 2017, respectively. Orders of this size are often unpredictable and difficult to replicate. As a result, the delay or cancellation of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations. We routinely experience repeated and unanticipated delays in defense orders, which make our revenues and operating results less predictable. Because our inertial navigation products typically have relatively higher product gross margins than our mobile connectivity products, the loss of an order for inertial navigation products could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOnly a few customers account for a substantial portion of our inertial navigation revenues, and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales.\nWe derive a significant portion of our inertial navigation revenues from a small number of customers, many of whom are contractors for the U.S. government. The loss of business from any of these customers or delays in orders could substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations and could seriously harm our business. Since we are often awarded a contract as a subcontractor to a major defense supplier that is engaged in a competitive bidding process as prime contractor for a major weapons procurement program, our revenues depend significantly on the success of the prime contractors with which we align ourselves.\nCommercial sales of our inertial navigation products are unpredictable.\nFluctuating commercial sales of our inertial navigation products are making it more difficult to predict our future revenues. We have been marketing our inertial navigation products, particularly our FOG products and systems, to original equipment manufacturers for incorporation into commercial products, such as navigation and positioning systems for various applications, including precision mapping, dynamic surveying, self-driving and other autonomous vehicles, train location control and track geometry measurement systems, industrial robotics, and optical stabilization. Because we sell these products to original equipment manufacturers rather than end-users, we have less information about market trends and other developments affecting the buying patterns of end-users and, as a result, may be unable to forecast demand for these products accurately. Sales of FOGs for commercial applications decreased from 2018 to 2019; however, sales can significantly increase or decrease quarter-to-quarter due to our customer mix. Moreover, sales of these products for commercial applications depend on the success of our customers\u2019 products, and any decline in sales of our customers\u2019 products would reduce demand for our products.\nOur results of operations are adversely affected by unseasonably cold weather, prolonged winter conditions, disasters or similar events.\nOur leisure marine business is highly seasonal, and seasonality can also impact our commercial marine business. Historically, we have generated the majority of our leisure marine product revenues during the first and second quarters of each year, and these revenues typically decline in the third and fourth quarters of each year, compared to the first two quarters. Temporary suspensions of our airtime services typically increase in the third and fourth quarters of each year as boats are placed out of service during winter months. Our leisure marine business is also significantly affected by the weather. Unseasonably cool weather, prolonged winter conditions, hurricanes, unusual amounts of rain, and natural and other disasters may decrease boating, which could reduce our revenues. Specifically, we may encounter a decrease in new airtime activations as well as an increase in the number of cancellations or temporary suspensions of our airtime service.\nAn increasing portion of our revenues derives from commercial leases of mobile connectivity equipment, rather than sales, which increases our credit and collection risk.\nWe are actively seeking to increase revenues from the commercial markets for our mini-VSAT Broadband service, particularly shipping companies and other companies that deploy a fleet of vessels. In marketing this service, we offer leasing arrangements for the TracPhone antennas to both commercial and leisure customers. If commercial leases become increasingly popular with our customers, we could face increased risks of default under those leases. Defaults could increase our costs of collection (including costs of retrieving or abandoning leased equipment) and reduce the amount we collect from customers, which could harm our results of operations. Moreover, fleet sales are likely to be less common than, and perhaps substantially larger than, our typical orders, which could lead to increased variability in our quarterly revenues and gross margin realization.\nOur ability to compete in the maritime airtime services market will be impaired if we are unable to provide sufficient service capacity to meet customer demand.\nWe currently offer our mini-VSAT Broadband service in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Australian and New Zealand waters. In the future, we may need to expand capacity, including under our HTS network, in existing coverage areas to support our subscriber base. If we are unable to reach agreement with third-party satellite providers to support our mini-VSAT Broadband service and its technology or if transponder capacity is unavailable to meet growing demand in a given region, our ability to provide airtime services will be at risk and could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the scope of our foreign sales and foreign operations, we face significant exposure to movements in exchange rates for foreign currencies, particularly the pound sterling and the euro. During 2018 and 2019, the U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against certain foreign currencies, which adversely affected revenues reported in U.S. dollars and decreased the reported value of our assets in foreign countries. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen (as has recently occurred relative to the pound sterling), our revenues denominated in foreign currencies but reported in U.S. dollars, as well as the reported value of our assets in foreign countries, would be commensurately lower.\nWe also have intragroup receivables and liabilities, such as loans, that can generate significant foreign currency effects. Changes in exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling, could lead to the recognition of unrealized foreign exchange losses.\nMoreover, certain of our products and services are sold internationally in U.S. dollars; if the U.S. dollar strengthens, the relative cost of these products and services to customers located in foreign countries would increase, which could adversely affect export sales. In addition, most of our financial obligations, including payments under our outstanding debt obligations, must be satisfied in U.S. dollars. Our exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates may change over time as our business practices evolve and could result in increased costs or reduced revenue and could adversely affect our cash flow. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and may have a significant impact on our operating results. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can cost-effectively mitigate this exposure.\nBrexit and political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and Europe could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations and disrupt our operations.\nWe have significant operations in the United Kingdom, including the major portion of our KVH Media Group operations. The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, or Brexit, and the recent change in governmental leadership in the United Kingdom have caused significant political uncertainty in both the United Kingdom and the European Union. The impact of Brexit and the resulting turmoil on the political and economic future of the United Kingdom and the European Union is uncertain, and we may be adversely affected in ways we do not currently anticipate. Brexit may result in a significant change in the British regulatory environment, which would likely increase our compliance costs. Customers and other businesses may curtail expenditures, including for purchases of our products and services. We may find it more difficult to conduct business in the United Kingdom and the European Union, as Brexit may result in increased restrictions on the movement of capital, goods and personnel. Depending on the outcome of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding the terms of Brexit, we may decide to relocate or otherwise alter our European operations to respond to the new business, legal, regulatory, tax and trade environments that may result. Brexit may materially and adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees and could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, higher tariffs and taxes, and lower earnings and cash flow.\nTight credit availability, environmental concerns and ongoing low levels of consumer confidence are adversely affecting sales of our mobile satellite TV products.\nFactors such as tight credit, environmental protection laws and ongoing low levels of consumer confidence can materially and adversely affect sales of larger vehicles and vessels for which our mobile satellite TV products are designed, such as yachts and recreational vehicles. Many customers finance their purchases of these vehicles and vessels, and tight credit availability can reduce demand for both these vehicles and vessels and our mobile satellite TV products. Moreover, financing for these purchases has sometimes been unavailable or more difficult to obtain. The increased cost of operating these vehicles and vessels can adversely affect demand for our mobile satellite TV products.\nThe agreements governing the indebtedness under our secured credit facility subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nThe agreements governing the indebtedness under our secured credit facility subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nacquire other businesses or make investments;\n\u2022\nraise additional capital;\n\u2022\nincur other debt or create liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions;\n\u2022\nprepay indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nmerge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.\nOur secured credit facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants that we may not satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under our secured credit facility and the limitation of our ability to borrow additional funds in the future.\nAlthough no amount were outstanding under the agreements as of December 31, 2019, the agreements governing our secured credit facility subject us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include covenants pertaining to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and covenants requiring the mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the revolver under specified circumstances, including (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain dispositions to the extent not reinvested in our business within a stated period, (ii) 50% of the net cash proceeds from stated equity issuances, and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain receipts above certain threshold amounts outside the ordinary course of business. The consolidated leverage ratio may not be greater than 2.50:1.00 and declines to 2.00:1.00 on December 31, 2020. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than 1.25:1.00. If we violate any of these covenants, any outstanding debt under our secured credit facility could become immediately due and payable, our lenders could proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness, and our ability to borrow additional funds in the future could be limited or terminated. Alternatively, we could be forced to refinance or renegotiate the terms and conditions of our secured credit facility, including the interest rates, financial and restrictive covenants and security requirements of the secured credit facility, on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us.\nOur mobile satellite products currently depend on satellite services, gateway teleports and terrestrial networks provided by third parties, and a disruption in those services could adversely affect sales.\nOur satellite antenna products include the equipment necessary to utilize satellite services. We do not own the satellites that directly provide two-way satellite communications or the terrestrial networks that interconnect our facilities with the satellite teleports that communicate with the satellites. We currently offer satellite television products compatible with the DIRECTV and DISH Network services in the United States, the Bell TV service in Canada, the Sky Mexico service and various other regional satellite TV services in other parts of the world.\nSES, Eutelsat, Sky Perfect-JSAT, Telesat, EchoStar, Intelsat and Star One currently provide the satellite capacity to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service and our TracPhone V-IP and V-HTS series products. Intelsat also currently provides our C-Band satellite coverage. In addition, we have agreements with various teleports and Internet service providers around the globe to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service. The terrestrial fiber links that we use to connect with the Internet and to move our voice and data services between our facilities and the various satellite earth stations that support our services are provided to us through numerous service providers, some of which have contractual relationships with our satellite service providers and not directly with us. We rely on Inmarsat for satellite communications services for our FleetBroadband and FleetOne compatible TracPhone products. We also have an arrangement with Iridium for additional satellite communications services that we make available to our customers as a backup option to provide communications redundancy with our primary service offerings.\nWe exercise little or no control over these third-party providers of satellite, teleport and terrestrial network services, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. Due to our reliance on these service providers, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Service disruption or outages, regardless of whether they are caused by our service, the equipment or services of our third-party service providers, or our customers\u2019 or their equipment and systems, may result in loss of market acceptance of our service, and any necessary repairs or other remedial actions may cause us to incur significant costs and expenses. Any failure on the part of third-party service providers to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security could harm our relationships with our customers, result in claims for credits or damages, damage our reputation, significantly reduce customer demand for our solution and seriously harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIf customers become dissatisfied with the programming, pricing, service, availability or other aspects of any of these satellite services, or if any one or more of these services becomes unavailable for any reason, we could suffer a substantial decline in sales of our satellite products. There may be no alternative service provider available in a particular geographic area, and our modem or other technology may not be compatible with the technology of any alternative service provider that may be available. Even if available, delays caused by switching our technology to another service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could materially harm our customer relationships, business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the unexpected failure of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services, which could reduce the demand for, or customer satisfaction with, our products.\nWe rely upon third-party communications technology and satellite providers to permit two-way broadband Internet via our TracPhone V-HTS and V-IP series antennas, and any disruption in the availability of this technology will adversely affect sales.\nOur mini-VSAT Broadband service relies on broadband communications technology developed by ViaSat and Intelsat for use with satellite capacity controlled by SES, Eutelsat, Sky Perfect-JSAT, Telesat, Echostar, Intelsat and Star One. Our TracPhone broadband satellite terminals combine our stabilized antenna technology with this third-party mobile broadband technology, including modems, to provide two-way broadband Internet service. This third-party technology is also integrated within the satellite hubs that support this service. Sales of the TracPhone V-HTS series products and our mini-VSAT Broadband service could be disrupted if we fail to receive approval from regulatory authorities to provide our service in the waters of various countries where our customers operate or if there are issues with the availability of the third-party hardware. Moreover, satellite communications technology may continue to evolve, which could reduce the relative attractiveness of the third-party technology we currently offer, and the hardware we use may cease to be compatible with changes in satellite service offerings. As we transition customers to our HTS service over the next few years, we may encounter technological challenges, increased expenses, customer dissatisfaction, inventory obsolescence, interruptions in supply, disruptions in current relationships or arrangements and unforeseen obstacles, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our mobile satellite business, revenues and profitability.\nWe have single dedicated manufacturing facilities for each of our mobile connectivity and inertial navigation product categories, and any significant disruption to a facility will impair our ability to deliver our products.\nWe currently manufacture all of our mobile connectivity products at our manufacturing facility in Middletown, Rhode Island, and the majority of our inertial navigation products at our facility in Tinley Park, Illinois. Some of our production processes are complex, and we may be unable to respond rapidly to the loss of the use of either production facility. For example, our production facilities use some specialized equipment that may take time to replace if they are damaged or become unusable for any reason. In that event, shipments would be delayed, which could result in customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation. Finally, we have only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short term. If short-term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation.\nWe depend on sole or limited source suppliers, and any disruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost.\nWe obtain many key components for our products from third-party suppliers, and in some cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers. Any interruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify and qualify a new source of supply, which could take several weeks, months or longer and could increase our costs significantly. Suppliers might change or discontinue key components, which could require us to modify our product designs. For example, in the past, we have experienced changes in the chemicals used to coat our optical fiber, which changed its characteristics and thereby necessitated design modifications. Department of Defense regulations requiring government contractors to implement processes to avoid counterfeit parts may require us to find new sources of materials or components if the current supplier cannot meet the requirements. In general, we do not have written long-term supply agreements with our suppliers but instead purchase components through purchase orders, which expose us to potential price increases and termination of supply without notice or recourse. It is generally not our practice to carry significant inventories of product components, and this could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier. If we are required to use a new source of materials or components, it could also result in unexpected manufacturing difficulties and could affect product performance and reliability. In addition, from time to time, lead times for certain components can increase significantly due to imbalances in overall market supply and demand. This, in turn, could limit our ability to satisfy the demand for certain of our products on a timely basis and could result in some customer orders being rescheduled or canceled.\nWe may continue to increase the use of international suppliers to source components for our manufacturing operations, which could disrupt our business.\nAlthough we have historically manufactured and sourced raw materials for the majority of our products domestically, in order for us to compete with lower priced competing products while also improving our profitability, in some instances we have found it desirable to source raw materials and manufactured components and assemblies from Europe, Asia, and South America. Reliance on foreign manufacturing and/or raw material supply has lengthened our supply chain and increased the risk that a disruption in that supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nWe depend on cloud-based data services operated by third parties, and any disruption in the operation of these services could harm our business.\nSome of our content services and business records are hosted by various cloud-based data services operated by third parties. Any failure or downtime in one of these services could affect a significant percentage of our customers. Although we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our internal facilities and certain of our external data facilities, we do not control the operation of external facilities. The providers of our data management services have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one or more of our data management service providers is acquired, closes, suffers financial difficulty or is unable to meet our growing capacity needs, we may be required to transfer our data to other services, and we may incur significant costs and service interruptions in connection with doing so, which could harm our reputation with our customers and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions could result in financial difficulties or bankruptcy for any of our suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA deterioration in the current state of worldwide economic conditions and tight credit could present challenges to our suppliers, which could result in disruptions to our business, increase our costs, delay shipment of our products or delivery of services, and impair our ability to generate and recognize revenue. To address their own business challenges, our suppliers may increase prices, reduce the availability of credit, require deposits or advance payments or take other actions that may impose a burden on us.\nThey may also reduce production capacity, slow or delay delivery of products, face challenges meeting our specifications or otherwise fail to meet our requirements. In some cases, our suppliers may face bankruptcy. We may be required to identify, qualify, and engage new suppliers, which would require time and the attention of management. Any of these events could impair our ability to deliver our products and services to customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, cause us to breach our contractual commitments or result in the loss of customers.\nOur media and entertainment business relies on licensing arrangements with content providers, and the loss of or changes in those arrangements could adversely affect our business.\nWe distribute premium news, sports, movies, and music content for commercial and leisure customers in the maritime, hotel, and retail markets. We do not generate this content but instead license the content from third parties on a non-exclusive basis. We do not have long-term license agreements with any content provider. Accordingly, any content provider could terminate our existing arrangements with little or no advance notice or could adversely modify the terms of the arrangement, including initiating potential price increases. Further, the licenses we obtain are limited in scope, and any violation of the terms of a license could expose us to liability for copyright infringement. We pay license fees that are based in part on the revenue we generate from sublicenses, and our licensors generally have the right to audit our records to determine whether we have paid all necessary license fees. Failure to pay required license fees could result in any combination of termination of our license rights, penalties, or damages. The loss of content could adversely affect the attractiveness of our media and entertainment offerings, which could in turn adversely affect our revenues. Any increase in the cost of content could reduce the profitability of these offerings.\nAny failure to maintain and expand our third-party distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for mobile connectivity products and services.\nWe market and sell our mobile connectivity products and services through an international network of independent retailers, chain stores and distributors, as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels, recreational vehicles and buses. Many of our distributors are also responsible for providing onsite support and installation for our products, which requires our distributors to employ highly skilled workers and maintain facilities in locations convenient to our customers, such as at maritime ports. We also expect our distributors to assist us in expanding internationally. Some of our distribution relationships are new, and our new distributors may not be successful in marketing and selling our products and services. In addition, our distribution partners do not have exclusive relationships with us and may sell products of other companies, including competing products, and are generally not required to purchase minimum quantities of our products. Our competitors may be able to cause our current or potential distributors to favor their services over ours, either through financial incentives, technological innovation, by offering a broader array of services to these service providers or otherwise, which could reduce the effectiveness of our use of these distributors. If we fail to maintain relationships with our current distributors, fail to develop relationships with new distributors in new and existing markets, or manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing distributors, or if our distributors are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products and services may decline and our operating results could be harmed.\nOur international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments.\nHistorically, sales to customers outside the United States have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales. We derived 54% and 57% of our revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively, from sales to customers outside the United States. We have foreign sales offices in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Cyprus and the Philippines, as well as a subsidiary in Brazil that manages local sales. However, aside from these international sales offices, substantially all of our personnel and operations, particularly for our mobile connectivity equipment business and our inertial navigation business, are located in the United States. Our limited operations in foreign countries may impair our ability to compete successfully in international markets and to meet the service and support needs of our customers in countries where we have little to no infrastructure. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities, which may increase our costs and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u2022\nretaliatory and other tariffs;\n\u2022\ntechnical challenges we may face in adapting our mobile connectivity products to function with different satellite services and technology in use in various regions around the world;\n\u2022\nsatisfaction of international regulatory requirements and delays and costs associated with procurement of any necessary licenses or permits;\n\u2022\nthe potential unavailability of content licenses covering international waters and foreign locations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the sale of certain inertial navigation products to foreign military and government customers;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of providing customer support in multiple languages;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of managing operations that are international in scope;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets;\n\u2022\npotentially longer sales cycles, which could slow our revenue growth from international sales;\n\u2022\npotentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability in some international markets.\nWe could incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we do not comply with certain regulations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to a number of legal requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the customs, export, trade sanctions and anti-boycott laws of the United States, including those administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, as well as those of other nations in which we do business. In addition, the governments of many of the countries where our customers use our products and services maintain licensing and regulatory requirements for the importation and use of satellite communications and reception equipment, including the use of such equipment in the country\u2019s territorial waters, the transmission of satellite signals on certain radio frequencies, the transmission of voice over Internet services using such equipment, and, in some cases, the reception of certain video programming services. These laws and regulations are changing continuously, and compliance with these laws and regulations is complex. We incur significant costs identifying and maintaining compliance with applicable licensing and regulatory requirements. In addition, our training and compliance programs and our other internal control policies may be insufficient to protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or third-party contractors. Any violation of these requirements by us or our employees, agents or third-party contractors may subject us to significant criminal and civil liability.\nExports of certain inertial navigation products are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and require a license from the U.S. Department of State prior to shipment.\nWe must comply with the United States Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. Certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the ITAR and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. Any changes in export regulations or reclassifications of our products may further restrict the export of our products, and we may cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing regulations. The length of time required by the licensing process can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restriction on the export of a product line or any amount of our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales.\nWe are subject to FCC rules and regulations, and any non-compliance could subject us to FCC enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services.\nThe satellite communications industry is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and, as a result, we are subject to existing and potential FCC regulations relating to privacy, contributions to the Universal Service Fund, or USF, and other requirements. If we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to FCC enforcement actions, substantial fines, penalties, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, could hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell our services to customers and could harm our business and results of operations.\nReform of federal and state USF programs could increase the cost of our service to our customers, diminishing or eliminating our pricing advantage.\nThe FCC has been considering reform or other modifications to its USF program. The way we calculate our contribution to USF may change if the FCC engages in reform or adopts other modifications. In April 2012, the FCC released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to consider reforms to the manner in which companies like us contribute to the federal USF program. In general, the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking indicates that the FCC is considering changes to the companies that should contribute, how contributions should be assessed, and methods to improve the administration of the system. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or its impact on our business at this time. The changes in the leadership of the U.S. Government resulting from the federal election in 2016 may renew interest in completing this proceeding.\nShould the FCC adopt new contribution mechanisms or otherwise modify contribution obligations that increase our contribution burden, we will either need to raise the amount we currently collect from our customers to cover this obligation or absorb the costs, which would reduce our profit margins. The attractiveness of our services may also be reduced as compared to the services of our competitors that do not appear to contribute to USF, or do not do so to the same extent that we do.\nPrivacy concerns and domestic or foreign laws and regulations may reduce demand for our services, increase our costs and harm our business.\nOur company and our customers can potentially use our services to collect, use and store information, including personally identifiable information or other information treated as confidential, regarding the content and manner of usage of our services by them, their employees and maritime crews. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, and may adopt new and more stringent laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of such information obtained from consumers and individuals, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to us and the operations of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand, and any non-compliance with these laws and regulations could lead to significant remediation expenses, fines, penalties or other regulatory liabilities such as orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our privacy practices, as well as reputational damage or third-party lawsuits seeking damages or other relief. For example, the GDPR imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide revenue and \u20ac20 million.\nDomestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may harm our ability, and the ability of our customers, to process, handle, store, use and transmit information, including demographic and personally identifiable information or other information treated as confidential, regarding individual users of the services, which could reduce demand for some of our services, increase our costs and force us to change our business practices. These laws and regulations are still evolving and are likely to be in flux and subject to uncertain interpretation for the foreseeable future. For example, under the GDPR, data protection authorities in each country have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which could create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. Under the CCPA, there is some uncertainty because regulations have not yet been finalized, and it is unclear how the California Attorney General, who has primary enforcement authority, will interpret and enforce the law. Our business could be harmed if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country or inconsistent with our current policies and practices or those of our customers. In addition, although foreign data protection, privacy, and consumer protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR, are often more stringent than those currently in effect in the United States, the CCPA and proposed privacy laws in several states indicate that privacy restrictions in the United States could equal or exceed those under the GDPR.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results.\nWe evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities to acquire other businesses as they arise. The expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing these and other such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we acquire a business, we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own. Moreover, we may be unable to realize the strategic, financial, operational and other benefits we anticipate from any acquisition, and any acquisition may increase our overall operating expenses, including expenses we may incur to complete acquired research and development programs. Competition for acquisition opportunities could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. Further, our approach to acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks, such as:\n\u2022\nentry into new and unfamiliar lines of business or markets, which may present challenges or risks that we did not anticipate;\n\u2022\nentry into new or unfamiliar geographic regions, including exposure to additional tax and regulatory regimes;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncharges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time, attention, and resources;\n\u2022\nloss of key acquired personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial, and administrative systems, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of legal liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlosses arising from impairment charges associated with goodwill or intangible assets.\nFor example, we incurred additional expenses to implement internal control over financial reporting appropriate for a public company at two companies we acquired, which previously operated as private companies not subject to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nIf we cannot effectively manage changes in our rate of growth, our business may suffer.\nWe have previously expanded our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities, and we are continuing to expand our international operations. For example, we expanded our service offerings through acquisitions in 2014 and in 2013. This growth placed a strain on our personnel, management, financial and other resources and increased our operating expenses. If any portion of our business grows more rapidly than we anticipate and we fail to manage that growth properly, we may incur unnecessary expenses, and the efficiency of our operations may decline. If we are unable to adjust our operating expenses on a timely basis in response to changes in revenue cycles, our results of operations may be harmed. To manage changes in our rate of growth effectively, we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nmatch our manufacturing facilities and capacity to demand for our products and services in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nsecure appropriate satellite capacity to match changes in demand for airtime services in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully attract, train, motivate and manage appropriate numbers of employees for manufacturing, sales, marketing and customer support activities;\n\u2022\neffectively manage our inventory and working capital;\n\u2022\nmaintain the efficiencies within our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems; and\n\u2022\nensure that our procedures and internal controls are revised and updated to remain appropriate for the size and scale of our business operations.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our operations, our business will suffer.\nTo meet our growth objectives, we must attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position, which could lead to a significant decline in net sales. We face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.\nOur success depends on the services of our executive officers.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of Martin Kits van Heyningen, our co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board. If we lost the services of Mr. Kits van Heyningen, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. We also depend on the ability of our other executive officers to work effectively as a team. The loss of one or more of our executive officers could impair our ability to manage our business effectively.\nOur business may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology.\nOur ability to compete depends significantly upon our patents, copyrights, source code, and other proprietary technology. The steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us. Our patents will eventually expire and could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights we have under our patents could provide no competitive advantages. Existing trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws offer only limited protection. Customers or others with access to our proprietary or licensed media content could copy that content without permission or otherwise violate the terms of our customer agreements, which would adversely affect our revenues and could impair our relationships with content providers. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation. Furthermore, other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights. Any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our competitive position, which could lead to a substantial reduction in net sales.\nIf we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, disruptive and expensive, distract the attention of management, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail.\nAlso, we have delivered certain technical data and information to the U.S. government under procurement contracts, and it may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents, patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property rights of others.\nWe do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies.\nFrom time to time we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, and we may face similar claims in the future. For example, we were sued for patent infringement in 2015, and we settled this claim in January 2016 with a payment of cash to Advanced Media Network. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against or settling the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and, in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity breaches could disrupt our operations, expose us to liability, damage our reputation, and require us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and third-party systems, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal information of our customers. We also retain sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personally identifiable information, credit card information, and usage data of our employees and customers on our computer networks and those of third parties. Although we take certain protective measures and endeavor to modify them as we believe circumstances warrant, invasive technologies and techniques continue to evolve rapidly, and increasingly sophisticated hacking organizations are targeting business systems. As a result, the computer systems, software and networks that we use are vulnerable to disruption, shutdown, unauthorized access, misuse, erasure, alteration, employee error, phishing, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. The protective measures on which we rely may be inadequate to detect future cybersecurity breaches or determine the extent of any breach, and there can be no assurance that undetected breaches have not already occurred. Any security breach may compromise information stored on networks we use and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers', our business partners' or our employees' sensitive information. Public reports suggest that cybersecurity incidents are happening more often and with increasingly severe consequences. We may be required to expend substantial additional resources to augment our efforts to address potential cybersecurity risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and which may not be successful.\nIf any of these events were to occur, they could disrupt our operations, distract our management, cause us to lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers, as well as subject us to regulatory actions, litigation, fines, damage to our reputation or competitive position, or orders or decrees requiring us to modify our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe have at times experienced significant fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations from one quarter to the next. Our future net sales and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that our net sales or results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the market price of our common stock could fall significantly. Our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our mobile connectivity and inertial navigation products and services, including as a result of our AgilePlans;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of individual orders from military customers, which may be delayed or canceled for various reasons;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products and services we sell, including the mix of fixed rate and metered contracts for airtime services;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture, test and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, including the availability and timely delivery of components and subassemblies from our suppliers;\n\u2022\nour success in winning competitions for orders;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe scope and success of our investments in research and development;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in pursuing acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in expanding, maintaining, or improving our mini-VSAT Broadband network;\n\u2022\nmarket and competitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nunanticipated charges or expenses, such as increases in warranty claims;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic climate; and\n\u2022\nseasonality of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage.\nIn light of our current and anticipated investments in research and development and the expansion of our HTS network, we expect that our operating expenses in upcoming quarters will increase significantly over the amounts we incurred in prior comparable quarters.\nA large portion of our expenses, including expenses for network infrastructure, facilities, equipment, and personnel, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, if our net sales decline or do not grow as much or as quickly as we anticipate, we might be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins. Any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur stock price has historically been volatile. During the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, the trading price of our common stock ranged from $8.64 to $14.15. Many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanging needs of military customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe hiring or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industries; and\n\u2022\nthe global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\nIn addition, the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Major stock market indices experienced dramatic declines in 2008, the first quarter of 2009, January 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2018. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company\u2019s stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities litigation against that company. Any such litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses defending against the claim, divert the time and attention of our management and result in significant damages.\nThe timing and amount of any repurchases under our recently announced share repurchase program are uncertain.\nIn October 2019, we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to 1,000,000 shares, or approximately 5.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock at that time. We currently expect that share repurchases under the program will be funded with cash on hand. The volume and timing of any such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of shares, price, market conditions, alternative uses of capital, liquidity, general business conditions, satisfaction of debt covenants, and applicable regulatory requirements. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any minimum number or dollar amount of shares, and the program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. Any repurchases may reduce the public float of shares available for trading on a daily basis, which could reduce our liquidity and lead to greater volatility in our stock price. The existence of the program may cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be, and any discontinuation or reduction of the program could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. As of December 31, 2019, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $0.5 million.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years.\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Act. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.\nThe 2017 Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits, and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. The 2017 Tax Act also transitions taxation of earnings from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which subjects certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. Both recently issued and future U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. In addition, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the application of many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and related U.S. Treasury regulations, and the positions we take may later be challenged by tax authorities, which could lead to additional taxes, penalties and interest and, if material, might require us to revise or restate our consolidated financial statements. Moreover, the 2017 Tax Act and related regulations and interpretations require us to perform new, complex computations, make significant judgments and estimates, and prepare and analyze information not previously relevant or regularly produced. Our information management systems and related processes may require modifications in order to collect and process necessary information. We may be unable to make necessary modifications in a timely or effective manner, which could result in the miscalculation of our tax obligations.\nIn June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 U.S. tax court decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner. The court\u2019s opinion upheld U.S. Treasury regulations requiring the inclusion of stock-based compensation costs under cost-sharing agreements. Based on our preliminary analysis, we believe the impact of the court\u2019s decision would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, additional changes to precedent or applicable law on this point could impact our financial statements or operations.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries. On October 5, 2015, the OECD issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. Many of these recommendations or similar concepts are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the 2017 Tax Act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.\nChanges in the competitive environment, supply chain issues, and the transition to out HTS network may require inventory write-downs.\nFrom time to time, we have recorded significant inventory charges and/or inventory write-offs as a result of substantial declines in customer demand. For example, in 2019, we recorded a $2.3 million inventory reserve relating to our TracPhone V-IP products as we decided to no longer promote sales of these products but instead to focus our efforts on migrating customers to our HTS network and products. Market or competitive changes could lead to future charges for excess or obsolete inventory, especially if we are unable to appropriately adjust the supply of material from our vendors.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions of other businesses become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded, and may continue to record, a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against earnings, which could materially reduce our reported results of operations in future periods.\nOur charter and by-laws and Delaware law may deter takeovers.\nOur certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive. These provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions, including the election of directors. These provisions relate to:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, and determine its terms, without a stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nthe classification of our Board of Directors, which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe limitation that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition against stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.", "PERMNO": 83390, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "KVHI"}
