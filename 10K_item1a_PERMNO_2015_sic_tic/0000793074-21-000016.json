RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results, business, financial condition and cash flows to materially differ from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements made herein because such statements speak only to the date they were made. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we undertake no obligation or duty to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events. Also refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur business is subject to overall economic conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes, industry freight demand and industry truck capacity. When shipping volumes decline or available truck capacity increases, freight pricing generally becomes more competitive as carriers compete for loads to maintain truck productivity. We may be negatively affected by future economic conditions including employment levels, business conditions, fuel and energy costs, public health crises, interest rates and tax rates. Economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of our customers, resulting in a greater risk of bad debt losses, and that of our suppliers, which may affect negotiated pricing or availability of needed goods and services.\nDifficulty in recruiting and retaining experienced drivers, recent driver training school graduates and independent contractors impacts our results of operations.\nAt times, the trucking industry has experienced driver shortages. Driver availability may be affected by changing workforce demographics, alternative employment opportunities, national unemployment rates, freight market conditions, availability of financial aid for driver training schools and changing industry regulations. If such a shortage were to occur and additional driver pay rate increases were necessary to attract and retain drivers, our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in idled equipment, which would affect our profitability and would limit growth opportunities.\nIndependent contractor availability may also be affected by both inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and the availability of equipment financing. On-going federal and state legislative challenges to the independent contractor model could also affect independent contractor availability. In recent years, the topic of the classification of individuals as employees or independent contractors has gained increased attention among federal and state\nregulators as well as the plaintiffs\u2019 bar. Various legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced at the federal and state levels that may affect the classification status of individuals as independent contractors or employees for either employment tax purposes (e.g., withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other benefits available to employees (e.g., workers\u2019 compensation benefits and minimum wage). Recently, certain states (most prominently, California) have seen significant increased activity by tax and other regulators and numerous class action lawsuits filed against transportation companies that engage independent contractors. Potential changes, if any, that could impact the legal classification of the independent contractor relationship between us and our independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to recruit and retain independent contractors. If a shortage of independent contractors occurs, additional increases in per-mile settlement rates (for independent contractors) and driver pay rates (for company drivers) may become necessary to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers. These increases would negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would be unable to obtain corresponding freight rate increases.\nMoreover, class action litigation in this area against other transportation companies has resulted in significant damage awards and/or monetary settlements for workers who have been allegedly misclassified as independent contractors.\nIncreases in fuel prices and shortages of fuel can have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and profitability.\nTo lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins, we have fuel surcharge programs with our customers. These programs generally enable us to recover a majority, but not all, of the fuel price increases. Fuel prices that change rapidly in short time periods also impact our recovery because the surcharge rate in most programs only changes once per week. Fuel shortages, increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing could have a material adverse impact on our operations and profitability. To the extent that we cannot recover the higher cost of fuel through customer fuel surcharges, our financial results would be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2020, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which may limit growth opportunities and reduce profitability.\nThe freight transportation industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking and non-asset-based logistics companies. We compete primarily with other truckload carriers in our TTS segment. Logistics companies, digital brokers, intermodal companies, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers and private carriers also provide a lesser degree of competition in our TTS segment, but such providers are more direct competitors in our Werner Logistics segment. Competition for the freight we transport or manage is based primarily on service, efficiency, available capacity and, to some degree, on freight rates alone. This competition could have an adverse effect on either the number of shipments we transport or the freight rates we receive, which could limit our growth opportunities and reduce our profitability.\nThe seasonal pattern generally experienced in the trucking industry may affect our periodic results during traditionally slower shipping periods and winter months.\nIn the trucking industry, revenues generally follow a seasonal pattern which may affect our results of operations. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, our freight volumes are typically lower because some customers reduce shipment levels. Our operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months because of cold temperatures and other adverse winter weather conditions which result in decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs. Revenue can also be affected by adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers.\nWe depend on key customers, the loss or financial failure of which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from key customers. During 2020, our largest 5, 10, 25 and 50 customers accounted for 36%, 49%, 67%, and 79% of revenues, respectively. Our largest customer, Dollar General, accounted for 12% of the our total revenues in 2020. We do not have long-term contractual relationships with many of our key One-Way Truckload customers. Most of our Dedicated customer contracts are two to five years in length and generally may be terminated by either party typically upon 90 days or more notice following the expiration of the contract\u2019s first year. We typically renegotiate rates with our customers for these Dedicated contracts annually. We cannot provide any assurance that key customer relationships will continue at the same levels. If a key customer substantially reduced or terminated our services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We review our customers\u2019 financial conditions for granting credit, monitor changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions on an ongoing basis and review individual past-due balances and collection concerns. However, a key customer\u2019s financial failure may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of third-party capacity providers, the availability of which could affect our profitability and limit growth in our Werner Logistics segment.\nOur Werner Logistics segment is highly dependent on the services of third-party capacity providers, such as other truckload carriers, less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, ocean carriers and airlines. Many of those providers face the same economic challenges as we do and therefore are actively and competitively soliciting business. These economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the availability and cost of third-party capacity. If we are unable to secure the services of these third-party capacity providers at reasonable rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot effectively manage the challenges associated with doing business internationally, our revenues and profitability may suffer.\nOur results are affected by the success of our operations in Mexico, China and other foreign countries in which we operate (see Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K). We are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in the economic strength of the countries in which we do business, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States export and import laws, and social, political, and economic instability. Additional risks associated with our foreign operations, including restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties by foreign governments, are present but have been largely mitigated by the terms of NAFTA for Mexico and Canada. The United States, Canada and Mexico ratified the USMCA as an overhaul and update to NAFTA, and it became effective in July 2020. We believe we are one of the largest truckload carriers in terms of freight volume shipped to and from the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It is currently difficult for Werner to anticipate the full impact of this agreement on foreign trade and our Mexico operations. The agreement permitting cross border movements for both United States and Mexican based carriers into the United States and Mexico presents additional risks in the form of potential increased competition and the potential for increased congestion on the cross border lanes between countries.\nWe rely on the services of key personnel, the loss of which could impact our future success.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of key personnel, including our executive officers. Although we believe we have an experienced and highly qualified management team, the loss of the services of these key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and our future profitability.\nDifficulty in obtaining goods and services from our vendors and suppliers could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our vendors and suppliers. We believe we have good vendor relationships and that we are generally able to obtain favorable pricing and other terms from vendors and suppliers. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with our vendors and suppliers, or if our vendors and suppliers experience significant financial problems, we could experience difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of production interruptions or other reasons. Consequently, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe use our information systems extensively for day-to-day operations, and service interruptions or a failure of our information technology infrastructure or a breach of our information security systems, networks or processes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the stability, availability and security of our information systems to manage our business. Much of our software was developed internally or by adapting purchased software applications to suit our needs. Our information systems are used for planning loads, communicating with and dispatching drivers and other capacity providers, billing customers, paying vendors and providing financial reports. We rely on strategic vendors for GPS and satellite communication services, which are integrated in our information systems. If any of our critical information systems fail or become unavailable, or those of our service providers, we would have to perform certain functions manually, which could temporarily affect our ability to efficiently manage our operations. We have redundant computer hardware systems to reduce this risk. We also maintain information security policies to protect our systems and data from cyber security events and threats. The security risks associated with information technology systems have increased in recent years because of the increased sophistication, activities and evolving techniques of perpetrators of cyber attacks. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A failure in or breach of our information technology security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or unauthorized network access could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs and/or cause losses and reputational damage. In addition, recently, there has also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S., and failure to comply with applicable U.S. data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines,\nsanctions or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a slowdown of economic activity and a disruption in supply chains. Our business is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes, industry freight demand and industry truck capacity. Such conditions may also impact the financial condition of our customers, resulting in a greater risk of bad debt losses, and that of our suppliers, which may affect the availability or pricing of needed goods and services. Although we have taken numerous actions to lessen the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our 2021 results could be further impacted by the disruptive effects of COVID-19, including but not limited to adverse effects on freight volumes and pricing and availability of qualified personnel. The degree of disruption is difficult to predict because of many factors, including the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and duration of the pandemic, governmental actions that have been and may continue to be imposed, as well as the rate of economic recovery after the pandemic subsides. The unpredictable nature and uncertainty of the current COVID-19 pandemic could also magnify other risk factors disclosed above and makes it impractical to identify all potential risks.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry. Changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe are regulated by the DOT and its agency the FMCSA in the United States and similar governmental transportation agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. We are also regulated by agencies in certain U.S. states. These regulatory agencies have the authority to govern transportation-related activities, such as safety, authorization to conduct motor carrier operations and other matters. The Regulations subsection in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K describes several proposed and pending regulations that may have a significant effect on our operations including our productivity, driver recruitment and retention and capital expenditures.\nOur operations are subject to applicable environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nIn addition to direct regulation by DOT, FMCSA, EPA and other federal, state, and local agencies, we are subject to applicable environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, aboveground and underground fuel storage tanks, discharge and retention of storm-water, and emissions from our vehicles. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage at some of our facilities. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. Tractors and trailers used in our daily operations have been affected by regulatory changes related to air emissions and fuel efficiency, and may be adversely affected in the future by new regulatory actions.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nOur earnings could be reduced by increases in the number of insurance claims, cost per claim, costs of insurance premiums or availability of insurance coverage.\nWe are self-insured for a significant portion of liability resulting from bodily injury, property damage, cargo and associate workers\u2019 compensation and health benefit claims. This is supplemented by premium-based insurance coverage with insurance carriers above our self-insurance level for each type of coverage. To the extent we experience a significant increase in the number of claims, cost per claim (including costs resulting from large verdicts) or insurance premium costs for coverage in excess of our retention and deductible amounts, our operating results would be negatively affected. Healthcare legislation and inflationary cost increases could also have a negative effect on our results.\nDecreased demand for our used revenue equipment could result in lower unit sales and resale values.\nWe are sensitive to changes in used equipment prices and demand, especially with respect to tractors. We have been in the business of selling our company-owned trucks since 1992, when we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary Werner Fleet Sales.\nReduced demand for used equipment could result in a lower volume of sales or lower sales prices, either of which could negatively affect our proceeds from sales of assets.", "PERMNO": 10397, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "WERN"}
