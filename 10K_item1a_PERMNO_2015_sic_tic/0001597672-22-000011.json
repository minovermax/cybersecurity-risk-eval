{"cik": "1597672", "company": "RAYONIER ADVANCED MATERIALS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity are subject to a number of risks and potential material adverse events including, but not limited to, those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Report and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.\nEpidemic and Pandemic Risks\nWe are subject to risks associated with epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts. The nature and extent of ongoing and future impacts of the pandemic are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic which has generated, and may continue to generate, significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption across the globe including in many markets in which we or our customers do business. Over the past two years, COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and financial condition in various ways, including impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, governments and individual consumers have taken and are continuing to take to limit the spread of the virus, including mandatory closures, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, vaccine programs and mandates and travel and quarantine restrictions. Examples of such impacts have included: increased operating costs due to social distancing and other strict health and safety protocols implemented at our facilities to protect employees and contractors; reductions and/or unpredictable fluctuations in demand; and reduced supply chain reliability due to international shipping congestion associated with global demand surges and fluctuations and empty container imbalances. Impacts could be magnified if the pandemic severity increases or duration persists over an extended period of time. While the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s ongoing and future impacts on our business cannot currently be predicted with certainty, we continue to promote the health and safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers and customers and to closely monitor the pandemic\u2019s impacts on our liquidity, access to capital markets, reliability, customers and suppliers, and the macroeconomic conditions relevant to our business, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates and recessionary pressures.\nSpecific risks associated with COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Significant and unpredictable reductions and other fluctuations in demand for certain of our products due to pandemic-driven factors such as end-market weakness and customer security-of-supply concerns.\n\u2022Adverse effects on our suppliers, vendors and other global supply chain partners which have impaired and could continue to impair our ability to timely and efficiently move our products through the various steps in the global supply chain process to our end customers.\n\u2022Possible workforce disruption to the extent our operational, management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by COVID-19 or fail to comply with applicable vaccination mandates or programs and are not available to perform their duties and tasks, which could create reductions or suspensions of our manufacturing operations and other support functions.\n\u2022Restricted access to capital, increased financing costs and/or adverse effects on our liquidity and perceptions of our creditworthiness due to the ongoing adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and capital markets worldwide.\n\u2022Possible heightening of other risks described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this Report to the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe businesses we operate are highly competitive and many of them are cyclical, which may result in fluctuations in pricing and volume that can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition, demand fluctuations and cyclicality are the most significant drivers of sales volumes and pricing for our products. We face significant competition from domestic and foreign producers in virtually all of our businesses. For example, in our cellulose specialties product line, increased cellulose specialties production capacity from our competitors, some of whom have lower raw material, wood and production costs than us, combined with demand weakness, have collectively contributed to substantially lower cellulose specialties sales prices over the past several years. Likewise, volumes have declined meaningfully in recent years due to these factors. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these dynamics and may continue to do so. Our high-purity commodity products for viscose and absorbent materials applications are also highly cyclical, and in 2019 and 2020 were at extremely low pricing levels. While these levels began to slowly rebound during the latter part of 2020 and continued to increase throughout 2021, there can be no assurance as to the extent of such rebound or that elevated levels will be sustained over a significant period of time.\nWith respect to demand for cellulose specialties, and in particular our acetate grades, the majority of these acetate grades are used to manufacture acetate tow, which is used to make the filter component of a cigarette. Significant increases in cigarette costs and potential actions taken by the United States and other countries to discourage smoking, such as tax increases on tobacco products, policy changes and future legislation, may have a material adverse effect on the demand for tobacco products. Additionally, increased use of e-cigarettes, electronically heated tobacco products and smokeless tobacco products, by way of example, may affect demand for traditional cigarettes.\nIn addition, some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as publishing, packaging, automotive and textiles, are cyclical in nature, thus posing risks to us which are beyond our control. These industries are highly competitive and may experience overcapacity and reductions in end-use demand, each of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. The consequences of this could include the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders.\nOur paperboard and high yield pulp businesses are highly cyclical and influenced by a variety of factors. These include periods of excess product supply due to industry capacity increases, periods of decreased demand due to reduced economic activity or market conditions, inventory de-stocking by customers and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These factors may cause significant price changes over a short period, such as fluctuations experienced over the past two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address these factors, we have in the past, and may in the future, elect to schedule production curtailments and shutdowns to address, for example, unfavorable economic conditions, reduced demand for our products or the end products of our customers, lack of economically viable fiber in Canada, reduced market prices and other factors. In particular, our high yield pulp business has been the subject of temporary curtailments at given points over the past two years in reaction to market conditions.\nGiven broader inflation in the economy, we are monitoring the risk inflation presents to active and future contracts. To date we have seen broad based increases in costs from inflation that are material to our business as a whole; however, if we experience greater than expected supply chain and labor inflation, our profits and margins under our contracts could be materially adversely affected.\nIn sum, continued competitive pressures and demand weakness, as well as the cyclicality of our commodity businesses, may have a material adverse impact on our future sales prices and volumes and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in raw material and energy availability and prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRaw material and energy costs, such as chemicals, oil and natural gas and electricity are a significant operating expense. The cost of these inputs can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control, such as lack of availability, changing economic and weather conditions, political, civil or other unrest or instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, caustic soda, a key manufacturing input in our high purity cellulose business, has historically had significant price volatility. Similarly, the price of oil and natural gas (including its pipeline transportation element) is subject to fluctuations based on market demand and other factors. Additionally, we experienced significant price volatility in various chemicals during 2021 driven by weather events in the southeastern United States which substantially impacted supply. In contracts for certain of our products, pricing is set annually or otherwise not subject to change for a contractually-agreed period of time; so in some cases we may have limited ability to pass along fluctuations in these input costs once the contract price for the relevant\nperiod has been established. In addition, industrial and other policies of the governments and governmental agencies having jurisdiction over suppliers of raw materials to our facilities may change, due to changes in political leadership or otherwise, which also could adversely impact the cost of energy and its transportation. While we often use various strategies to mitigate the potential impact of this pricing volatility, such as long term contracting and the purchase of derivative commodity contracts, the impact of raw material and energy pricing increases could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to material risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nWe have large manufacturing operations in Canada and France, and a significant portion of our sales are to customers and customer locations outside of the United States, including China, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Canada and other international markets. Sales to customers outside of the United States made up approximately 66 percent of our revenue in 2021. The manufacture and sale of our products in non-U.S. markets results in risks that are inherent in conducting business under international laws, regulations and customs. We expect international sales will continue to contribute significantly to our results of operations, financial condition and future growth. The risks associated with our business outside the United States include:\n\u2022maintaining and governing international subsidiaries and managing international operations;\n\u2022complying with changes in and reinterpretations of the laws, regulations and enforcement priorities of the countries in which we manufacture and sell our products;\n\u2022complying with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements, as discussed below in more detail;\n\u2022complying with data privacy laws such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR);\n\u2022repatriating cash from foreign countries to the United States;\n\u2022changes in tax laws and their interpretations in the countries in which we do business, including the potential impact on the value of recorded or future deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022product damage or losses incurred during shipping;\n\u2022political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022economic instability, inflation, recessions and interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, as discussed below in more detail;\n\u2022uncertainties regarding non-U.S. judicial systems, rules and procedures; and\n\u2022minimal or limited protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nThese and other risks of doing business outside of the United States could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrency fluctuations may have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada and France. We also sell our products all over the world, in either U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, and our earnings are affected by increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar and in the value of the Canadian dollar and Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. For example, a strengthening U.S. dollar or a weakening home currency of the countries in which certain of our international competitors manufacture products can adversely impact our competitive position versus these competitors. In addition to ordinary course currency fluctuations, specific events have had, and could in the future have, an impact on currency valuation. Our risk management policy allows management, with oversight from the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, to hedge a significant portion of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, though no hedges are currently in place. To accomplish this, we have used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative instruments, such as currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, but there can be no assurance that we will be\nprotected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations or that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on trade through tariffs, countervailing and anti-dumping duties, quotas and other trade barriers, in the United States and internationally, could materially adversely affect our ability to access certain markets.\nWe manufacture our products in the United States, Canada and France, and sell them into more than 40 countries. Our financial results are highly dependent on our ability to sell our products globally. Trade barriers such as tariffs, countervailing and anti-dumping duties, quotas and similar restrictions on trade have in the past, and could in the future, result in materially reduced revenues and profitability. Examples of the effects of such restrictions on trade and tariffs on our business in China and Canada are set forth below.\nChina\nIn 2021, we had total sales of $296 million of products shipped to customers in China and, of this amount, $217 million were of products manufactured in the United States. Trade tensions and trade-related actions, such as tariffs and duties, between China and the U.S. have impacted our business and our customers\u2019 businesses and could do so in the future. Failure of the U.S. and Chinese governments to reach acceptable agreements regarding trade, as well as continued trade volatility and additional trade-related actions by the Chinese government, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCanada\nUntil August 2021, we operated six softwood lumber mills in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, and for several years sold softwood lumber into the United States from Canada. The United States and Canada have a history dating to the early 1980s of trade disputes relating to the export of softwood lumber from Canada into the United States. Each dispute has been resolved via agreement or litigation, which generally involved some combination of duties and/or quotas as well as a return of all or most of the duties previously paid by Canadian softwood lumber producers. In October 2015, a ten-year Softwood Lumber Agreement (the \u201cSLA\u201d) between the United States and Canada, which resolved the 2001-2006 lumber dispute between the countries, expired. No agreement was reached to extend or renew it, and as a result, after a one-year cooling-off period the United States commenced a dumping investigation of lumber exports from Canada into the U.S. In 2017, anti-dumping and countervailing duties were assessed by the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cUSDOC\u201d) on lumber exported into the United States, we were assigned an anti-dumping duty rate of six percent and a countervailing duty rate of 14 percent. These duties are being legally challenged by Canada under both the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) dispute resolution processes. In December 2020, following its administrative review of the period of April 28, 2017 through December 31, 2018, the USDOC determined revised rates for antidumping and countervailing duties, and we are now subject to an anti-dumping duty rate of 1.57 percent and a countervailing duty rate of 7.42 percent. Canada has filed an appeal under Chapter 10 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on Trade (USMCA) to contest these revised duties. As part of the sale of our lumber assets in August 2021, we retain all rights and obligations to softwood lumber duties, generated or incurred through the closing date of the transaction. We paid approximately $112 million in lumber duties through the date of the sale of our lumber assets and we expect to eventually receive a refund for most of these duties in the event of a favorable ruling under the NAFTA or WTO process or a settlement of the dispute. No assurances can be given that the duties will be overturned or repaid through the legal process or a negotiated settlement, or that lumber pricing will be sufficient to substantially offset their impact.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur ten largest customers represent approximately 36 percent of our 2021 revenue, and the loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenue from these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we are not dependent on any single customer or group of customers, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 36 percent of revenue in 2021. Due to the highly competitive nature of our businesses, we regularly bid for new business and to retain/renew existing business and, as such, we are subject to the potential for meaningful revenue and volume gains and losses.\nWe are also subject to credit risk associated with these customers. If one or more of our ten largest customers were to become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for our products, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we continue to strive to broaden and diversify our customer base, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from these ten customers, and the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to any of these customers, or significant, unfavorable changes to pricing or terms contained in contracts with them, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 20 - Segment and Geographical Information of our consolidated financial statements for more information on our major customers.\nA material disruption at one of our major manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and profitability, increase our cost of production and capital needs, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAny of our major manufacturing facilities, or a significant portion of any of these facilities, could cease operations unexpectedly or suffer a material disruption to all or a portion of its operations due to a number of material adverse events, including:\n\u2022unscheduled outages or downtime due to the need for unexpected maintenance or equipment failure, such as for portions of our facilities that produce steam and electricity (such as boilers and turbines), pollution control equipment and equipment directly used to manufacture our products, such as reliability issues during the first quarter of 2019 at the Temiscaming, Quebec plant and during the third quarter of 2021 at the Jesup, Georgia plant;\n\u2022prolonged power interruptions or failures;\n\u2022explosion of boilers or other pressure vessels;\n\u2022interruptions in the supply of raw materials, including chemicals and wood fiber;\n\u2022disruptions to or failures of the transportation infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels, as well as lack of availability of rail, trucking and ocean shipping equipment and service from third party transportation providers;\n\u2022interruption or material reduction of water supply;\n\u2022a chemical spill or release or other event causing impacts to the environment or human health and safety;\n\u2022information technology system failures and cybersecurity incidents causing systems to be inaccessible or unusable;\n\u2022natural disasters (including those as a result of climate change), including fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other similar catastrophes, such as the hurricanes which impacted our Jesup, Georgia and Fernandina Beach, Florida plants in 2017;\n\u2022labor interruptions, such as strikes and short duration walk-outs such as the walk-outs in 2019 and 2021 at our plant in Tartas, France;\n\u2022terrorism or threats of terrorism; and\n\u2022other operational problems resulting from these and other risks.\nSome of these matters are discussed in more detail in other sections of this Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Report. Depending on the nature, extent and length of any operational interruption, the event could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we could incur significant costs to improve the climate-related resiliency of our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the effects of climate change.\nThe availability of, and prices for, wood fiber may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWood fiber is the single largest raw material in the manufacturing process for virtually all of our products. Many factors can impact its availability and pricing. Fiber for our U.S. and French facilities is primarily harvested from privately-held lands, while fiber for our Canadian facilities is primarily harvested from lands owned or controlled by the governments of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, referred to as \u201cCrown lands\u201d. In August 2021, we transferred agreements with provincial authorities, which granted timber \u201ctenures\u201d for terms varying from five to 20 years, to a third party in connection with the sale of the lumber and newsprint assets. Concurrently with the transaction, we entered into a\n20-year wood chip and residual fiber supply agreement with the buyer of those assets, securing supply for our operations at the Temiscaming plant. There can be no assurance that, upon termination of this wood chip and residual fiber supply agreement (for any reason whether due to its natural expiration or otherwise), this agreement will be renewed, extended or replaced in the future on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRegulatory developments and environmental litigation also have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest from non-Crown lands in Canada and privately-owned lands in the U.S. and France, thereby increasing prices for these sources of wood fiber. In Canada, for example, future legislation and policy changes, litigation advanced by environmental groups and Indigenous communities concerning rights and limitations on harvesting and use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest diversity, control over insect and disease infestations, and the response to and prevention of wildfires could also affect wood fiber supply, pricing and availability.\nIn addition, much of the wood fiber we use is sourced by or from third party contractors who harvest, chip and/or transport the fiber to our manufacturing facilities, either as logs for lumber and chipping or as chips. Another key factor in fiber supply and pricing is the availability of experienced logging and fiber transportation contractors in the areas in which our manufacturing facilities are located. Sourcing fiber from greater distances from our facilities due to unavailability of more proximally located fiber sources could also impact pricing due to additional transportation cost. Significant reduction in the availability of contractors experienced in harvesting and transporting logs could also impact wood fiber supply, pricing and availability.\nFinally, natural conditions, such as weather, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access to timberlands for harvesting (for example, due to prolonged wet or cold conditions) may also limit the availability, and increase the price, of wood, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters (including those as a result of climate change) such as wind storms and hurricanes. Additionally, we experienced significant price volatility in various chemicals during 2021 driven by weather events in the southeastern United States which substantially impacted supply. It is unclear whether these conditions will persist into the future.\nIn sum, any sustained decrease in harvestable lands or wood supply, or increase in fiber prices, whether sourced from Crown lands in Canada or from private parties in Canada, the U.S. or France, changes in the logging and transportation supply base, or significant changes to historically customary natural conditions, could materially increase our costs and thereby materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations require substantial capital.\nWe operate capital intensive businesses and require substantial capital for ongoing maintenance, repair and replacement of existing facilities and equipment. Although we endeavor to maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment and systems, some of which are large in scale, may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new or existing environmental regulations at times require additional capital expenditures for compliance. We believe our capital resources are currently adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. However, if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on reasonable economic terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on transportation services provided by third parties, both domestically and internationally. We rely on these providers for transportation of the products we manufacture as well as delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities. A significant portion of the products we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks, and by ship.\nIf any of our transportation providers fail to deliver the goods we manufacture in a timely manner, or damage them during transport, we may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely manufacture our products in response to\ncustomer demand. In addition, the cost of energy, and specifically fuel, may adversely impact the cost of transporting our products. Finally, if any of the ports we commonly use for international shipping, or the port system generally, suffer work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, our business could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 72 percent of our global work force is unionized. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms of employment with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if labor negotiations result in substantially higher compensation costs or materially restrict how we run our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these labor unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. While we do not expect any labor interruptions of significant duration, if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage (such as the short-duration walk-outs in 2019 and 2021 at our plant in Tartas, France) at one or more of our major facilities, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel, the loss of whom could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe believe our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in the loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. Furthermore, some of our facilities are in relatively remote locations, which can adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain employees. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time in recent years and has recently intensified further due to industry trends, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet. Our failure to develop and retain key personnel and recruit and develop qualified replacements for retiring or other departing employees could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and priorities.\nFailure to develop new products or discover new applications for our existing products, or our inability to protect the intellectual property underlying such new products or applications, could have a material negative impact on our business.\nWe have an active research and development program to develop new products and new applications for our existing products. However, there can be no assurance this program will be successful, either from a product development or commercialization perspective, or that any particular invention, product or development, or the program as a whole, will lead to significant revenue or profit generation. Moreover, some of our new products and new applications may not contain intellectual property that can be protected under intellectual property laws. Failure to generate meaningful revenue and profit from our research and product development efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nThe risk of loss of the Company\u2019s intellectual property and sensitive data, or disruption of its manufacturing operations, in each case due to cyberattacks or cybersecurity breaches, could materially adversely impact the Company.\nLike most companies, we have been, and expect in the future to continue to be, subject to attempted cyberattacks. Such attacks could include, for example, the increasingly prevalent practice of cyber extortion through the deployment of ransomware. Cyberattacks or cybersecurity breaches could compromise our intellectual property and confidential business information, cause a disruption to our operations, or harm our reputation. Moreover, the recent pandemic-driven increase in remote working and virtual interactions has only served to expand our \u201cattack surface\u201d. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient operation of our business. This role includes ordering and managing equipment, parts and raw materials from suppliers, managing inventory, managing the processes we use to produce finished products, facilitating order entry and fulfillment and processing of transactions, summarizing and reporting financial results, facilitating internal and external communications, administering human resources functions, retaining certain personal information and providing other processes necessary to manage our business. While we have implemented and maintain what we believe to be appropriate\ncybersecurity policies, programs, controls and systems, there can be no assurance a cyberattack would not be successful, or that such a cybersecurity breach will not occur. Such an event could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur business is subject to extensive environmental laws, regulations and permits that may materially restrict or adversely affect how we conduct business and our financial results.\nOur plants are subject to environmental laws, regulations and permits that may require significant capital to enable our compliance, or which could limit our operations and production. Many of our operations are subject to environmental laws, regulations and permits that contain stringent conditions governing how we operate our facilities, including how much and, in some cases, what types of products, we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may materially adversely restrict our current production, limit our ability to increase production and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, compliance-related capital and operating costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become stricter, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.\nEnvironmental laws, regulations and permits are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations, permits and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change, and new laws and regulations are frequently enacted. These laws and regulations may limit, prohibit or affect, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, receiving water quality, water withdrawal, remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater, and the type of chemicals we use in our manufacturing processes. Over time, the complexity and restrictions imposed by these laws and regulations have increased and regulatory enforcement efforts have intensified. Environmental regulatory authorities have pursued a number of initiatives which, if implemented, could impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like ours, especially in the area of air emissions, wastewater and storm water control. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Regulation of this Report for further information. Environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental groups, Indigenous communities (in Canada) and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of our operations. We expect that environmental groups, Indigenous communities and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in areas where we operate plants. Generally, environmental permitting programs in all areas where we operate include provisions for public and stakeholder engagement for both renewal of existing permits and approvals for expansions or modifications of our manufacturing operations. In Canada, direct consultation with Indigenous communities may also be required. Delays, restrictions and increased costs caused by the intervention of these groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in permit proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. For example, in March 2014, litigation was commenced in federal court by the Altamaha Riverkeeper (\u201cARK\u201d) alleging violations of federal and state environmental laws relating to permitted wastewater discharges from our plant in Jesup, Georgia (although it was dismissed by the court on summary judgment in 2015), and in January of 2016 the same group brought an action in the Georgia Office of Administrative Hearings against the Georgia Environmental Protection Division of the Natural Resources (the \u201cEPD\u201d) in opposition to the issuance by the EPD of a renewed wastewater treatment permit for our Jesup plant. While these proceedings have, to date, been decided largely in our favor, we would expect similar attempts at legal intervention to be made in the future.\nWe currently own or may acquire properties that require environmental remediation or otherwise are subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or may acquire in the future, properties which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other liabilities, and we may have such liabilities at properties, such as formerly operated manufacturing facilities, that we do not currently own. The cost of assessment and remediation of contaminated properties could be substantial and materially adversely affect our financial results. These costs could include, without limitation, costs of investigation and assessment, corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment and other remediation and closure costs, as well as resolution of third-party\nclaims for property damage and personal injury as a result of alleged violations of, or liabilities arising out of, environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe we currently have adequate liabilities recorded, legal requirements relating to assessment and remediation of contaminated properties continue to become more stringent and there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed current liabilities and forecasts, or that other presently unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Regulation of this Report and Note 10 - Environmental Liabilities of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe potential longer-term impacts of climate-related risks remain uncertain at this time.\nClimate change and its impacts on people and our planet continues to be a topic of significant focus and attention to our customers, investors and various other stakeholders. Based on currently available information, we do not expect climate-related issues or associated expenditures to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in fiscal 2022 or over the next several years, but we can give no assurance that expenditures will not exceed current expectations, and such expenditures may increase in future years. Additional information regarding climate change and the Company is available in our 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance Report (\u201cESG Report\u201d) which can be found on our website at www.rayonieram.com.

The information contained in our ESG Report is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Any targets or goals with respect to matters discussed herein or in our ESG Report are forward-looking statements and may be aspirational. These targets or goals are not guarantees of future results and involve assumptions and known and unknown risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe Company considers and evaluates climate-related risks in three general categories: Regulatory; Transition to a low-carbon economy; and Physical risks related to climate-change.\nRegulatory. There are numerous international, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the United States, Canada and France, where we have operations, most of these initiatives and proposals would, or currently do, regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more \u201cclean energy.\u201d Initiatives that materially impact purchased electricity prices could increase our manufacturing costs, especially in our Canadian operations, because our operations in Canada use more purchased electricity (on a percentage basis) than our U.S. facilities. In addition, the federal government of Canada has indicated its intent to regulate priority air pollutants and GHGs under the Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Under the proposed regulatory targets, our Canadian pulp and paper mills may be required to reduce air pollutants, such as particulate matter (\u201cPM\u201d), sulphur oxides (\u201cSOx\u201d) emissions, nitrogen oxides (\u201cNOx\u201d) and GHGs. While industry consultations are ongoing with the federal government, the cost of making any such reductions is currently unknown; however, the requirements associated with PM, SOx and NOx are not expected to be material to us given our current operations and pollution control systems.\nThe federal government of Canada has adopted the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act which implements the federal carbon pollution pricing system. Under the provisions of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, the provinces, who have implemented their own carbon pollution price, or a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system, will not be subject to the federal program provided their program meets the minimum federal pricing and emissions reduction targets. Quebec implemented a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d program for GHGs which meets the minimum criteria. Our Temiscaming plant in Qu\u00e9bec was a net purchaser of credits under these programs in 2021. To date, the cost of GHG credits under cap-and-trade programs purchased by our business and incorporated into the overall cost of our purchased wood fiber has not been material, though no assurances can be given that they will not substantially increase in the future because the future state of the law and the cost of GHG credits in applicable jurisdictions is currently not known.\nTransition. The transition to a low carbon economy, as predicted by many investors and other stakeholders, poses both risks and opportunities for us that are, as yet, not quantified. Similar to other manufacturers in our industry, we use biomass, natural gas, liquid fossil fuels and purchased electricity to power our plants. Changes in policy, regulation or technology related to fuels that we, or our electricity providers, use could materially increase our costs. Additionally, customers continue to express a desire for certified material and improvements in sustainable performance.\nAt the same time, our main product lines (cellulose specialties and viscose grade commodity dissolving wood pulps) as well as all of our other products, are made from wood as their primary raw material, which is a renewable, natural raw material. In addition, our cellulose specialty products are natural polymers that potentially can be used as an effective, more climate-friendly substitute for certain applications which currently use fossil fuel-based products. However, these opportunities, as well as their attendant risks, including for our new 2G bioethanol project in Tartas, France, are not fully known or understood at this time.\nPhysical. The potential impacts of extreme weather which could result from the impacts of climate change, such as hurricanes, blizzards, and heavy rain, are factored into our enterprise risk assessment process and the mitigation measures we currently take to protect our assets and business. It is not clear whether increased frequency of these or similar events would materially change our risk profile, analyses or mitigation measures, but there can be no assurance that they would not require additional expenditures which could be material.\nIn sum, additional business and regulatory initiatives may be implemented to address GHG emissions and other climate-change-related concerns. If such initiatives are implemented, we may be required to incur additional capital expenditures, increased operating costs for wood fiber or raw materials, and/or mitigating expenses, such as carbon taxes or other charges, to address and comply with any such initiatives. No assurance can be given that the increased costs associated with compliance of future GHG-related requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe may need to make significant additional cash contributions to our retirement benefit plans if investment returns on pension assets are lower than expected or interest rates decline, and/or due to changes to regulatory, accounting and actuarial requirements.\nWe have a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers many of our salaried and hourly employees in the United States. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these benefit plans. Our non-U.S. pension plans, while currently adequately funded, will also require periodic contributions to ensure that applicable legal requirements are met. Because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. In addition, it is possible new or additional accounting rules and changes to actuarial requirements (for example, if life expectancy assumptions for participants are increased) may also result in the need for additional contributions to the plans. Any such contributions could materially adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates of this Report for additional information about these plans, including funding status.\nWe have debt obligations that could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total combined indebtedness was approximately $0.9 billion. This significant amount of debt could have material adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be used for interest payments on this debt;\n\u2022making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\n\u2022increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, market or other changes in our businesses and industry;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt;\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022limiting access to liquidity, including through our variable interest asset-based revolving credit facility.\nTo the extent we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt. See Note 9 - Debt and Finance Leases in our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt obligations.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark in 2023 may impact our borrowing costs.\nThe reporting of financial information used to determine LIBOR is scheduled to be phased out beginning in 2023. As of December 31, 2021, we had no indebtedness outstanding with interest payment terms based on LIBOR. However, under the terms of our asset-based revolving credit facility, loans are subject to LIBOR or a comparable or successor widely-published alternative rate designated by the administrative agent. We have not yet been advised by the administrative agent of its selected alternative rate, and although the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is expected to be the alternative rate that replaces LIBOR, we cannot predict what margin adjustments and related terms would be negotiated with our loan counterparties. As a result, our interest expense could increase. While we do not believe that a change from LIBOR to an alternative rate will have a material adverse impact on our borrowing costs or ability to access capital, no assurances relating to the potential impact can be provided at this time.\nChallenges in the commercial and credit environments may materially adversely affect our future access to capital.\nOur ability to issue debt or equity or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be materially adversely affected if there continues to be a material decline in the pricing or sales volume for our products, or if significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions occur. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing or other costs of capital or affect our ability to gain access to the capital markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities, make strategic investments in our facilities or require funding to invest in joint ventures or make acquisitions. We may be unable to obtain desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including but not limited to extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital and/or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund growth opportunities, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, the terms of such debt may subject us to limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants in addition to those that are expected to be in place pursuant to our existing indebtedness.\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock and Certain Corporate Matters Risks\nYour percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or other corporate purposes, including equity awards we will grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have options to purchase shares of our common stock, and we anticipate our compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to our employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, could prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could issue preferred stock and grant the holders thereof the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nMerger and Acquisition Risks\nWe closed on the sale of the lumber and newsprint facilities and related assets to GreenFirst on August 28, 2021; Fifteen percent (15%) of the purchase price for the GreenFirst transaction was paid in the common shares of the capital of GreenFirst (to be held by us for a minimum of six (6) months following the transaction closing) and our ability to ultimately realize the benefit of this consideration is subject to market conditions and GreenFirst\u2019s future performance.", "PERMNO": 14682, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "RYAM"}
