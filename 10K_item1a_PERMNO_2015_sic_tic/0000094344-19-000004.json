{"cik": "94344", "company": "STEWART INFORMATION SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information presented in this report and our other filings with the SEC, in evaluating our business and any investment in Stewart. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In that event, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline materially.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions, especially those affecting the levels of real estate and mortgage activity, may reduce our revenues.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by changes in economic conditions, particularly mortgage interest rates, credit availability, real estate prices and consumer confidence. Our revenues and earnings have fluctuated in the past due to the cyclical nature of the housing industry and we expect them to fluctuate in the future.\nThe demand for our title insurance-related and mortgage services offerings is dependent primarily on the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions. The volume of these transactions historically has been influenced by such factors as mortgage interest rates, availability of financing and the overall state of the economy. Typically, when interest rates are increasing or when the economy is experiencing a downturn, real estate activity declines. As a result, the title insurance industry tends to experience decreased revenues and earnings. Increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our bond portfolio and the amount of interest we pay on our floating-rate bank debt.\nOur revenues and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by a decline in home prices, real estate activity and the availability of financing alternatives. In addition, weakness or adverse changes in the level of real estate activity could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nOur claims experience may require us to increase our provision for title losses or to record additional reserves, either of which would adversely affect our earnings.\nWe estimate our future loss payments and our assumptions about future losses may prove inaccurate. Provisions for policy losses on policies written within a given year are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized. The amounts provided are based on reported claims, historical loss payment experience, title industry averages and the current legal and economic environment. Losses that are higher than anticipated are an indication that total losses for a given policy year may be higher than originally calculated. Changes in the total estimated future loss for prior policy years are recorded in the period in which the estimate changes. Claims are often complex and involve uncertainties as to the dollar amount and timing of individual payments. Claims are often paid many years after a policy is issued. From time-to-time, we experience large losses, including losses from independent agency defalcations, from title policies that have been issued or worsening loss payment experience, any of which may require us to increase our title loss reserves. These events are unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nCompetition in the title insurance industry may affect our revenues.\nCompetition in the title insurance industry is intense, particularly with respect to price, service and expertise. Larger commercial customers and mortgage originators also look to the size and financial strength of a title insurer. Although we are one of the leading title insurance underwriters based on market share, FNF, Old Republic and First American each has substantially greater revenues than we do and their holding companies have significantly greater capital. Further, the other title insurance companies collectively hold a considerable share of the market. Although we are not aware of any current initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers to entering our industry, any such reduction could result in new competitors, including financial institutions, entering the title insurance business. From time-to-time, new entrants enter the marketplace with alternative products to traditional title insurance, although many of these alternative products have been disallowed by title insurance regulators. Further, advances in technologies could, over time, significantly disrupt the traditional business model of financial services companies, including title insurance. These alternative products or disruptive technologies, if permitted by regulators, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.\nAvailability of credit may reduce our liquidity and negatively impact our ability to fund operations.\nWe expect that cash flows from operations and cash available from our underwriters, subject to regulatory restrictions, will be sufficient to fund our operations, pay our claims and fund operational initiatives. To the extent that these funds are not sufficient, we may be required to borrow funds on less than favorable terms or seek funding from the equity market, which may be on terms that are dilutive to existing shareholders.\nA downgrade of our underwriters by rating agencies may reduce our revenues.\nRatings are a significant component in determining the competitiveness of insurance companies with respect to commercial title policies. Our domestic underwriters, Guaranty and STIC, have historically been highly rated by the rating agencies that cover us. These ratings are not credit ratings. Instead, the ratings are based on quantitative, and in some cases qualitative, information and reflect the conclusions of the rating agencies with respect to our financial strength, results of operations and ability to pay policyholder claims. Our ratings are subject to continual review by the rating agencies, and we cannot be assured that our current ratings will be maintained. If our ratings are downgraded from current levels by the rating agencies, our ability to retain existing customers and develop new customer relationships may be negatively impacted, which could result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiaries must comply with extensive government regulations. These regulations could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and operating results.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is charged with protecting consumers by enforcing Federal consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB is an independent agency and funded by the United States Federal Reserve System. Its jurisdiction includes banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors and other financial companies. The nature and extent of these regulations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nconducting rule-making, supervision, and enforcement of Federal consumer protection laws;\n\u2022\nrestricting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices;\n\u2022\ntaking consumer complaints;\n\u2022\npromoting financial education;\n\u2022\nresearching consumer behavior;\n\u2022\nmonitoring financial markets for new risks to consumers; and\n\u2022\nenforcing laws that outlaw discrimination and other unfair treatment in consumer finance.\nThe CFPB\u2019s integrated disclosure rule for mortgage loan applications, known as \"Know Before You Owe\", imposes certain requirements for us and other mortgage industry participants regarding required mortgage disclosures and forms. Compliance with this integrated disclosure, which was introduced in 2015, has altered related business processes and interactions with customers.\nGovernmental authorities regulate our insurance subsidiaries in the various states and international jurisdictions in which we do business. These regulations generally are intended for the protection of policyholders rather than stockholders. The nature and extent of these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically involve:\n\u2022\napproving or setting of insurance premium rates;\n\u2022\nstandards of solvency and minimum amounts of statutory capital and surplus that must be maintained;\n\u2022\nlimitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u2022\nestablishing reserves, including statutory premium reserves, for losses and loss adjustment expenses;\n\u2022\nregulating underwriting and marketing practices;\n\u2022\nregulating dividend payments and other transactions among affiliates;\n\u2022\nprior approval for the acquisition and control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company;\n\u2022\nlicensing of insurers, agencies and, in certain states, escrow officers;\n\u2022\nregulation of reinsurance;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company;\n\u2022\ndeposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u2022\napproval of policy forms;\n\u2022\nmethods of accounting; and\n\u2022\nfiling of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters.\nThese regulations may impede or impose burdensome conditions on rate increases or other actions that we might want to take to enhance our operating results.\nWe may also be subject to additional state or federal regulations prescribed by legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Act or by regulations issued by the CFPB, Department of Labor, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury or other agencies. Changes in regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, state regulators perform periodic examinations of insurance companies, which could result in increased compliance or litigation expenses.\nRapid changes in our industry require secure, timely and cost-effective technological responses. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively use technology to address regulatory changes and increase productivity.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate changes in the industry and to offer products and services that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost-effective basis. To do so requires a flexible technology architecture which can continuously comply with changing regulations, improve productivity, lower costs, reduce risk and enhance the customer experience. Inability to meet these requirements and any unanticipated downtime in our technology may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe rely on dividends from our insurance underwriting subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and our principal assets are our insurance underwriting subsidiaries. Consequently, we depend on receiving sufficient dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our parent company's operating expenses and dividends to our stockholders. The insurance statutes and regulations of some states require us to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital and restrict the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay to us. Guaranty is a wholly owned subsidiary of Stewart and the principal source of our cash flow. In this regard, the ability of Guaranty to pay dividends to us is dependent on the approval of the Texas Insurance Commissioner. Refer to Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for details on statutory surplus and dividend restrictions.\nClaims by large classes of claimants may impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are periodically involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we are currently, and have been in the past, subject to claims and litigation from large classes of claimants seeking substantial damages not arising in the ordinary course of business. Material pending legal proceedings, if any, not in the ordinary course of business, would be disclosed in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings included elsewhere in this report. To date, the impact of the outcome of these proceedings has not been material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. However, an unfavorable outcome in any litigation, claim or investigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation technology systems present potential targets for cyber security attacks.\nOur operations are reliant on technology. These systems are used to store and process sensitive information regarding our operations, financial position and any information pertaining to our customers and vendors. While we take the utmost precautions, we cannot guarantee safety from all cyber threats, wire fraud and attacks to our systems. Any successful breach of security could result in the spread of inaccurate or confidential information, disruption of operations, theft of escrowed funds, endangerment of employees, damage to our assets and increased costs to respond. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance to protect us financially, there is no assurance that the instances noted above would not have a negative impact on cash flows, litigation status and/or our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic or other business conditions could cause us to record an impairment of all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nWe annually perform an impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter using June 30 balances. However, an evaluation may be made whenever events may indicate an impairment has occurred. In assessing whether an impairment has occurred, we consider whether the performance of our reporting units may be below projections, unexpected declines in our market capitalization, negative macroeconomic trends or negative industry and company-specific trends. If we conclude that the carrying values of these assets exceed the fair value, we may be required to record an impairment of these assets. Any substantial impairment that may be required in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFailures at financial institutions at which we deposit funds could adversely affect us.\nWe deposit substantial operating and fiduciary funds, which are third-party funds, in many financial institutions in excess of insured deposit limits. In the event that one or more of these financial institutions fail, there is no guarantee that we could recover the deposited funds in excess of federal deposit insurance, and, as such, we could be held liable for the funds owned by third parties. Under these circumstances, our liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to interest rate and other risks and could experience losses.\nWe maintain a substantial investment portfolio, primarily consisting of fixed income debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. Our portfolio holdings are subject to certain economic and financial market risks, including credit and interest rate risk and/or liquidity risk. Instability in credit markets and economic conditions can increase the risk of loss in our portfolio. Periodically, we measure the fair value of the investments against the carrying value. If the carrying value of the investments exceeds the fair value, and we conclude the decline is other-than-temporary, we are required to record an impairment of the investments. The impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be disrupted as a result of a threatened proxy contest and other actions of activist stockholders.\nWe have been the subject of actions taken by activist stockholders. When activist activities occur, our business could be adversely affected because we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining customers, agents, mortgage lenders, servicers, employees and board members due to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and negative public statements about our business; such activities may materially harm our relationships with current and potential customers, investors, lenders, and others; may otherwise materially harm our business, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; responding to proxy contests and other similar actions by stockholders is likely to result in our incurring substantial additional costs, including, but not limited to, legal fees, fees for financial advisors, fees for investor relations advisors, and proxy solicitation fees; significantly divert the attention of management, our Board of Directors and our employees; and changes in the composition of our Board of Directors due to activist campaigns may affect the Company's current strategic plan.\nWe cannot predict, and no assurances can be given as to, the outcome or timing of any matters relating to actions by activist stockholders or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in federal, state and local, or foreign tax laws, changing interpretation of existing tax laws, or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate. The laws, regulations and other authoritative guidance relating to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States, the Canada Revenue Agency in Canada, HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom, state and local tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and other similar tax authorities in other international locations. While we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws, rules, and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes based on different applications and interpretations, which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes, interest, and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be proposed or enacted from time to time, which may or will impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory tax rates and other legislative changes, changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, United States federal, state and local, and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Mergers may present certain risks to Stewart\u2019s business and operations prior to the closing of the Mergers, including, among other things, the risks described below. Refer to Note 1-S to our audited consolidated financial statements for details of the merger agreement, including definition of terms.\nFNF\u2019s stock price may be negatively impacted by risks and conditions that apply to FNF, which are different from the risks and conditions applicable to Stewart.\nUpon completion of the Mergers, our stockholders who elect to receive the Stock Election Consideration or Mixed Election Consideration will become holders of FNF Common Stock. The businesses and markets of FNF and the other companies it has acquired and may acquire in the future are different from those of Stewart. There is a risk that various factors, conditions and developments that would not affect the price of our Common Stock could negatively affect the price of FNF Common Stock.\nThe Mergers are subject to the receipt of consents and clearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Stewart or that could delay or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Mergers.\nThe Mergers are subject to approvals or non-disapprovals from or notices to state insurance regulators, state financial institution regulators, state real estate regulators and various other federal, state and international insurance regulatory authorities. We are awaiting for the remaining state and other regulatory approvals. Additionally, the Mergers are currently under review by the FTC under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Before the Mergers may be completed, applicable waiting periods must expire or terminate under antitrust laws and various approvals, consents or clearances may be required to be obtained from regulatory entities. In deciding whether to grant antitrust or other regulatory clearances, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the Mergers on competition within their relevant jurisdictions. The terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of FNF\u2019s business following the Mergers. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the Mergers or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of FNF following the Mergers. In addition, neither FNF nor Stewart can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Mergers.\nAs previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filing, on January 31, 2019, the NYDFS provided written notice of its disapproval of FNF's application to acquire control of Stewart Title Insurance Company, our New York domiciled title insurance underwriter. Receipt of approval from the NYDFS is one of the conditions to the completion of the Mergers. Stewart and FNF are in the process of reaching out to the NYDFS to discuss the notice and seek to resolve the concerns raised therein, with which we and FNF respectfully disagree.\nOur stockholders may not receive all consideration in the form they elect, and the form of consideration that they receive may have a lower value or less favorable tax consequences than the form of consideration that they elect to receive.\nOur stockholders that make an election for either the Cash Election Consideration or the Stock Election Consideration will be subject to proration if holders of our Common Stock, in the aggregate, elect to receive more or less than the aggregate amount of cash consideration to be paid in the Mergers. Accordingly, some of the consideration our stockholders receive in the Mergers may differ from the type of consideration they select and such difference may be significant. This may result in, among other things, tax consequences that differ from those that would have resulted if our stockholders had received solely the form of consideration that they elected. The relative proportion of stock and cash that one of our stockholders receives may also have a value that is higher or lower than the relative proportion of stock and cash that such stockholder elected to receive.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the Mergers.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on our employees may continue to have an adverse effect on us. This uncertainty may continue to affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the Mergers are completed. We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. In addition, if employees of FNF and Stewart depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of the combined company, the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers could be reduced.\nWe will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Mergers.\nWe expect to incur a number of transaction-related costs associated with completing the Mergers, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be substantial. These transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of FNF and Stewart. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.\nThe Mergers are subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to complete the Mergers could have material and adverse effects on us.\nThe completion of the Mergers is subject to a number of conditions which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Mergers uncertain. Also, absent an extension under the terms of the Mergers, either we or FNF may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Mergers have not been completed by March 18, 2019 (or the extended end date, if applicable), unless the failure of the Mergers to be completed by such date has resulted from the failure of the party seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement to perform its obligations.\nIf the Mergers are not completed on a timely basis, or at all, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Mergers, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay FNF a termination fee of $33 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under qualifying circumstances, as described in the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Mergers, whether or not the Mergers are completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022\nunder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Mergers which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies;\n\u2022\ntime and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Mergers could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe market price of our Common Stock could decline below current market prices to the extent that such current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Mergers will be completed; and\n\u2022\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board seeks another business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a business combination or other strategic transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that FNF has agreed to in the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, if the Mergers are not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. We could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Mergers or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Mergers are not completed, we cannot assure our stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not adversely affect the business, financial results and stock prices of Stewart.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Mergers, could discourage a potential competing acquirer from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee of $33 million to FNF.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from entering into an alternative transaction. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, we are restricted from soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating, knowingly encouraging or knowingly inducing or negotiating, any inquiry, proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal with any person. Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, in the event of a potential change by our board of its recommendation with respect to the Mergers in light of a superior proposal, we must provide FNF with four business days\u2019 notice to allow FNF to propose an adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. We may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the no solicitation and termination provisions of the Merger Agreement. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Stewart from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Mergers, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in specified circumstances.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay to FNF a termination fee of $33 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. If such a termination fee is payable, the payment of this fee could have material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and operations.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Mergers are pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Mergers, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts or incur capital expenditures to grow our business. Such limitations could negatively affect our businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Mergers. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the post-merger period can divert management attention and company resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on us.\nIn connection with the pending Mergers, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the proposed Mergers, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of shares of our Common Stock, regardless of whether the Mergers are completed.\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and because the market price of FNF Common Stock and our Common Stock will fluctuate, our stockholders receiving FNF Common Stock as part of the merger consideration cannot be sure of the market value of such merger consideration relative to the value of their shares of our Common Stock that they are exchanging.\nIf the Mergers are completed, each share of our Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive either $50.00 in cash, 1.2850 shares of FNF Common Stock or $25.00 in cash and 0.6425 shares of FNF Common Stock (subject to the adjustment and proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement). During the pendency of the Mergers, the market value of FNF Common Stock will fluctuate, and decreases in the market value of FNF Common Stock will negatively affect the value of the merger consideration that our stockholders receive. The market value of our Common Stock will also fluctuate during the pendency of the Mergers, and increases in the market value of our Common Stock may mean that the merger consideration issued to our stockholders will be worth less than the market value of the shares of our Common Stock such stockholders are exchanging. The exchange ratio was fixed at the time the Merger Agreement was executed, and the value of FNF and Stewart stock may vary significantly from their values on the date of the Merger Agreement, the date of this report, the date on which our stockholders make their election and the date on which our stockholders receive the merger consideration. Neither Stewart nor FNF is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely due to changes in the market price of either party\u2019s common stock.\nThere will be a time lapse between the date on which our stockholders make an election with respect to the form of merger consideration to be received by them in exchange for their Common Stock and the date on which our stockholders actually receive FNF Common Stock, depending on their election and subject to proration. Fluctuations in the market value of FNF stock during this time period will also affect the value of the merger consideration, once it is actually received.\nIf any of our stockholders makes a stock election or mixed election and the market value of FNF Common Stock falls between the time of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of the merger consideration received may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would have received under a cash election. Conversely, if any of our stockholders makes a cash election and the market value of FNF Common Stock rises between the time of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of the merger consideration received may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would have received under a stock or mixed election. Our stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for FNF Common Stock when they make their elections.\nIf the Mergers are approved, the date that our stockholders will receive the merger consideration is uncertain and, due to potential divestitures required by regulatory authorities, the per share purchase price may be adjusted downwards.\nIf the proposed Mergers are approved, the date that our stockholders will receive the merger consideration depends on the completion date of the Mergers, which is uncertain. Additionally, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the combined company is required to divest assets or businesses with 2017 annual revenues in excess of $75 million in order to receive required regulatory approvals (up to a cap of $225 million of 2017 annual revenues), the per share purchase price will be adjusted downwards on a sliding scale between such amounts of divestitures up to a maximum reduction of $4.50 in value in the event that businesses or assets with 2017 annual revenues of $225 million are divested.\nThere can be no assurance that a divestiture or divestitures of businesses and assets in excess of $75 million in 2017 annual revenues will not occur, and accordingly there can be no assurance that holders of our Common Stock will receive (i) for those who make an election for the Cash Election Consideration, $50.00 per share in cash instead of an amount less than $50.00 per share in cash (but in any case, no less than $45.50 per share in cash), (ii) for those who make an election for the Stock Election Consideration, an amount of FNF Common Stock equal to 1.2850 shares of FNF Common Stock per share of our Common Stock instead of an amount of FNF Common Stock less than 1.2850 shares of FNF common stock per share of our common stock calculated based on a reduced exchange ratio for the number of shares of FNF Common Stock per share of our Common Stock or (iii) for those who make an election for the Mixed Election Consideration, $25.00 per share in cash and an amount of FNF Common Stock equal to 0.6425 shares of FNF Common Stock per share of our Common Stock instead of an amount less than $25.00 per share in cash and an amount of FNF Common Stock less than 0.6425 shares of FNF Common Stock per share of our Common Stock calculated based on a reduced exchange ratio for the number of shares of FNF Common Stock per share of our Common Stock, as applicable.", "PERMNO": 72980, "SIC": 6361, "TIC": "STC"}
