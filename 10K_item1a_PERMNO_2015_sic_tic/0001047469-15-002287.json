{"cik": "1226308", "company": "DTS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to maintain a sufficient amount of content released in the DTS audio format, demand for the technologies, products, and services that we offer to consumer electronics product manufacturers may significantly decline, which would adversely impact our business and prospects.\nWe expect to derive a significant percentage of our revenues from the technologies, products, and services that we offer to manufacturers of consumer electronics products. We believe that demand for our audio technologies in growing markets for multi-channel and/or high resolution audio, including TVs, tablets and mobile phones, video game consoles, automobiles, and soundbars, will be based on the amount, quality, and popularity of content (such as movies, TV shows, music, and games) either released in the DTS audio format or capable of being coded and played in the DTS format. In particular, our ability to penetrate the growing markets in the network-connected space depends on the presence of streaming and downloadable content released in the DTS audio format. We generally do not have contracts that require providers of streaming and downloadable content to develop and release such content in a DTS audio format. Accordingly, our revenue could decline if these parties elect not to incorporate DTS audio into their content or if they sell less content that incorporates DTS audio.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in maintaining existing relationships or developing new relationships with other existing or new content providers. As a result, we cannot assure you that a sufficient amount of content will be released in a DTS audio format to ensure that manufacturers continue offering DTS decoders in the consumer electronics products that they sell.\nWe may not be able to evolve our technologies, products, and services, or develop new technologies, products, and services, that are acceptable to our customers or the evolving markets.\nThe markets for our technologies, products, and services is characterized by:\n\u2022 rapid technological change and product obsolescence;\n\u2022 new and improved product introductions;\n\u2022 changing consumer demands;\n\u2022 increasingly competitive product landscape; and\n\u2022 evolving industry standards.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to enhance our existing technologies, products, and services and to develop acceptable new technologies, products, and services on a timely basis. The development of enhanced and new technologies, products, and services is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, highly-skilled engineering and development personnel, and the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to identify, develop, market, or support new or enhanced technologies, products, or services on a timely basis, if at all. Furthermore, our new technologies, products, and services may never gain market acceptance, and we may not be able to respond effectively to evolving consumer demands, technological changes, product\nannouncements by competitors, or emerging industry standards. Any failure to respond to these changes or concerns would likely prevent our technologies, products, and services from gaining market acceptance or maintaining market share and could lead to our technologies, products, and services becoming obsolete.\nOur ability to develop proprietary technologies in markets in which \"open standards\" are adopted may be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and growth.\nStandards-setting bodies may require the use of open standards, meaning that the technologies necessary to meet those standards are publicly available, free of charge and often on an \"open source\" basis. These standards are a relatively recent and limited occurrence and have primarily been focused on markets and regions traditionally adverse to the notion of intellectual property ownership and the associated royalties. If the concept of open standards gains industry momentum in the future, the use of open standards may reduce our opportunity to generate revenue, as open standards technologies are based upon non-proprietary technology platforms in which no one company maintains ownership over the dominant technologies.\nA loss of one or more of our key customers or licensees in any of our markets could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, one or a small number of our customers or licensees may represent a significant percentage of our revenue. While our business is not substantially dependent on any single customer agreement, we have entered into several license agreements with the various divisions and companies that comprise Sony Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., which relate to various types of consumer electronics devices. Each of these significant customers, in the aggregate, accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. For additional information, refer to \"Concentration of Business and Credit Risk\" in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements. Although we have agreements with our customers, many of these agreements do not require any material minimum purchases or minimum royalty fees and typically do not prohibit customers from purchasing or licensing technologies, products, and services from competitors. A decision by any of our major customers or licensees not to use our technologies, or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner, or at all, could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nWe face intense competition and certain of our competitors have greater resources than we do.\nThe digital audio, consumer electronics and entertainment markets are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Our principal competitor is Dolby Laboratories, Inc. (Dolby), who competes with us in most of our markets. We also compete with other companies offering digital audio technology incorporated into consumer electronics product and entertainment mediums, such as Fraunhofer Institut Integrierte Schaltungen.\nCertain of our current and potential competitors may enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including:\n\u2022 greater name recognition;\n\u2022 a longer operating history;\n\u2022 a greater global footprint and presence;\n\u2022 more developed distribution channels and deeper relationships with our common customer base;\n\u2022 a more extensive customer base;\n\u2022 digital technologies that provide features that ours do not;\n\u2022 broader product and service offerings;\n\u2022 greater resources for competitive activities, such as research and development, strategic acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, sales and marketing, subsidies and lobbying industry and government standards;\n\u2022 more technicians and engineers;\n\u2022 greater technical support;\n\u2022 the ability to offer open source or free codecs; and\n\u2022 greater inclusion in government or industry standards.\nAs a result, these current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements.\nIn addition to the competitive advantages described above, Dolby also enjoys other unique competitive strengths relative to us. For example, it introduced multi-channel audio technology before we did. It has also achieved mandatory standard status in product categories that we have not, including terrestrial digital TV broadcasts in the US. As a result of these factors, Dolby has a competitive advantage in selling its digital multi-channel audio technology.\nOur customers, who are also our current or potential competitors, may choose to use their own or competing technologies rather than ours.\nWe face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors. For example, certain of our licensee customers maintain in-house audio engineering teams. To the extent that our customers choose to use technologies they have developed or in which they have an interest, rather than use our technologies, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business and prospects depend upon the strength of our brands, and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brands, our business could be materially harmed.\nEstablishing, maintaining and strengthening our corporate and product brands is critical to our success. Our brand identity is key to maintaining and expanding our business and entering new markets. Our success depends in large part on our reputation for providing high-quality technologies, products, and services to the consumer electronics and entertainment industries. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands successfully, our business and prospects may suffer. Additionally, we believe that the likelihood that our technologies will be adopted in industry standards depends, in part, upon the strength of our brands, because professional organizations and industry participants are more likely to incorporate technologies developed by well-respected and well-known brands into standards.\nDeclining retail prices for consumer electronics products could force us to lower the license or other fees we charge our customers or prompt our customers to exclude our audio technologies from their products altogether, which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe market for consumer electronics products is intensely competitive and price sensitive. Retail prices for consumer electronics products that include our audio technologies have decreased significantly, and we expect prices to continue to decrease for the foreseeable future. Declining prices for consumer electronics products could create downward pressure on the licensing fees we currently charge our customers who integrate our technologies into the consumer electronics products that they\nsell and distribute. As a result of pricing pressure, consumer electronics product manufacturers who produce products in which our audio technologies are not a mandatory standard could decide to exclude our audio technologies from their products altogether.\nOur revenue is dependent upon our customers and licensees incorporating our technologies into their products, and we have limited control over existing and potential customers' and licensees' decisions to include our technologies in their product offerings.\nExcept for Blu-ray products, where our technology is mandatory, we are dependent upon our customers and licensees-including consumer electronics product manufacturers, semiconductor manufacturers, producers and distributors of content-to incorporate our technologies into their products, purchase our products and services, or release their content in our proprietary DTS audio format. We have contracts and license agreements with many of these companies, which generally are non-exclusive and do not contain any minimum purchase commitments. Furthermore, the decision by a party dominant in the entertainment value chain to provide audio technology at very low or no cost could impact a licensee's decision to use our technology. Our customers, licensees and other manufacturers might not utilize our technologies or services in the future. Accordingly, our revenue could decline if our customers and licensees choose not to incorporate our technologies in their products, or if they sell fewer products incorporating our technologies.\nOur licensing revenue depends in large part upon semiconductor manufacturers incorporating our technologies into integrated circuits (ICs), for sale to our consumer electronics product licensees. If our technologies are not incorporated in these ICs, IC production is delayed, or fewer ICs are sold that incorporate our technologies, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur licensing revenue from consumer electronics product manufacturers depends in large part upon the availability of ICs that implement our technologies. IC manufacturers incorporate our technologies into these ICs, which are then incorporated into consumer electronics products. We do not manufacture these ICs, but rather depend upon IC manufacturers to develop, produce and then sell them to licensed consumer electronics product manufacturers. We do not control the IC manufacturers' decisions whether or not to incorporate our technologies into their ICs, and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts. If these IC manufacturers are unable or unwilling to implement our technologies into their ICs, production is delayed, or if they sell fewer ICs incorporating our technologies, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf there is a continued decline in optical disc based media consumption and if our ability to further penetrate the streaming and downloadable content delivery markets and adapt our technologies for those markets is limited, our revenues and ability to grow could be adversely impacted.\nVideo and audio content has historically been purchased and consumed primarily via optical disc based media, such as Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and CD. However, the growth of the internet and network-connected device usage (including PCs, TVs, set-top boxes and DMPs, tablets, and smartphones), along with the rapid advancement of online and mobile content delivery has resulted in the recent trend to entertainment download and streaming services becoming mainstream with consumers in various parts of the world. We expect the shift away from optical disc based media to streaming and downloadable content consumption to continue, which may result in further declines in revenue from Blu-ray Disc and DVD players that incorporate our technologies.\nAlso, the services that provide content from the cloud are not generally governed by international or national standards and are thus free to choose any media format(s) to deliver their products and services. This freedom of choice on the part of online content providers could limit our ability to grow if such content providers do not incorporate our technologies into their services, which could affect demand for our technologies.\nFurthermore, our inclusion in mobile and other network-connected devices may be less profitable for us than optical disc players. The online and mobile markets are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards and business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, frequent new product and service introductions, short product and service life cycles, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers, all of which may result in downward pressure on pricing. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe licensing of patents constitutes a significant source of our revenue. If we do not replace expiring patents with new patents or proprietary technologies, our revenue could decline.\nWe hold patents covering a majority of the technologies that we license, and our licensing revenue is tied in large part to the life of those patents. Our right to receive royalties related to our patents terminates with the expiration of the last patent covering the relevant technologies. Accordingly, to the extent that we do not replace licensing revenue from technologies covered by expiring patents with licensing revenue based on new patents and proprietary technologies, our revenue could decline.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if changing laws have an adverse effect on our ability to protect such rights, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nProtection of our intellectual property is critical to our success. Copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws and confidentiality and other contractual provisions afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We face numerous risks in protecting our intellectual property rights, including the following:\n\u2022 our competitors may produce competitive technologies, products or services that do not unlawfully infringe upon our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 the laws related to the protection of intellectual property may not be the same in all countries or may change over time resulting in no or inadequate protection for our intellectual property, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate;\n\u2022 we may be unable to successfully identify or prosecute unauthorized uses of our technologies;\n\u2022 efforts to identify and prosecute unauthorized uses of our technologies are time consuming, expensive, and divert resources from the operation of our business;\n\u2022 our patents may be challenged, found unenforceable or invalidated by our competitors;\n\u2022 our pending patent applications may be found not patentable, may not issue, or if issued, may not provide meaningful protection for related products or proprietary rights;\n\u2022 we may not be able to practice our trade secrets as a result of patent protection afforded a third-party for such product, technique or process; and\n\u2022 we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees, consultants, and advisors.\nAs a result, our means of protecting our intellectual property rights and brands may prove inadequate or unenforceable. Furthermore, despite our efforts, third parties may violate, or attempt to violate, our intellectual property rights. Enforcement, including infringement claims and lawsuits would likely be expensive to resolve and would require management's time and resources. In addition, we have not sought, and do not intend to seek, patent and other intellectual property protections in all foreign countries. In countries where we do not have such protection, products incorporating our technology may be able to be lawfully produced and sold without a license.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, and we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business.\nCompanies that participate in the digital audio, consumer electronics, and entertainment industries hold a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and are frequently involved in litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property disputes frequently involve highly complex and costly scientific matters, and each party generally has the right to seek a trial by jury which adds additional costs and uncertainty. Accordingly, intellectual property disputes, with or without merit, could be costly and time consuming to litigate or settle, and could divert management's attention from executing our business plan. In addition, our technologies and products may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. If we were unable to obtain any necessary license following a determination of infringement or an adverse determination in litigation or in interference or other administrative proceedings, we may need to redesign some of our technologies or products to avoid infringing a third party's rights and could be required to temporarily or permanently discontinue licensing our technologies or products.\nIn the past, we have been a party to litigation related to protection and enforcement of our intellectual property, and we may be a party to litigation in the future. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages (including treble damages under the Clayton Act) and an injunction prohibiting us from licensing our technologies in particular ways or at all. If an unfavorable ruling occurred, our business and operating results could be materially harmed. In addition, any protracted litigation could divert management's attention from our day-to-day operations, disrupt our business and cause our operating results to suffer.\nWe rely on the accuracy of our customers' manufacturing reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported.\nMost of our revenues are generated from consumer electronics product manufacturers who license and incorporate our technology in their consumer electronics products. Under our existing agreements, many of these customers pay us per-unit licensing fees based on the number of consumer electronics products manufactured that incorporate our technology. We rely on our customers to accurately report the number of units manufactured in collecting our license fees, preparing our financial reports, projections, budgets, and directing our sales and product development efforts. Our license agreements permit us to audit our customers, but audits are generally expensive, time consuming, difficult to manage effectively, dependent in large part upon the cooperation of our licensees and the quality of the records they keep, and could harm our customer relationships. If any of our customer reports understate the number of products they manufacture, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance. Alternatively, customer reports could overstate the number of products manufactured, which would require us to refund the customer and reflect the overstated amount as a reduction of revenue in the period determined.\nWe have in the past and may in the future have disputes with our licensees regarding our licensing arrangements.\nAt times, we are engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our intellectual property rights, including matters related to misreporting of units manufactured, application of royalty rates, and interpretation of other terms of our licensing arrangements. These types of disputes can be asserted by our customers or prospective customers or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. In the past, licensees have threatened to initiate litigation against us regarding our licensing royalty rate practices including our adherence to licensing on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms and potential\nantitrust claims. Damages and requests for injunctive relief asserted in claims like these could be material, and could be disruptive to our business. Any disputes with our customers or potential customers or other third parties could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur technologies and products are complex and may contain errors that could cause us to lose customers, damage our reputation, or incur substantial costs.\nOur technologies or products could contain errors that could cause our technologies or products to operate improperly and could cause unintended consequences. If our technologies or products contain errors, we could be required to replace them, and if any such errors cause unintended consequences, we could face claims for product liability. Although we generally attempt to contractually limit our exposure to incidental and consequential damages, as well as provide insurance coverage for such events, if these contract provisions are not enforced or are unenforceable, if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited, or if our insurance coverage is inadequate to satisfy the liability, we could incur substantial costs in defending or settling product liability claims.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in the future, which may impact profitability.\nWe expect our expenses to increase as we, among other things:\n\u2022 expand our sales and marketing activities, including the continued development of our international operations and increased advertising;\n\u2022 adopt a more customer-focused business model which is expected to entail additional hiring;\n\u2022 acquire businesses or technologies and integrate them into our existing organization;\n\u2022 increase our research and development efforts to advance our existing technologies, products, and services and develop new technologies, products, and services;\n\u2022 hire additional personnel, including engineers and other technical staff;\n\u2022 expand and defend our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022 upgrade our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls.\nAs a result, we will need to grow our revenues and manage our costs in order to positively impact profitability. In addition, we may fail to accurately estimate and assess our increased operating expenses as we grow.\nWe may not successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions or strategic investments.\nWe consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies, products, and businesses that could enhance our technical capabilities, complement our current technologies, products and services, or expand the breadth of our markets. While we have acquired a number of businesses in the past, our history of acquiring and integrating businesses is limited, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition or investment. Future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded business, which could pose substantial challenges for management. Acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks and potential difficulties, including:\n\u2022 problems assimilating the purchased technologies, products, or business operations;\n\u2022 significant future charges relating to in-process research and development and the amortization of intangible assets;\n\u2022 significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortizable and are subject to annual impairment review and potential impairment losses;\n\u2022 problems maintaining and enforcing uniform standards, procedures, controls, policies and information systems;\n\u2022 unanticipated costs, including accounting and legal fees, capital expenditures, and transaction expenses;\n\u2022 diversion of management's attention from our core business;\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited experience;\n\u2022 unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the acquired businesses;\n\u2022 the need to integrate accounting, management information, manufacturing, human resources and other administrative systems and personnel to permit effective management; and\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions and strategic investments, our management team may be distracted from our day-to-day operations, our business may be disrupted, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted. Foreign acquisitions and investments involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures and languages, currency risks and risks associated with the particular economic, political and regulatory environment in specific countries. Furthermore, future results will be affected by our ability or inability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated benefits and synergies. Also, in cases where stockholder approval of an acquisition or strategic investment is required, and we fail to obtain such stockholder approval, the anticipated benefit of our acquisitions and investments may not materialize.\nFuture acquisitions and investments could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may have difficulty managing any growth that we might experience.\nAs a result of a combination of organic growth and growth through acquisitions, we expect to continue to experience growth in the scope of our operations and the number of our employees. If our growth continues, it may place a significant strain on our management team and on our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls. Our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our management team to manage any growth effectively, requiring our management to:\n\u2022 recruit, hire, and train additional personnel;\n\u2022 implement and improve our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls;\n\u2022 maintain our cost structure at an appropriate level based on the revenues we forecast and generate;\n\u2022 manage multiple concurrent development projects; and\n\u2022 manage operations in multiple time zones with different cultures and languages.\nAny failure to successfully manage our growth could distract management's attention and result in failure to execute our business plan.\nWe are dependent upon certain key employees.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continued availability and contributions of our management team and engineering and technical personnel because of the complexity of our technologies, products, and services. Important factors that could cause the loss of key personnel include:\n\u2022 our existing employment agreements with the members of our management team allow such persons to terminate their employment with us at any time;\n\u2022 we do not have employment agreements with a majority of our key engineering and technical personnel;\n\u2022 not maintaining a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity compensation;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain stockholder support for new or amended equity plans to provide the level of initial and annual equity grants expected by key talent in today's competitive job market; and\n\u2022 significant portions of the equity awards are vested or may be underwater.\nThe loss of key personnel or an inability to attract qualified personnel in a timely manner could slow our technology and product development and harm our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2013 because a material weakness existed in internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for revenue. Management determined that this material weakness was remediated during 2014. Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2014 because a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for income taxes. Refer to Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" for additional information.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting cannot guarantee the prevention or detection of a material weakness, we can never guarantee a material weakness over financial reporting will not occur, including with respect to any previously reported material weaknesses. If we identify one or more additional material weaknesses in the future, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur multi-national legal structure is complex, which increases the risk of errors in financial reporting related to our accounting for income taxes. We may find additional errors in our accounting for income taxes or discover new facts that cause us to reach different conclusions. In addition, given the complexity of certain of the Company's license agreements and the accounting standards governing revenue recognition related thereto, we may find additional errors in our accounting for revenue or discover new facts that cause us to reach different conclusions. This could result in adjustments that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. This could also adversely impact our stock price, damage our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards will increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the US. Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. Furthermore, with such uncertainties, we cannot assure you that our system of internal control will be effective or satisfactory to our independent registered public accounting firm. As a result, our financial reporting may not be timely or accurate and we may be issued an adverse or qualified opinion by our independent registered public accounting firm. If reporting delays or material errors actually occur, we could be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could adversely affect our financial results or result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted rules regarding disclosure of the use of conflict minerals (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold), which are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. This requirement could affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used to manufacture certain of our products. Consequently, we will incur costs in complying with these disclosure requirements, including due diligence to determine the source of the minerals used in our products, and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our products. Our reputation may suffer if we determine that our products contain conflict minerals that are not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products.\nIn addition, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) has issued a new 2013 version of its internal control framework, which was deemed by COSO to supersede the 1992 version of the framework effective December 15, 2014. To the best of our knowledge, we have conformed to this updated framework to design and implement our system of internal control over financial reporting. We have invested significant costs and efforts to adopt this updated framework, which has required and may continue to require management's ongoing attention to documenting, maintaining and auditing our internal controls under the new COSO framework.\nFurther, the SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continually updates accounting standards with which we may be required comply. In order to comply with IFRS requirements or implementation of new or updated accounting standards, we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs.\nWe believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nCurrent and future governmental and industry standards may significantly limit our business opportunities.\nTechnology standards are important in the audio and video industry as they help to assure compatibility across a system or series of products. Generally, standards adoption occurs on either a mandatory basis, requiring a particular technology to be available in a particular product or medium, or an optional basis, meaning that a particular technology may be, but is not required to be, utilized. For example, both our digital multi-channel audio technology and Dolby's have optional status in Blu-ray, while both our two-channel output and Dolby's technologies have been selected as mandatory standards in Blu-ray. However, if either or both of these standards are re-examined or a new standard is developed, we may not be included as mandatory in any such new or revised standard which would cause revenue growth in that area of our business to be significantly lower than expected and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nVarious national governments have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for all digital TV broadcasts, including cable, satellite, and terrestrial. In the US, Dolby's audio technology has been selected as the sole, mandatory audio standard for terrestrial digital TV broadcasts. As a result, the audio for all digital terrestrial TV broadcasts in the US must include Dolby's technology and must exclude any other format, including ours. We do not know whether this standard will be reopened or amended. If it is not, our audio technology may never be included in that standard. Certain large and developing markets, such as China, have not fully developed their digital TV standards. Our technology may or may not ultimately be included in these standards.\nAs new technologies and entertainment media emerge, new standards relating to these technologies or media may develop. New standards may also emerge in existing markets that are currently characterized by competing formats, such as the market for PCs. We may not be successful in our efforts to include our technology in any such standards.\nOur licensing of industry standard technologies can be subject to limitations that could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWhen a standards-setting body adopts our technologies as explicit industry standards, we generally must agree to license such technologies on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis, which we believe means that we treat similarly situated licensees similarly. In these situations, we may be required to limit the royalty rates we charge for these technologies, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we may have limited control over whom we license such technologies to, and may be unable to restrict many terms of the license. From time to time, we may be subject to claims that our licenses of our industry standard technologies may not conform to the requirements of the standards-setting body. Claimants in such cases could seek to restrict or change our licensing practices or our ability to license our technologies in ways that could injure our reputation and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur business, operations and reputation could suffer in the event of security breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems, including systems designed and managed by third parties, are becoming more sophisticated and successful. These attempts can include introducing malware to computers and networks, impersonating authorized users, overloading systems and servers and data theft. While we seek to detect and investigate any security issue, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information could\nharm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Further, disruptions to certain of our information technology systems could have severe consequences to our business operations, including financial loss and reputational damage.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe have historically experienced moderate seasonality in our business due to our business mix and the nature of our products. Consumer electronics manufacturing activities are generally lowest in the first calendar quarter of each year, and increase progressively throughout the remainder of the year. Manufacturing output is generally strongest in the third and fourth quarters as our technology licensees increase manufacturing to prepare for the holiday buying season. Since recognition of a majority of revenue lags manufacturing activity by one quarter, our revenues and earnings are generally lowest in the second quarter. The introduction of new technologies, products and services and inclusion of our technologies in new and rapidly growing markets can distort and amplify the seasonality described above. Our revenues may continue to be subject to fluctuations, seasonal or otherwise, in the future. Unanticipated fluctuations, whether due to seasonality, economic downturns, product cycles, or otherwise, could cause us to miss our revenue and earnings projections, or could lead to higher than normal variation in short-term revenue and earnings, either of which could cause our stock price to decline.\nIn addition, we actively engage in intellectual property compliance and enforcement activities focused on identifying third parties who have either incorporated our technologies, trademarks, or know-how without a license or who have underreported to us the amount of royalties owed under license agreements with us. As a result of these activities, from time to time, we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to manufacturing activities from prior periods, and we may incur expenditures related to enforcement activity. These royalty recoveries and expenditures, as applicable, may cause revenues to be higher than expected, or results to be lower than expected, during a particular reporting period and may not recur in future reporting periods. Such fluctuations in our revenues and operating results may cause declines in our stock price.\nWe are subject to additional risks associated with our international operations.\nWe market and sell our technologies, products and services outside the US. We currently have employees located in several countries throughout Europe and Asia, and most of our customers and licensees are located outside the US. As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales and customer support. During the year ended December 31, 2014, over 85% of our revenues were derived internationally. We face numerous risks in doing business outside the US, including:\n\u2022 unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements;\n\u2022 tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargos, and other trade barriers;\n\u2022 difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 competition from foreign companies;\n\u2022 dependence upon foreign distributors and their sales channels;\n\u2022 longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022 less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property;\n\u2022 changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the US dollar and the cost of currency exchange;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences, including withholding VAT and other sales-related taxes, and changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022 cultural differences in the conduct of business.\nSuch factors could cause our future international sales to decline.\nOur business practices in international markets are also subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If any of our employees are found to have violated these requirements, we and our employees could be subject to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.\nOur international revenue is mostly denominated in US dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and foreign currencies may make our technologies, products, and services more expensive for international customers, which could cause them to decrease their business with us. Expenses for our subsidiaries are denominated in their respective local currencies. As a result, if the US dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated expenses will result in higher operating expense without a corresponding increase in revenue. Significant fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and foreign currencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, KRW, RMB, SGD and TWD. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the US and in foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may come under audit by tax authorities. For instance, the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) is examining our 2009 and 2010 corporate tax returns, including certain prior period carryforwards from 2006 to 2008. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the results of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result. In addition, changes in tax rules, such as expiration of tax credits, may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the US, and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions would result in additional tax expense. In addition, there have been proposals to change US and foreign tax laws that would significantly impact how US multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association of 34 countries including the United States, is contemplating revisions to certain corporate tax, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions. If and when the OECD finalizes these revisions, they could be adopted by many countries. These contemplated revisions, if adopted by various countries, could increase our income taxes and adversely affect our provision for income taxes. Although we\ncannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.\nEconomic downturns could disrupt and materially harm our business.\nNegative trends in the general economy could cause a downturn in the market for our technologies, products and services, as the end-products in which our technologies are incorporated are discretionary goods, including TVs, speakers, soundbars, PCs, and mobile devices. Weakness in the global financial markets could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and volatility in credit and equity markets. Such a weakness could adversely affect our operating results if it results, for example, in the insolvency of a key licensee or other customer, the inability of our licensees or other customers to obtain credit to finance their operations, including financing the manufacture of products containing our technologies, and delays in reporting or payments from our licensees. Tight credit markets could also delay or prevent us from acquiring or making investments in other technologies, products or businesses that could enhance our technical capabilities, complement our current technologies, products, and services, or expand the breadth of our markets. If we are unable to execute such acquisitions or strategic investments, our operating results and business prospects may suffer.\nIn addition, global economic conditions, including increased cost of commodities, widespread employee layoffs, actual or threatened military action by the US and the threat of terrorism could result in decreased consumer confidence, disposable income and spending. Any reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income may negatively affect the demand for consumer electronics products that incorporate our technologies.\nWe cannot predict other negative events that may have adverse effects on the global economy in general and the consumer electronics industry specifically. However, the factors described above and such unforeseen events could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\nWe have a limited operating history in certain new and evolving consumer electronics markets.\nOur technologies have only recently been incorporated into certain markets, such as mobile devices and wireless speakers. We do not have the same experience in these markets as in our traditional consumer electronics business, nor do we have as much operating history as other companies, such as Dolby. As a result, the demand for our technologies, products, and services and the income potential of these businesses is unproven. In addition, because our participation in these markets is relatively new and rapidly evolving, we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. Before investing in our common stock, investors should consider the risks, uncertainties, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as ours. We may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness, and covenant restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nWe entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo) in September 2014, which provides us with a $25.0 million secured revolving line of credit and a $25.0 million secured term loan. During 2014, we repaid the $30.0 million line of credit under the previously existing loan agreement with MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (formerly known as Union Bank, N.A.), and repaid $5.0 million on the term loan with Wells Fargo. As of December 31, 2014, we had $20.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $5.0 million under the revolving line of credit.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things:\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions, because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments;\n\u2022 causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flows to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other business activities;\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and\n\u2022 limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nThe terms of our indebtedness include certain reporting and financial covenants, as well as other covenants, that, among other things, may restrict our ability to: dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, pay dividends, repurchase common stock, create liens on assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants or restrictions, such failure may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the lenders increasing the interest rate as of the date of default or accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness. If the maturity is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and such acceleration would adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, the indebtedness under our credit agreement is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and therefore, if we are unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on these assets, which would adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including:\n\u2022 acceptance of, and demand for, our technologies, products and services;\n\u2022 the costs of developing new technologies or products;\n\u2022 the extent to which we invest in new technologies and research and development projects;\n\u2022 the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022 the costs associated with our expansion; and\n\u2022 the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our intellectual property.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, particularly given the credit crisis and downturn in the overall global economy. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our technologies, products, and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements. This may materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNatural or other disasters could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nNatural or other disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the US or abroad, and the consequences and effects thereof, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our business partners and customers, or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Our corporate headquarters and many of our operations are located in California, a seismically active region, potentially exposing us to greater risk of natural disasters.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or non-GAAP operating income or loss;\n\u2022 market perception of our progress toward announced objectives;\n\u2022 announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors or technology standards;\n\u2022 announcements of significant contracts or partnerships by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022 developments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 the introduction of new technologies or products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 the commencement of or our involvement in litigation;\n\u2022 resolution of significant litigation in a manner adverse to our business;\n\u2022 our sale or purchase of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022 conditions and trends in technology and entertainment industries;\n\u2022 changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022 the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022 announcements of potential acquisitions;\n\u2022 the adoption rate of new products incorporating our or our competitors' technologies, including mobile devices;\n\u2022 changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that\ncompany. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.\nShares of our common stock may be relatively illiquid.\nAs a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if our operating results do not meet or exceed their projections, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us or our industry downgrade our stock or the stock of other companies in our industry, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or industry, or if our results do not meet or exceed their projections, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our stock.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our Board of Directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022 authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022 provide for a classified Board of Directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022 prohibit stockholders from filling Board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent; and\n\u2022 require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Restated Bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board, and could delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 89793, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "DTSI"}
