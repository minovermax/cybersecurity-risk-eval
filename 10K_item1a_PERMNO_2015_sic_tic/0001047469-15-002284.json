RISK FACTORS\nAny of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements contained herein and elsewhere. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us, or those we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success relies, in part, on the strength of our festivals and events, as well as our online businesses, and if any of them were to become less popular, our business could suffer.\nWe produce, promote and manage EMC festivals and events including Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld, Sensation, Mysteryland, Q-Dance, Stereosonic, Electric Zoo, Nature One, MayDay, Ruhr-in-Love, Life in Color, Rock in Rio and Decibel, as well as ticketing and other digital businesses, including Beatport. Our growth strategy relies on the strength of these brands to attract customers to our festivals and events, both through attendance at the original festivals and in new markets, as well as to our online digital properties. We also rely on the strength of these brands to secure sponsorships and marketing partners and to facilitate growth in revenue from the sale of music and other content, as well as advertising on our online properties. Maintaining the strength of our festivals, events and online businesses will be challenging, and our relationship with our fans could be harmed for many reasons, including the quality of the experience at a particular festival or event, our competitors developing more popular events or attracting talent from our businesses, adverse occurrences or publicity in connection with an event and changes to public tastes that are beyond our control and difficult to anticipate. If our key properties become less popular with consumers within the EMC community, our growth strategy would be harmed, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial results.\nMaintaining the popularity of our festivals, events and online businesses requires that we anticipate consumer preferences and offer attractions that appeal to the EMC community. Our customers' preferences and tastes for these attractions can change and evolve rapidly, and our competitors actively seek to provide new and compelling experiences at their EMC events. If we fail to anticipate or respond quickly to changes in public taste, our festivals and related offerings may become less attractive to consumers.\nFurthermore, our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and produce live entertainment, sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events. Therefore, our ticketing business' success depends, in part, upon such parties' ability to accurately anticipate public demand for particular events, as well as the availability of popular artists, entertainers and teams.\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and expanding our music, video and other content offerings.\nWe intend to continue to develop Beatport as a key point of contact between us and the EMC community, however, we face a number of challenges and risks. For example, we are developing additional media content, such as news, lifestyle videos and blogs, which we believe will be attractive to members of the EMC community, but we may not be successful in developing these offerings. Consumers may also decide to access similar offerings from our competitors. We may fail to enhance the consumer experience, deepen engagement with the EMC community or achieve the improvements we seek to make. Any of these occurrences may prevent us from improving our connection to our customers and bringing more traffic to the Beatport website or further developing Beatport as a key point of contact for the EMC community and increasing ticket sales for our festivals and events. If we fail to properly execute our strategy in this area, it will be harder for us to achieve the growth we expect, and our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nOur recent announcement that Robert F. X. Sillerman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has offered to negotiate with the Company a transaction whereby he would acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock that he does not already own could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\nOn February 25, 2015, we received a proposal from Robert F.X. Sillerman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to negotiate with us a transaction whereby Mr. Sillerman would acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock that he does not already own at a price of $4.75 per share in cash. Our board of directors has established a special committee of independent directors to review the nonbinding offer by Mr. Sillerman.\nThe announcement and pendency of our potential acquisition by Mr. Sillerman could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business. This uncertainty could result in, among other things, volatility in our stock price and an increased concentration in the ownership of our common stock. The uncertainty may also affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees who may have concerns regarding their future roles with our company. Uncertainty as to our future could also adversely affect our reputation and our relationship with existing customers and suppliers and potential customers and suppliers. For example, customers, suppliers and others that deal with us could defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Furthermore, in the event the special committee does agree to accept Mr. Sillerman's offer, a substantial amount of the attention of management will necessarily be diverted from our day-to-day operations in order to consummate the transaction, which will require a significant amount of time and resources.\nWe are vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth.\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we expect to achieve organically and the demands and additional responsibilities that our growth will place on our management.\nThe following factors could present us with difficulties:\n\u2022 a lack of sufficient executive-level personnel;\n\u2022 the inability to develop and monetize our online properties;\n\u2022 an increased administrative burden on our employees;\n\u2022 the inability to attract, train, manage and retain the qualified personnel necessary to manage and operate a greater number of festivals, events and other business activities; and\n\u2022 the inability to integrate acquired businesses, including financial reporting integration of globally dispersed businesses.\nIf we fail to address these and other challenges associated with our growth, our growth itself may slow or fail to materialize, we may grow without achieving profitability, we may have difficulty with our internal controls, procedures and financial reporting, and the quality of our festivals, events and other offerings may decline, among other things. Any of these results could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not successfully expand into new geographic markets, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on the expansion of our festivals and events into new geographic markets where they have not previously taken place and into related lines of business. This strategy entails a number of risks. For example, it is not clear that these new markets will have the demand for these festivals and events that we anticipate, which could adversely affect the ticket sales or pricing for these events. There may also be unforeseen difficulties with holding festivals and events in new markets, including obtaining venues, securing requisite licenses and government approvals, and\nrecruiting artists to the location, among other factors. It is also possible that the audiences in a new location will not find a festival to be as attractive or worthwhile as the audience in the festival's home city. In addition, the demands and time commitment necessary to stage a festival in multiple locations could make it difficult for our management to oversee that festival effectively; for this reason or otherwise, we may fail to replicate the quality of the original festival in its new location. Providing festivals in new locations may also undermine demand for a festival in its original location, because many of the fans of these festivals travel long distances to attend. Finally, EMC fans may prefer their local festivals to ones that we bring from another city or country. The failure to expand our festivals into new geographies would adversely affect our growth and results of operations. Furthermore, because staging festivals in new locations involves substantial expense, we could suffer significant losses if these festivals fail to attract the expected audience in their new locations.\nWe also intend to continue to partner with key companies and organizations that could sponsor both our individual events and festivals and our platform as a whole. We are actively seeking and negotiating with existing and potential sponsorship partners, however, there is significant competition for these types of relationships, and we may fail to establish them for a particular event or for our business as a whole or fail to obtain the number of marketing partnerships or sponsorships or the level of associated compensation that we expect. Failing to secure or retain such sponsorship partners to the degree we expect would harm our growth plan and adversely affect our financial results.\nIt is possible that the popularity of electronic music and the EMC community will not continue their current growth or even decline.\nWe have focused our business on the broad market for electronic music and the EMC community, including electronic music festivals and events, venues, sponsorships and ecommerce. Accordingly, our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued growth of the popularity of electronic music and the EMC community, however, this growth is subject to the whims of public taste, which may change over time and may be beyond our control. While interest in electronic music has increased significantly over the past few years, this increased interest may not continue, and it is possible that the public's current level of interest in electronic music will decline. If either were to happen, the demand for and interest in EMC festivals, events and venues and our online properties and ticketing business could fail to meet our expectations or even decline. This would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe number of EMC festivals and events may grow faster than the public's demand, which could make it difficult for us to attract customers to our festivals and events.\nWith the growing EMC community, there has been a significant increase in the number of EMC festivals and events due to the creation of new events and the expansion of existing events, both in geography and duration. Our growth strategy includes increasing the number of EMC festivals and events we produce each year, as well as increasing the frequency of established events by bringing them to new cities and countries. It is possible that the proliferation of EMC festivals and events will outpace demand. Further, many of the largest festivals attract fans who travel great distances to attend. It is possible that an increase in the availability of local quality EMC festivals and events will make it less likely that these fans will travel to the same festivals in other locations. If either were to occur, it could make it difficult for us to achieve the increase in overall attendance that is part of our growth strategy or force us to offer tickets at reduced prices, either of which would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, competition for advertising marketing partners, and sponsorships may lead to fewer business partners at our events or lower compensation, with a resulting decrease in revenue. Our competitors may offer increased guarantees to artists and more favorable terms and ticketing arrangements to other parties, which we may be unwilling or unable to match. Even if we are willing to match our competitors' terms, the profitability of our events could decline.\nWe must match the innovation of our competitors.\nThere is currently a tremendous amount of innovation among EMC-focused businesses, including the different experiential aspects of festivals and other live performances. These include things such as video presentations, lighting, special effects, sets and other creative elements. Businesses in the EMC industry compete, in part, based on their ability to provide experiences for their audiences that are both cutting edge and compelling. Innovation in our industry is taking place both at the companies that produce festivals and events, as well as at smaller companies that are retained by producers and performers to create artistic elements to accompany the music and enhance the experience of the fans. We must be able to match the quality and inventiveness of these competitors at our own festivals and events. If we fail to do so, it could lead to reduced demand for tickets to our festivals and events, harm our reputation or the reputation of our festivals and events and adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nFurthermore, the ticketing industry is characterized by transforming industry standards, frequent new service and product introductions, enhancements and changing customer demands. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough and/or in a cost-effective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements and preferences, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition, the ongoing widespread adoption of new internet or telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our respective services or infrastructures. If we fail to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures in response to these developments, our existing websites, services and technologies could be rendered obsolete, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nIf we are forced to cancel or postpone all or part of a scheduled festival or event, our business will be adversely impacted and our reputation may be harmed.\nWe incur a significant amount of up-front costs when we plan and prepare for a festival or event. Accordingly, if a planned festival or event is canceled, we would lose a substantial amount of sunk costs, fail to generate the anticipated revenue and may be forced to issue refunds for tickets sold. If we are forced to postpone a planned festival or event, we would incur substantial additional costs in connection with our having to stage the event on a new date, may have reduced attendance and revenue and may have to refund money to ticketholders. In addition, any cancellation or postponement could harm both our reputation and the reputation of the particular festival or event.\nWe could be compelled to cancel or postpone all or part of an event or festival for many reasons, including such things as low attendance, adverse weather conditions, technical problems, issues with permitting or government regulation, incidents, injuries or deaths at that event or festival, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as terrorist attacks, mass-casualty incidents and natural disasters or similar events. We often have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our insured losses if we are compelled to cancel an event or festival, but our coverage may not be sufficient and may be subject to deductibles. The occurrence of an extraordinary condition at or near the site where a festival or event will be held may make it impossible or difficult to stage the event or make it difficult for attendees to travel to the site of a festival or event. The third day of each of the Hudson Project Music and Arts Festival outside of Albany, New York, and the Electric Zoo Festival at Randall's Island, New York were canceled in July and September 2014, respectively, due to severe weather. An extraordinary incident may also make it inappropriate to hold a festival or event at a particular site or at a particular time. For example, the third day of the Electric Zoo festival in September 2013 at Randall's Island, New York was canceled after there were two fatalities, which the media reported to have been related to drug use by the individuals during the first two days of the festival. Electric Zoo is produced by Made, which we acquired in October 2013.\nCosts associated with, and our ability to obtain adequate insurance, could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nHeightened concerns and challenges regarding property, casualty, liability, artist, business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from security incidents, including terrorism, along with varying weather-related conditions and incidents. As a result, we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs, including coverage for acts of terrorism and weather-related property damage.\nWe cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits, including insurance coverage for property, casualty, liability, artist and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism, would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple adverse events occur at or near any of our venues or events, or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to pay our related claims. We cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available, offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness. If adverse events that our insurance policies do not cover occur and result in a significant liability to us, our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nTo stage festivals in multiple locations, we may be required to transport complex sets and equipment long distances, which creates increased risk that they will be damaged.\nOur larger festivals require complex sets and other equipment, including those that currently exist, and those we must construct or purchase from a supplier. We are often required to transport these sets and equipment long distances by land and sea, which creates the risk that they may be damaged or lost if there is an accident or other complication during transport. These sets and equipment are very costly to create and it would be expensive and time consuming to repair or replace them. We have insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our insured losses for damaged or lost sets and equipment, but our coverage may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles. Additionally, a supplier's failure to timely deliver the sets and equipment to us or our loss of these sets and equipment might lead to substantial expenses and could force us to delay or cancel a festival or event. Any of these scenarios could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial results.\nThere is the risk of personal injuries and accidents occurring at our live music events, which could subject us to personal injury or other claims, increase our expenses and damage our brands.\nThere are inherent risks in live festivals and events, particularly those like ours, which involve complex staging and special effects. As a result, personal injuries and accidents have occurred in the concert industry, including some that have injured or killed employees and guests. Injuries and accidents occurring in connection with our festivals, events or venues could subject us to claims and liabilities, and certain of the businesses we have acquired or plan to acquire have been subject to such claims. Injuries and accidents occurring in connection with our live festivals and events, or at any of the venues we manage, could also harm our reputation with artists and fans and make it more difficult for us to obtain sponsors. News of any such incident or accident could also reduce attendance at our events, or lead to the cancellation of all or part of an event or festival, in each case leading to a decrease in our revenue. While we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient, in management's judgment, to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances. In particular, if there were to be a major incident resulting in multiple deaths or injuries at one of our events or venues, it is unlikely our insurance would cover the full liability. We would be responsible for any liabilities not covered by our insurance policies, which would negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to state \"dram shop\" laws and regulations, which generally provide that a person injured by an intoxicated person may seek to recover damages from an establishment that\nwrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Recent litigation of \"dram shop\" laws and regulations targeted at restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including many recent instances of punitive damages; such laws may be extended to apply to our events and festivals. While we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, we may still be subject to a judgment in excess of our insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs, if at all. Regardless of whether any claims made against us are valid or whether we are liable, we may be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from such laws.\nCertain activities or conduct, such as illegal drug use, at our properties or the festivals and events we produce may expose us to liability, cause us to lose business licenses or government approvals, result in the cancellation of all or a part of an event or festival or result in adverse publicity.\nWe are subject to risks associated with certain activities or conduct, such as drug use at our festivals, events or venues, that are illegal or violate the terms of our business licenses. Illegal activities or conduct at any of our events or venues may result in negative publicity, adverse consequences (including illness, injury or death) to the persons engaged in the illegal activity or others and litigation against us. We have established a medical procedure and safety committee and have developed policies and procedures aimed at ensuring that the operation of each festival and event is conducted in conformance with local, state and federal laws. Additionally, we have a \"no tolerance\" policy on illegal drug use in or around our facilities, and we continually monitor the actions of entertainers, fans and our employees to ensure that proper behavioral standards are met. However, such policies, no matter how well designed and enforced, cannot provide absolute assurance that the policies' objectives are achieved. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems and policies, there can be no assurance that our policies will prevent deliberate acts by persons attempting to violate or circumvent them. The consequences of these acts may increase our costs, result in the loss or termination of leases for our venues by property owners (including governments and other parties that own the land at our venues), result in our inability to get the necessary permits and locations for our events or lead to the cancellation of all or part of an event or festival. For example, the third day of the 2013 Electric Zoo festival at Randall's Island, New York was canceled after there were two fatalities, which the media reported to have been related to drug use by the individuals during the first two days of the festival. These consequences may also make it more difficult for us to obtain or retain our business partners, including sponsors, lower consumer demand for our events, subject us to liability claims, divert management's attention from our business and make an investment in our securities unattractive to current and potential investors. These outcomes could have the effect of lowering our revenue profitability and/or our stock price.\nWe face intense competition in the live music, media and ticketing industries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in the highly competitive live music, media and ticketing industries, and this competition may prevent us from maintaining or increasing our current revenue. The live music industry, including electronic dance music, competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers' discretionary spending. Within the live music industry, we compete with other promoters and venue operators to attract customers and talent to events and festivals, as well as to obtain the support of sponsors and advertisers and other business partners. Our competitors include large promotion and entertainment companies, some with substantial scale, that have begun to focus on EMC, smaller promoters that focus on a single festival or event or a particular region or country, venue operators and other producers of live events. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are and have greater resources and stronger relationships with artists, venues, sponsors and advertisers than we do. Others have substantial experience in and strong relationships in the EMC community and are primarily focused on EMC. Our competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts for large-scale events, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and\nmake more attractive offers to existing and potential advertisers and sponsors and other business partners.\nWith respect to our media offerings, we compete for the time and attention of our users with other content providers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, popularity and diversity of content, ease of use, price, accessibility and perception of the number of advertisements and brand awareness and reputation. We face competition from providers of interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, such as iHeartRadio, iTunes Radio and iTunes Music Store, Google Songza, Pandora, Spotify, Slacker, and RDIO, which allow online listeners to select the audio content that they stream or purchase. The audio entertainment marketplace continues to rapidly evolve, providing listeners of online music with a growing number of alternatives and new access models. Our current and future competitors in music may have more well-established brand recognition, more established relationships with consumer product manufacturers and content licenses, greater financial, technical and other resources, more sophisticated technologies or more experience in the markets in which we compete. If we are unable to compete successfully for listeners against other providers by maintaining and increasing our presence and visibility, our Beatport music sales may fail to increase as expected or decline and our advertising sales will suffer.\nOur ticketing business faces intense competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service providers to obtain new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis. We also face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell self-ticketing systems and from clients who choose to self-ticket, through the integration of self-ticketing systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season, subscription or group sales. Additionally, we face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with capabilities to distribute online. The emergence of new technology, particularly related to online ticketing, has intensified this competition. The high competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to substantial governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures, both domestically and internationally, which are subject to change at any time, governing matters such as:\n\u2022 operation of venues;\n\u2022 licensing, permitting and zoning, including ordinances relating to health, noise, traffic and pollution;\n\u2022 human health, safety and sanitation requirements;\n\u2022 the service of food and alcoholic beverages;\n\u2022 working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws;\n\u2022 the ADA;\n\u2022 the FCPA and similar regulations in other countries;\n\u2022 sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;\n\u2022 privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information;\n\u2022 marketing activities via the telephone and online; and\n\u2022 primary ticketing and ticket resale services.\nOur failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and proceedings against us by governmental agencies and consumers, which if material, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities. For example, some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at events, particularly those that involve drugs and alcohol. Additionally, new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business, such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods, mandate ticket inventory disclosure, and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams.\nFrom time to time, federal, state and local authorities and consumers commence investigations, inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection, advertising, unfair business practice, antitrust (and similar or related laws) and other laws. We may be required to incur significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of future governmental investigations and litigation.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from our international operations as a result of our foreign acquisitions and the expansion of our domestic acquisitions into foreign territories. Operating in multiple foreign countries involves substantial risk. For example, our business activities subject us to a number of laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and security requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations. As we expand into additional countries, the complexity inherent in complying with these laws and regulations increases, making compliance more difficult and costly and driving up the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including the incurrence of significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Any failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, make it more difficult or impossible for us to do business in that country and/or harm our reputation. In addition, our acquisition strategy will require us to operate in countries with different business environments, labor conditions, tax obligations and/or other costs, and local customs, including some that conflict with each other or with which we are unfamiliar. This could make it more difficult to operate our business successfully in these countries.\nOperating in multiple countries also subjects us to risk from currency fluctuations. Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. This could either reduce the U.S. dollar value of our prices or, if we raise prices in the local currency, it could reduce the overall demand for our offerings, and either could adversely affect our revenue. Conversely, a rise in the price of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely impact our profitability because it would increase our costs denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nAdditionally, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets in light of the continuing debt crisis in certain European countries. A default or a withdrawal from the Eurozone by any of the countries involved, or the uncertainty alone, could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate. This, or a change to a local currency, would reduce the purchasing power of affected European customers. We are unable to predict the likelihood of any of these events, but if any occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAt this time we do not use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge our exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Any future use of\nsuch hedging instruments may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time such instruments are in place.\nA deterioration in general economic conditions and its impact on consumer and business spending, particularly by customers in our targeted millennial generation demographic, could adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur business and financial results are influenced significantly by general economic conditions, in particular, those conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending. During past economic slowdowns and recessions, many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures. An economic downturn can result in reduced ticket revenue, lower customer spending and more limited and less lucrative sponsorship opportunities.\nFor consumers, such factors as employment levels, fuel prices, interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact attendance and spending at our and other EMC events, including the EMC events for which Paylogic, Flavorus and Clubtix provide ticketing services, and consumer willingness to purchase music from Beatport. For us, these risks may be exacerbated by the fact that our core customer demographic and the majority of attendees at our events and festivals are 18 to 34 years old, and this millennial generation is among the groups most negatively affected by economic downturns. Business conditions, in particular corporate marketing and promotional spending, can also significantly impact our operating results. These factors affect our revenue from sponsorship and advertising. Accordingly, if current economic conditions deteriorate, our growth and financial results will be adversely affected.\nOur operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter, so our financial performance in certain quarters may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our financial performance in other quarters.\nOur results of operations, and in particular the revenue we generate from a given activity, vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We expect most of our largest festivals to occur outdoors, primarily in warmer months. For example, our North American and European brands stage most of their festivals and events in late summer and early fall, while in the Southern Hemisphere most of our festivals take place in September, November and December. As such, we expect our revenues from these festivals to be higher during the third and fourth quarters, and lower in the first and second quarters. Furthermore, because we expect to conduct a limited number of large festivals and other events, small variations in this number from quarter to quarter can cause our revenue and net income to vary significantly for reasons that may be unrelated to the performance of our core business. Other portions of our business, such as our club management business, are generally not subject to seasonal fluctuation or experience much lower seasonal fluctuation. In the future, we expect these fluctuations to change and perhaps become less pronounced as we grow our business, stage more festivals and events in the Southern Hemisphere and acquire additional businesses. We believe our cash needs will vary significantly from quarter to quarter, depending on among other things, the timing of festivals and events, cancellations, ticket on-sales, capital expenditures, seasonal and other fluctuations in our business activity, the timing of guaranteed payments or sponsorship and marketing partnership revenues and receipt of ticket sales and fees, financing activities, acquisitions and investments. Accordingly, our results for any particular quarter may vary for a number of reasons, including due to the reasons described herein, and we caution investors to evaluate our quarterly results in light of these factors.\nWe depend on relationships with key event promoters, sponsor and marketing partners, executives, managers and artists, and adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur venue management and event promotion businesses are particularly dependent upon personal relationships, as promoters and executives within entertainment companies such as ours leverage their network of relationships with artists, agents, managers and sponsor and marketing partners to secure the rights to the performers and events that are critical to our success. Due to the importance of those industry contacts, the loss of any of our officers or other key personnel who have relationships with these artists, agents or managers could adversely affect our venue management and event promotion businesses. While we have hiring policies and procedures and conduct background checks of our promoters, executives, managers and artists, they may engage in or may have in the past engaged in conduct we do not endorse or that is otherwise improper, which may result in reputational harm to us. In the past, we have terminated our relationships with such personnel, but we cannot provide any assurances that we will learn of all instances of misconduct. Also, to the extent artists, agents and managers we have relationships with are replaced with individuals with whom our officers or other key personnel do not have relationships, our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on key members of management, particularly the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Sillerman, and the loss of their services or investor confidence in them could adversely affect our success, development and financial condition.\nOur success depends, to a large degree, upon certain key members of our management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Robert F.X. Sillerman. Our executive team's expertise and experience in acquiring, integrating and growing businesses, particularly those focused on live music and events, have been and will continue to be a significant factor in our growth and ability to execute our business strategy. The loss of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to attract qualified personnel.\nOur ability to expand operations to accommodate our anticipated growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, however, competition for the types of employees we seek is intense. We face particular challenges in recruiting and retaining personnel who have experience in integration of globally dispersed acquired companies, festival operators, software engineering, mobile application development and other technical expertise which is critical to our initiatives. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality personnel with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to attract qualified personnel to execute our business strategies or to develop and expand our business.\nWhen we acquire new businesses, we typically retain the existing managers and executives of the acquired companies to continue managing and operating the acquired business. We believe that they have the market expertise and network of personal relationships to best implement the growth strategies of the acquired businesses. If we are unable to retain the key personnel of the acquired businesses, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of an acquisition. If we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nMembers of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, have divided responsibilities and are not required to devote any specified amount of time to our business.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Robert F.X. Sillerman, is also the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Viggle Inc. (\"Viggle\"), which is in the business of developing products and services that encourage consumers to engage with television content. Mr. Sillerman is also a director of Circle Entertainment Inc. (\"Circle\"), which is in the business of developing location-based entertainment venues. Our employment agreement with Mr. Sillerman requires that he devote his time, attention, energy, knowledge, best professional efforts and skills to the duties assigned to him by us, but he is permitted to pursue other professional endeavors and investments that do not violate the terms of his employment agreement, including provisions relative to non-competition and non-solicitation. Mr. Sillerman's employment agreement expressly permits him to engage in certain listed endeavors and investments. Any other professional endeavors to be performed by Mr. Sillerman are subject to the reasonable approval of our board of directors. Importantly, Mr. Sillerman's employment agreement does not require him to devote any specific amount of time to our Company. Accordingly, it is possible that Mr. Sillerman will fail to devote the necessary time to our Company. Similarly, under our employment agreements with Mitchell Slater, Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors, Gregory Consiglio, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Sheldon Finkel, our Chairman of Strategy and Development, Timothy J. Crowhurst, our President of Strategic Development, and Kevin Arrix, our Executive Vice President of Global Brand Partnerships, such officers are permitted to, and such officers have informed us, that they intend to engage in specific endeavors that are listed in their agreements or pre-approved by our board and other endeavors that do not compete with us. Such officers are not contractually required to devote any specified amount of time to our business.\nWe rely on third-party content, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe contract with third parties to offer their content on our Beatport website. The licensing arrangements with these third parties are generally short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all.\nThe Beatport website requires us to obtain rights in two types of copyrighted works: the sound recordings that we stream and sell, and the underlying musical compositions in those sound recordings. With respect to the sound recordings, we enter into license agreements with the record companies that own and/or control such recordings. Our arrangements with the record companies allow us to copy and distribute those recordings to the public, and to publicly perform portions of those tracks for users as previews for purchase. When we receive notice that a track offered on the website is not properly licensed or authorized for sale, we follow the notice-and-takedown procedures outlined in Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the \"DMCA\"), which provides a safe-harbor from copyright infringement liability for online services that adhere to the law's requirements.\nWith respect to the underlying musical compositions, we must secure both reproduction (\"mechanical\") and public performance rights from the music publishers who control the compositions. In the United States, the record companies with whom we contract for the sale of sound recordings also clear the mechanical rights from the publishers. We have entered into necessary negotiations with rightsholders in and for all major non-U.S. markets and repertoire, excluding certain developing territories that may not have a performance rights organization or repertoire that is unaffiliated with any local society.\nThird-party content providers and distributors may, now or in the future, offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for us to license their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit our access to, increase the cost of, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such content. As a result, we may be unable to\ncontinue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach.\nAll content on Beatport is currently provided free of digital rights management. If our requirements or business model changes, we may have to develop or license new technology to provide other solutions. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force us to license our digital rights management, if any, which could weaken the protection of content and subject us to piracy and also negatively affect arrangements with our content providers.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe may be unable to detect unauthorized use of, or otherwise sufficiently protect, our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use proprietary information, trademarks or copyrighted material without authorization, which if discovered, might require legal action to correct. Furthermore, our recently acquired assets may have been improperly adopted or inadequately protected prior to our acquisitions of them. This could include failures to obtain assignments of ownership or confidentiality agreements from third parties, failures to clear use of trademarks or other failures to protect trademarks and other proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop similar intellectual property or duplicate our services.\nWe will apply to register, or secure by contract when appropriate, our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate. While we vigorously protect our trademarks, service marks and domain names as we deem appropriate, effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in the erosion of brand names or the loss of rights to our owned or licensed marks and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our loss of, or inability to otherwise obtain rights to use third-party trademarks and service marks, including the loss of exclusive rights to use third-party trademarks in territories where we present festivals, could adversely affect our business or otherwise result in competitive harm.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. The legal proceedings and claims include notices provided to us by content owners of users' violation of the DMCA, which obligate us to investigate and remove infringing user content from the Beatport site. We also face a risk that content licensors may bring claims for copyright infringement or breach of contract if Beatport users exceed the scope of the content licenses or offer compositions or sound recordings not covered by our existing content license. Because EMC involves remixing and sampling of others' music, and because such remixes are typically performed publicly, if our content license agreements do not grant us or our users sufficient use rights, or if we facilitate the performance of music for which we do not have a license, our supply of such content on Beatport could expose us to claims of copyright infringement. We may not be able to successfully defend against such claims, which may result in a limitation on our ability to\nuse the intellectual property subject to these claims and also might require us to enter into settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face an injunction prohibiting us from using the affected intellectual property in connection with our services.\nIn addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.\nMoreover, we use open source software in connection with our online properties, including Beatport, ClubTix, Flavorus, and Paylogic. Some open source software licenses require those who distribute open source software as part of their own software product to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software product or make available any derivative works of the open source code on commercially unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we take reasonable measures to assess the use of open source software in certain of our online properties to attempt to ensure that we, and our predecessors, have not used open source software in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to our proprietary technology use, requiring such disclosure could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our online properties. Any claims by third parties seeking to enforce the terms of licenses to the open source code used in our technologies could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our software, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if the license terms for the open source code change, we may be forced to re-engineer our software or incur additional costs.\nRegulatory and business practice developments relating to personal information of our customers and fans and/or failure to adequately protect the personal information of our customers and fans may adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information. This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, and payment account information. We are in the process of evaluating the information collected in our business to understand if we can aggregate and reuse the contact information to inform these individuals of upcoming events, offerings and other products and services that we believe enhance the fan experience. Data protection laws and regulation may impair or prohibit our ability to use these data in such ways. The use of such customer information is a significant part of our growth strategy. The collection, storage and use of customer information is subject to regulation in many jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, and this regulation is becoming more prevalent and stringent. Furthermore, there is a risk that data protection regulators may seek jurisdiction over our activities even in locations in which we do not have an operating entity. This may arise in a number of ways, either because we are conducting direct marketing activities in a particular jurisdiction that the local laws apply to and are enforceable against us, or because one of our databases is controlling the processing of information within that jurisdiction. We are developing but have not yet finalized a comprehensive policy aimed at ensuring adequate protection of our customers' and fans' personal information and our compliance with applicable law. There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully adopt and implement this policy, which may give rise to liabilities or increased costs. In addition, we could face liability if the third parties to which we grant access to our customer data were to misuse or expose it. Our current privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on our websites. Any failure by us or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nInternational regulatory bodies and individual countries are increasingly focused on online privacy matters, including the use of cookies and other information placed on users' Internet browsers or users' computing devices, regardless of the information contained within or referred to by the cookie. Cookies are text files that are saved onto a user's computer, and may contain both personal and anonymized information about the user, which can be accessed by scripts on websites. Many jurisdictions have begun to implement legislation requiring advertisers and digital media sources to allow users to set their cookie preferences. Specifically, in the European Union, this is now subject to national laws being introduced pursuant to Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications. The directive requires European Member States to implement legislation and regulations requiring digital media sources to provide specific types of notice and obtain users' explicit, affirmative consent to the use of cookies or similar technologies. The laws being introduced pursuant to this measure are not finalized in every European Member State, and we have not determined what effect this could have on our business when we place cookies on the user's computer or when our third party marketing partners do so. Most major internet browsers, including Mozilla's Firefox, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Google Chrome now allow users to block all third-party cookies. Safari, Apple's internet browser, automatically blocks all third-party cookies by default. Other prevalent internet browsers may choose to amend their software in a similar manner. The effect may be to limit the amount of information we receive in relation to each use of the service and/or to limit our ability to link this information to a unique identity, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nEven where a particular data collection, storage or use practice is not specifically prohibited by any privacy law, governmental authorities and consumer protection groups, such as U.S. state attorneys general, the U.K. Advertising Standards Authority or the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Officer may take action against such practices, including under broad consumer protection laws in the United States. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") is starting to exercise greater authority over how online consumer data is collected and maintained by businesses. Prompted by the FTC's recommendation regarding online tracking, a number of federal legislative proposals have been introduced that would allow users to opt out of online monitoring that could prohibit the use of non-personal data of any user who implements a \"do-not-track\" setting on his browser. A number of states have passed similar legislation and some states, including California, are becoming more active in enforcing these laws to protect consumers. As of January 1, 2014, the California Online Privacy Protection Act or \"CalOPPA\" was amended to require companies to make more detailed disclosures in their privacy policies about their tracking activities and how they treat \"do-not-track\" signals in browser settings.\nThe laws in this area are complex and developing rapidly. For instance, we are aware that there is a proposal for a new general law within Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, which is likely to be introduced within three years. The proposed regulation is still under discussion, and we have not yet assessed the full effect of these proposals if enacted into law in their current form. There is a risk that internet browsers, operating systems or other applications might be modified by their developers in response to proposed legislation to limit or block our ability to access information about our users. It is possible that existing or future regulations could make it difficult or impossible for us to collect or use our customer information in the way we would like which would impede our growth strategy and potentially reduce the revenue we hope to generate. It is also possible that we could be found to have violated regulations relating to customer data, which could result in us being sanctioned, suffering fines or other punishment, being restricted in our activities and/or suffering reputational harm. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may be subject to disruptions, failures or cyber-attacks in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our businesses. Techniques used to gain unauthorized access to private networks are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to data pertaining to our customers, including credit card and debit card information and other personally identifiable information. Like all Internet services, our festival websites and the Beatport, Paylogic, Flavorus and Clubtix services, which are supported by our own systems and those of third-party vendors, are vulnerable to computer viruses, Internet worms, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload servers with denial- of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our and third-party vendor computer systems, any of which could lead to system interruptions, delays or shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized access to personally identifiable information. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs to our systems or a vendor's systems, we may face civil liability and public perception of our security measures could be diminished, either of which would negatively affect our ability to attract customers, which in turn would harm our efforts to attract and retain advertisers. In addition, security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets. We also would be required to expend significant resources to mitigate the breach of security and to address related matters.\nFurther, a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers including the systems and data centers of our third-party vendors as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, our ability to integrate, expand, and update our information technology infrastructure is important for our contemplated growth, and any failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot fully control the actions of third parties who may have access to the customer data we collect and the customer data collected by our third-party vendors. The ongoing integration of our digital services with applications provided by third parties represents a significant growth opportunity for us, but we may not be able to control such third parties' use of customer data. We may be unable to monitor or control such third parties and the third-parties having access to our other websites in their compliance with the terms of our privacy policies, terms of use, and other applicable contracts, and we may be unable to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, customer information. Any such misuse could hinder or prevent our efforts with respect to growth opportunities and could expose us to liability or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, these third parties may become the victim of security breaches or have practices that may result in a breach, and we could be responsible for those third party acts or failures to act.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us or the prior owners of acquired businesses to maintain the security of data relating to our customers and employees, to comply with our posted privacy policies, our predecessors' posted policies, laws and regulations, rules of self-regulatory organizations, industry standards and contractual provisions to which we or they may be bound, could result in the loss of confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others, all of which could result in litigation and financial losses, and could potentially cause us to lose customers, advertisers, sponsors, revenue and employees.\nWe depend on our ability to lease venues for our events, and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms, or at all, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business requires access to venues to generate revenue from live EMC events. For these events, we generally lease and operate a number of venues or locations under various agreements\nwhich include leases or licenses with third-parties or booking agreements, which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue or location for a specific period of time. Some of the leases we enter into may be between us and governmental entities. Our long-term success will depend in part on the availability of venues, our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration. As many of these agreements are with third-parties over whom we have little or no control, including the government, we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all. We may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues, which poses a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 desirable sites for live music events may be unavailable or costly;\n\u2022 the attractiveness of our venues and locations may deteriorate over time;\n\u2022 our competitors may outbid us for the use of certain venues and locations;\n\u2022 we may be unable to obtain or we may lose local government permits or approvals necessary to use a particular venue or location; and\n\u2022 a particular venue or location, including one we have used in the past, may determine that events or festivals like ours would be inappropriate for their property.\nWe may depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some services at our events and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business.\nCertain of the employees at some of the venues we manage and other independent contractors hired to assist at our festivals and events may be subject to collective bargaining agreements. The applicable union agreements typically expire and may require negotiation in the ordinary course of business. Upon the expiration of any such collective bargaining agreements, however, our partners may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating such collective bargaining agreements. In addition, our business operations at one or more of our venues may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though there is not unionized labor at that venue currently. A work stoppage at one or more of our owned and/or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business.\nWe have had a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have never been profitable. We experienced net losses attributable to SFX of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $110.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, and $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect we will continue to incur net losses in 2015 and significant future expenses as we develop and expand our business. In addition, as a public company with international operations, we incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses. These increased expenditures will make it harder for us to achieve and maintain future profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unsuccessful acquisitions, costs of integrating new businesses, expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nSome of our stockholders have repurchase rights that require us to purchase their shares of common stock under certain conditions, and our financial position would be adversely impacted if these stockholders exercise those rights.\nAs described below, as of March 10, 2015, some of our stockholders have repurchase rights with respect to their shares.\nIn addition, we granted to the former owners of MMG a put right exercisable at any time between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2015 to require us to acquire their 20% non-dilutable interest in our subsidiary, SFX-Nightlife Operating LLC. This right was exercised on January 16, 2015. On January 30, 2015, we made an advance payment of $1.3 million to the former owners of MMG, with the remaining balance due on or before April 30, 2015. The aggregate consideration to be paid by us upon exercise of the put right is equal to 20% of the product of SFX-Nightlife Operating LLC's EBITDA for the 2014 fiscal year multiplied by six.\nIf any of these holders of our shares of common stock exercise their repurchase rights, we may not have sufficient cash reserves to pay the amounts due. Even if we are able to pay these amounts, the payment may impede our ability to fund other aspects of our business, which would adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock and notes.\nWe may be required to make earnout payments to the sellers of businesses that we have acquired if those businesses achieve earnout thresholds and, as a result, our financial position may be adversely impacted if we make such payments.\nIn connection with certain of our completed acquisitions, we may be required to make earnout payments in the form of cash and/or shares of our common stock to the sellers of certain acquired businesses if those businesses achieve earnout thresholds and even if the former owners are not employed by us, as described below:\n\u2022 The sellers of MMG are entitled to receive an earnout payment based on the EBITDA of the business and assets of SFX-Nightlife Operating LLC for the year ended December 31, 2014. If\nthis EBITDA equals or exceeds $5.3 million, the earnout payment will equal approximately (1) $5.1 million multiplied by (2) the actual EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014, divided by $5.3 million. If the EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014 is less than $5.3 million but exceeds approximately $3.4 million, the earnout payment will equal approximately (1) $4.2 million multiplied by (2) the difference between the actual EBITDA and $3.4 million divided by $1.9 million. If the EBITDA is equal to or less than $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, the sellers of MMG will not receive an earnout payment. Any earnout payment will be composed of 80% cash and 20% shares of our common stock at a price equal to a 30-day volume-weighted average closing price per share for a specified period prior to the payment date, if any, if our shares are then traded on any national securities exchange or the over-the-counter bulletin board.\n\u2022 The seller of Monumental is entitled to receive an earnout payment if the EBITDA of the business for fiscal year 2014 (capped at EUR 2.6 million) multiplied by eight (such product, the \"Product\") exceeds the total purchase price of EUR 14.0 million. In the event the Product exceeds the total purchase price, we will be required to pay the seller the difference between the Product and total purchase price, which payment will be paid approximately 79% in cash and 21% in shares of common stock of the Company. If the Product is equal to or less than the total purchase price, then no earnout payment will be due.\n\u2022 The sellers of Made are entitled to receive a cash earnout payment in 2018 in an amount equal to the greater of (i) (a) the product of ten multiplied by the greater of (1) the Final EBITDA, which is equal to the average net income of the festivals and other businesses of Made for each of the 2015, 2016 and 2017 fiscal years and (2) the median Final EBITDA, minus (b) $35.0 million, and (ii) $10.0 million. The earnout payments will be reduced by (i) 50% of any amounts reserved on our financial statements in connection with potential indemnification claims under the Made purchase agreement relating to the 2013 edition of the Electric Zoo Festival, and (ii) amounts due and payable in connection with (a) certain litigation involving the sellers and Made, (b) indemnification obligations of the sellers of Made under the Made purchase agreement and (c) working capital adjustments under the Made purchase agreement in favor of us.\n\u2022 The sellers of Flavorus are entitled to receive an earnout payment equal to the amount that the EBITDA of Flavorus for its 2016 fiscal year multiplied by five exceeds, if at all, the $18.0 million purchase price (as adjusted post-closing with respect to the outstanding indebtedness and transaction expenses of Flavorus). If the EBITDA of Flavorus for its 2016 fiscal year multiplied by five is equal to or less than the adjusted purchase price, then the sellers of Flavorus will not receive an earnout payment. Any earnout payment will be composed of 75% cash and 25% shares of our common stock at a price equal to the 5-day volume-weighted average closing price per share for a specified period prior to the payment date, if any, if our shares are then publicly traded on any nationally recognized securities exchange. If our shares are not then publicly traded, then the earnout payment will be paid solely in cash. For purposes of calculating the earnout, Flavorus' EBITDA will be the greater of (i) Flavorus' earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and (ii) (1) for the first $22.0 million of Flavorus' net revenue, 18% of such net revenue, plus (2) for any net revenue of Flavorus that exceeds $22.0 million, 15% of any such excess.\n\u2022 The sellers of Teamwork are entitled to receive an earnout payment based on the EBITDA of the business of Teamwork for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016. The earnout payment will be equal to the amount by which (i) the product of (x) the average of (A) the EBITDA for calendar year 2015 and (B) the EBITDA for calendar year 2016, multiplied by (y) four is greater than, if at all, (ii) $9.3 million. The earnout payment, if any, will be payable as follows: (i) a portion in cash, as determined by the sellers in their sole discretion and\n(ii) the remainder in shares of our common stock at a price equal to the 5-day volume-weighted average closing price per share for a specified period prior to the payment date, if any.\n\u2022 The sellers of React are entitled to receive an earnout payment based on the EBITDA of the business of React for the year ended December 31, 2014. The earnout payment will be equal to (i) the product of (x) 6.25 multiplied by (y) the difference between (A) the adjusted EBITDA of React for 2014, minus (B) the adjusted EBITDA of React for 2012, minus (ii) any cash invested by us or our affiliates relating to new festivals or venues or other revenue-producing sources for the acquired business. Any earnout payment will be composed of 80% cash and 20% shares of our common stock at a price equal to the 30-day volume-weighted average closing price per share for a specified period prior to the payment date, if any, if our shares are then publicly traded on any nationally recognized securities exchange or the over-the-counter bulletin board. If our shares are not then publicly traded, then the price per share of our common stock will be determined in good faith by our board of directors.\nIf any of these earnout thresholds are met, we may not have sufficient cash reserves to pay the cash amount due to the sellers. If we are able to pay these cash amounts, the payment may impede our ability to fund other aspects of our business, which would adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock and notes.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman has the ability to substantially influence, if not control, all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of March 10, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, Robert F.X. Sillerman, beneficially owns shares of our common stock, in the aggregate, representing approximately 37.8% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, he has the ability to substantially influence, if not control, all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and as such, we will take advantage of certain modified disclosure requirements.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the listing requirements of NASDAQ and other applicable securities rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nHowever, we are an \"emerging growth company\" within the meaning of the rules under the Securities Act. For as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies generally, including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nWe would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of (1) the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (2) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more\nthan $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (4) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nIn addition, Section 107(b) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\") also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards as they become applicable to public companies.\nOur bylaws designate the state and federal courts in Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur bylaws provide, that, with certain limited exceptions, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of our company owed to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, our stockholders may only receive a return on investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. As a public company, we are currently required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. If in the future we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including at some of our acquired companies, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock and our notes could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and will incur even greater costs once we cease to be an emerging growth company, and our management must devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, on which our common stock is listed, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nPursuant to Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, and once we cease to be an emerging growth company, an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed time period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor, if and when required, our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nWe may face difficulty in integrating the operations of the businesses we have acquired.\nAcquisitions have been an important component of our growth strategy; however, we will need to integrate these acquired businesses successfully in order for our growth strategy to succeed and for us to become profitable. We may face difficulty with the integration of the businesses we acquire, such as coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business\nbackgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. Many of the businesses we acquire are not profitable and do not have sophisticated financial reporting systems in place, and we are relying on their adoption of our best practices to operate their businesses more efficiently to achieve and maintain profitability. However, we may fail in implementing our policies and procedures, or the policies and procedures may not be effective or provide the results we anticipate for a particular business. Furthermore, we will be relying on these policies and procedures in preparing our financial and other reports as a public company, so any failure of acquired businesses to properly adopt these policies and procedures could impair our public reporting. Management of the businesses we acquire may not have the operational or business expertise that we require to successfully implement our policies, procedures and best practices.\nA part of our growth strategy involves expanding our festivals and events into new markets. As a result, festivals and events from different businesses will be operating in similar geographic areas and in some cases at the same time of year, often for the first time, and these businesses will need to coordinate their strategies to avoid competing with each other for attendees or talent. If our acquired companies fail to integrate in these important ways, or we fail to adequately understand the business operations of our acquired companies, our growth and financial results will suffer.\nIn addition, our growth strategy also includes the further development of online properties that we intend to integrate across all of our acquired businesses. This will require, among other things, the integration of the individual websites and databases of each business we have or will acquire. This will be a complex undertaking that may prove more difficult, expensive and time consuming than we expect. Even if we are able to achieve this integration, it may not achieve the benefits we anticipate. If we fail to do this properly and in a timely manner, it could adversely affect our revenue and relationship with our fans.\nWe typically retain the management of the businesses we acquire and rely on them to continue running their businesses, which leaves us vulnerable in the event they leave our Company.\nWe seek to acquire businesses that have strong management teams that will continue to run the business after the acquisition. We often rely on these individuals to conduct the day-to-day operations of and pursue the growth of these acquired businesses. Although we typically seek to sign employment agreements with the managers of acquired businesses, it remains possible that these individuals will leave our organization. This would harm the prospects of the businesses they manage, potentially causing us to lose money on our investment and adversely affecting our growth and financial results.\nAny current or future joint ventures or minority investments will be subject to certain risks inherent in these investments.\nInvestments in joint ventures and minority investments involve certain unique risks, including, among others, risks relating to:\n\u2022 potential disagreements with our partner about how to manage the business;\n\u2022 the lack of full control of the venture's management, and therefore its actions;\n\u2022 the possibility that our partner might have or develop business interests or strategies that are contrary to ours;\n\u2022 the potential need for us to fund future capital to the business as loans to the business, as capital contributions to the joint venture, or otherwise;\n\u2022 the possible financial distress or insolvency of our partner, which could lead to our having to contribute its share of additional capital to the business;\n\u2022 the cost of litigation or arbitration (including damage to reputation) in the event of a dispute with our partner;\n\u2022 negative business and financial performance of the business because of substantial disagreements with our partner; and\n\u2022 preemptive dissolution of the business because we or our partner choose, or become obligated, to acquire the equity interests of the other in the business.\nOur substantial indebtedness and lease obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2014, we had $295.0 million principal amount of outstanding notes and $30.0 million of undrawn availability under our $30.0 million revolving credit facility, subject to certain limitations. The level of our indebtedness, our lease obligations and our equity repurchase obligations and potential earnout payments could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service and lease payments and make certain equity repurchase payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or general corporate purposes or make such financing more costly;\n\u2022 impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry in which we operate or the economy generally;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain competitors that have proportionately less debt; and\n\u2022 restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or pursuing business opportunities.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including under our notes and our revolving credit facility. If we are unable to meet our debt service and lease payment obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nIn addition to our substantial indebtedness, we have granted certain repurchase rights to certain holders of our common stock. For a summary of these repurchase rights, see \"Some of our stockholders have repurchase rights that require us to purchase their shares of common stock under certain conditions, and our financial position would be adversely impacted if these stockholders exercise those rights\" elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness.\nSubject to the restrictions in the indenture governing our notes and our revolving credit facility, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the indenture governing our 9.625% notes and our revolving credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these\nrestrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks associated with our already substantial indebtedness would increase.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and meet our other cash needs, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or repay or refinance our debt obligations and to fund our operations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, competitive, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future sources of capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to serve our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations and fund our operations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Additionally, we may not be able to consummate asset dispositions or obtain the proceeds that we expect to realize from them, and any proceeds received may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. The terms of the indenture governing our notes, the revolving credit facility and any future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the indenture governing our notes and our revolving credit facility, contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing our notes and our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur additional debt or issue preferred shares;\n\u2022 pay dividends, make any distribution in respect of, redeem or repurchase stock or make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with certain affiliates;\n\u2022 incur liens;\n\u2022 create or allow restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022 apply proceeds from certain asset sales or events of loss;\n\u2022 designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022 consolidate or merge with or into other entities or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nAfter a borrowing thereunder, our revolving credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios subject to certain conditions. Any or all of these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions and other corporate opportunities or to fund our operations. Any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those imposed under our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any of the collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our debt obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot provide assurance that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.", "PERMNO": 14261, "SIC": 7900, "TIC": "SFXEQ"}
