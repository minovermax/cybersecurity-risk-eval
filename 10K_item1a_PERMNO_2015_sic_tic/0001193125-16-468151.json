{"cik": "1024657", "company": "WEST CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive industries, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition in many of the markets in which we do business and expect that this competition will intensify. The principal competitive factors in our business are range of service offerings, global capabilities and price and quality of services. The trend toward international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuous technological changes may erode profits by bringing new competitors into our markets and reducing prices. Our competitors\u2019 products, services and pricing practices, as well as the timing and circumstances of the entry of additional competitors into our markets, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face technological advances, which have contributed to pricing pressures in the conferencing industry and could result in the loss of customer relationships. Competition in the web and video conferencing services arenas continues to increase as new vendors enter the marketplace and offer a broader range of collaboration solutions through new technologies, including, without limitation, VoIP, on-premise, PBX, unified communications equipment and mobile solutions.\nWe also face risks from technological advances that we may not be able to successfully address. Some of our competitors have substantially greater personnel and financial resources than we do.\nThere are services that are experiencing pricing declines. If we are unable to offset pricing declines through increased transaction volume and greater efficiency, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third parties for certain services we provide and increases in the cost of voice and data services or significant interruptions in these services could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on voice and data services provided by various telecommunications providers. Because of this dependence, any change to the telecommunications market that would disrupt these services or limit our ability to obtain services at favorable rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we have entered into long-term contracts with many of our telecommunications providers, there is no obligation for these vendors to renew their contracts with us or to offer the same or lower rates in the future. In addition, these contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.\nAn adverse change in the pricing of voice and data services that we are unable to recover through price increases of our services, or any significant interruption in voice or data services, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the providers of telecommunications have outages it may have a material client impact. We may not have the contractual right to be indemnified for all harm caused by an outage of our carriers and we may not be able to move the traffic to alternative carriers.\nOur business depends on our ability to keep pace with our clients\u2019 needs for rapid technological change and systems availability.\nTechnology is a critical component of our business. We have invested in sophisticated and specialized computer and telephone technology and we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to continue to select, invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to remain competitive. Our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands. Introduction of new methods and technologies brings corresponding risks associated with effecting change to a complex operating environment and, in the case of adding third party services, results in a dependency on an outside technology provider. With respect to third party technology we use to support our services, some of which is provided by our competitors, the failure of such technology or the third party becoming unable or unwilling to continue to provide the technology could interfere with our ability to satisfy customer demands and may require us to make investments in a replacement technology, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth in our Unified Communications Services and Safety Services businesses depends in large part on continued deployment and adoption of emerging technologies.\nGrowth in our unified communications services business and our next generation 9-1-1 solution offering is largely dependent on customer acceptance of communications services over IP-based networks, which is still in its early stages. Continued growth depends on a number of factors outside of our control. Customers may delay adoption and deployment of IP communications solutions for several reasons, including available capacity on legacy networks, internal commitment to in-house solutions and customer attitudes regarding security, reliability and portability of IP-based solutions. In the Safety Services reportable segment, adoption may be hindered by, among other factors, continued reliance by customers on legacy systems, the complexity of implementing new systems and budgetary constraints. If customers do not deploy and adopt IP-based network solutions at the rates we expect, for these or other reasons, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, next generation 9-1-1 deployment introduces reliability challenges greater than those of our traditional 9-1-1 services. Outages may subject the Company to liability claims as well as governmental oversight and fines.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients, and the loss of one or more key clients would result in the loss of revenue.\nOur 100 largest clients by revenue accounted for approximately 44% of our total revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. If we fail to retain a significant amount of business from any of our significant clients, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For example, we announced in the third quarter of 2015 a large telecom services client would not be retained. Also, in the first quarter of 2014, we announced a large conferencing client would not be retained. The impact of these actions have negatively affected our operating results in 2014 and 2015.\nWe serve clients and industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation in recent years. Additional consolidation could occur in which our clients could be acquired by companies that do not use our services. The loss of any significant client would result in a decrease in our revenue and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSecurity and privacy breaches of the systems we use to protect personal data could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur databases contain personal data of our clients\u2019 customers, including credit card and healthcare information. Any security or privacy breach of these databases, whether from human error or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or accidental technical failure, could expose us to liability, increase our expenses relating to the resolution of these breaches and deter our clients from selecting our services. Certain of our client contracts do not contractually limit our liability for the loss of confidential information and our insurance may not cover the expected loss. Migration of emergency communications to IP-based infrastructure increases this risk. Our data security procedures may not effectively counter evolving security risks, address the security and privacy concerns of existing or potential clients or be compliant with federal, state, and local laws and regulations in all respects. For our international operations, we are obligated to implement processes and procedures to comply with local data privacy regulations. Any failures in our security and privacy measures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth in our Unified Communications Services and other new services may provide alternatives to our services which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur unified communications services and other new services and enhancements to existing services may compete with our current collaboration services. Continued growth in such emerging technologies may result in the availability of feature rich alternatives to our existing services with a more attractive pricing model. These developments could reduce the attractiveness to customers of our existing product offerings and reduce the price which we can receive from customers with respect to such services, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, primarily through disrupting our clients\u2019 businesses.\nUncertain and changing global economic conditions, including disruption of financial markets, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, primarily through disruptions of our clients\u2019 businesses. Higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of business generally adversely affect the level of demand for certain of our services. In addition, continuation or worsening of general market conditions in the United States, Europe or other markets important to our businesses may adversely affect our clients\u2019 level of spending, ability to obtain financing for purchases and ability to make timely payments to us for our services, which could require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, negatively impact our days sales outstanding and adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause we have operations in countries outside of the United States, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting these countries that could result in increased operating expenses and regulation.\nWe operate or rely upon businesses in numerous countries outside the United States. We may expand further into additional countries and regions. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including the following:\n\u2022\ndata privacy laws that may apply to the transmission of our clients\u2019 and employees\u2019 data to the United States;\n\u2022\nburdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements, including data protection requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\naccounting (including managing internal control over financial reporting in our non-U.S. subsidiaries), tax and legal complexities arising from international operations;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in transferring funds generated overseas to the United States in a tax efficient manner;\n\u2022\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and collection difficulties;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and other parts of the world;\n\u2022\ndifferences between the rules and procedures associated with handling public safety in the United States and those related to IP public safety originated outside of the United States; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nIf we cannot manage our international operations successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue and net income attributed to foreign subsidiaries.\nWe conduct business in countries outside of the United States. Revenue and expense from our foreign operations are typically denominated in local currencies, thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Revenue and profit generated by our international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Adverse changes to foreign exchange rates could decrease the value of revenue we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business. Generally, we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency transactions.\nOur contracts generally are not exclusive and typically do not provide for revenue commitments.\nContracts for many of our services generally enable our clients to unilaterally terminate the contract or reduce transaction volumes upon written notice and without penalty, in many cases based on our failure to attain certain service performance levels. The terms of these contracts are often also subject to renegotiation at any time. In addition, most of our contracts are not exclusive and do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue. Many of our clients also retain multiple service providers with whom we must compete. As a result, the profitability of each client program may fluctuate, sometimes significantly, throughout the various stages of a program.\nPending and future litigation may divert management\u2019s time and attention and result in substantial costs of defense, damages or settlement, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face uncertainties related to pending and potential litigation. We may not ultimately prevail or otherwise be able to satisfactorily resolve this litigation. In addition, other material suits by individuals or certified classes, claims, or investigations relating to our business may arise in the future. Furthermore, we generally indemnify our clients against third-party claims asserting intellectual property violations and data security breaches, which may result in litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any of these lawsuits or any future actions, claims or investigations relating to the same or any other subject matter, we may incur substantial defense costs and these actions may cause a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. Also, we may be required to alter our business practices or pay substantial damages or settlement costs as a result of these proceedings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Finally, certain of the outcomes of such litigation may directly affect our business model, and thus our profitability.\nOur technology and services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Intellectual property infringement claims would be time-consuming and expensive to defend and may result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.\nThird parties have asserted in the past and may assert claims against us in the future alleging that we are violating or infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. An adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party\u2019s patent, license alternative technology from another party or reduce or modify our product and service offerings. In addition, litigation is time-consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. Any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.\nThe United States Congress, the FCC, the FTC and the states and foreign jurisdictions where we provide services have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern personal privacy, the provision of telecommunication services, telephone solicitations, the provision of public safety services and data privacy. As a result, we may be subject to proceedings alleging violation of these rules and laws in the future. Additional rules and laws may regulate the pricing for our offerings or require us to modify our operations or service offerings in order to meet our clients\u2019 service requirements effectively, and these regulations may limit our activities or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance.\nThere are numerous state statutes and regulations governing telemarketing activities that do or may apply to us. For example, some states place restrictions on the methods and timing of telemarketing calls and require that certain mandatory disclosures be made during the course of a telemarketing call. Some states also require that telemarketers register in the state before conducting telemarketing business in the state. Such registration can be time-consuming and costly. Compliance with all federal and state telemarketing regulations is costly and time-consuming. In addition, notwithstanding our compliance efforts, any failure on our part to comply with the registration and other legal requirements applicable to companies engaged in telemarketing activities could have an adverse impact on our business. We could become subject to litigation by private parties and governmental bodies alleging a violation of applicable laws or regulations, which could result in damages, regulatory fines, penalties and possible other relief under such laws and regulations and the accompanying costs and uncertainties of such litigation and enforcement actions.\nIn addition, the FCC has adopted rules dictating the manner in which regulated service providers compensate each other for the termination of interstate, intrastate, and local traffic, as well as intercarrier compensation between wireline carriers and wireless providers. The rules adopted by the FCC provide for a multi-year transition to a national uniform terminating charge of zero, which is known as \u201cbill-and-keep.\u201d Carriers were required to cap all current rate elements as of December 29, 2011 and to begin reducing their termination and transport rates in annual steps, culminating with a bill-and-keep system by July 2018. In a Further Notice, the FCC is considering changes to rates charged for origination of toll-free traffic, which is a major type of traffic carried by West\u2019s subsidiary, West Telecom Services. There are initiatives by state regulators to address, and possibly reduce, intrastate access rates. We are unable to predict the outcome of these rulemaking efforts, and any resulting regulations could limit our ability to determine how we charge for our services and have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary information or technology.\nOur success depends in part upon our proprietary information and technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as on confidentiality procedures and non-compete agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights in each of our businesses. Third parties may infringe or\nmisappropriate our patents, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The steps we have taken to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology or client data may be insufficient to protect us, and we may be unable to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information. Any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights. In addition, because we operate in many foreign jurisdictions, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur data and operation centers are exposed to service interruption, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations depend on our ability to protect our data and operation centers against damage that may be caused by fire, natural disasters, pandemics, power failure, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, Trojan horses, other malware, failures of our software, acts of sabotage or terrorism, riots and other emergencies. In addition, for some of our services, we are dependent on outside vendors and suppliers who may be similarly affected. In the past, natural disasters such as hurricanes have caused significant employee dislocation and turnover in the areas impacted. If we experience temporary or permanent employee dislocation or interruption at one or more of our data or operation centers through casualty, operating malfunction, data loss, system failure or other events, we may be unable to provide the services we are contractually obligated to deliver. As a result, we may experience a reduction in revenue or be required to pay contractual damages to some clients or allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts. Failure of our infrastructure due to the occurrence of a single event may have a disproportionately large impact on our business results. Any interruptions of this type could result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide our services to our clients, and our business interruption and property insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur. These interruptions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover significant portions of the losses.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key personnel. Our inability to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on the experience and continuing efforts and abilities of our management team and on the management teams of our operating subsidiaries. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A large portion of our operations also require specially trained employees. From time to time, we must recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate in order to keep pace with our clients\u2019 demands and our resulting need for specially trained employees. If we are unable to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries, or the costs incurred to do so, could harm our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was $77.7 million. From time to time we may seek to repatriate funds held by these subsidiaries, and our ability to withdraw cash from foreign subsidiaries will depend upon the results of operations of these subsidiaries and may be subject to legal, contractual or other restrictions and other business considerations. Our foreign subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that limit their ability to make loans or other payments to fund payments of our debt. In addition, dividend and interest payments to us from our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to\nforeign withholding taxes, which could reduce the amount of funds we receive from our foreign subsidiaries. Dividends and other distributions from our foreign subsidiaries may also be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and legal and other restrictions on repatriation, which could further reduce the amount of funds we receive from our foreign subsidiaries.\nIn general, when an entity in a foreign jurisdiction repatriates cash to the United States, the amount of such cash is treated as a dividend taxable at current U.S. tax rates. Accordingly, upon the distribution of cash to us from our foreign subsidiaries, we will be subject to U.S. income taxes. Although foreign tax credits may be available to reduce the amount of the additional tax liability, these credits may be limited based on our tax attributes. Therefore, to the extent that we use cash generated in foreign jurisdictions, there may be a cost associated with repatriating cash to the United States or other limitations that could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIf we are unable to complete future acquisitions or if we incur unanticipated acquisition liabilities, our business strategy and earnings may be negatively affected.\nOur ability to identify and take advantage of attractive acquisitions or other business development opportunities is an important component in implementing our overall business strategy. We may be unable to identify, finance or complete acquisitions or to do so at attractive valuations.\nIn addition, we incur significant transaction costs associated with our acquisitions, including substantial fees for attorneys, accountants and other advisors. Any acquisition could result in our assumption of unknown and/or unexpected, and perhaps material, liabilities. Additionally, in any acquisition agreement, the negotiated representations, warranties and agreements of the selling parties may not entirely protect us, and liabilities resulting from any breaches could exceed negotiated indemnity limitations. These factors could impair our growth and ability to compete; divert resources from other potentially more profitable areas, or otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to integrate or achieve the objectives of our acquisitions, our overall business may suffer.\nOur business strategy depends on successfully integrating the assets, operations and corporate functions of businesses we have acquired and any additional businesses we may acquire in the future. The acquisition of additional businesses involves integration risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from operating our business to acquisition and integration challenges;\n\u2022\nthe unanticipated loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger company at businesses that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate accounting, information management, human resources, contract and intellectual property management and other administrative systems at each business to permit effective management; and\n\u2022\nour entry into markets or geographic areas where we may have limited or no experience.\nWe may be unable to effectively or efficiently integrate businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future without encountering the difficulties described above. Failure to integrate these businesses effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to this integration risk, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to achieve the planned objectives of an acquisition including cost savings and synergies. The inability to achieve our planned objectives could result from:\n\u2022\nthe financial underperformance of these acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key clients of the acquired business, which may drive financial underperformance;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel at the acquired company; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of unanticipated liabilities or contingencies for which we are unable to receive indemnification from the prior owner of the business.\nPotential future impairments of our substantial goodwill, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1.9 billion and $370.0 million, respectively. Management is required to exercise significant judgment in identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition and general economic conditions. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\u201d Any changes in key assumptions about the business units and their prospects or changes in market conditions or other externalities could result in an impairment charge, and such a charge could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions, which may not be successful, to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2015, our aggregate long-term indebtedness, including the current portion, was $3,400.1 million. In 2015, our consolidated interest expense and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs was approximately $156.6 million. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our other liquidity needs depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot make assurances that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or the payment of dividends, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot make assurances that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facilities or the indenture that governs our outstanding notes. Our senior secured credit facilities documentation and the indenture that governs the notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. As a result, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or use the proceeds to meet our debt service or other obligations, and any proceeds that are available may not be adequate to meet any debt service or other obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default of such debt and, as a result:\n\u2022\nour debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nour debt holders under other debt subject to cross default or cross acceleration provisions could declare all outstanding principal and interest on such other debt to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur current or future indebtedness could impair our financial condition and reduce the funds available to us for other purposes, including dividend payments, and our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured credit facilities documentation or the indenture that governs our outstanding notes could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur current or future indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development, general corporate purposes, refinancing of our existing obligations or other purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities or other purposes;\n\u2022\nthe debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nbecause we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, our debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nour leverage will increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand adverse events in our business by limiting our financial alternatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and to plan for, or respond to, competition and changes in our business may be limited; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to declare or pay dividends.\nOur debt agreements contain, and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain, financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt, including to finance future operations or other capital needs, and to engage in other activities that we may believe are in our long-term best interests, including to dispose of or acquire assets. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness or result in modifications to our credit terms. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and we may not be able to continue our operations as planned.\nWe had a negative net worth as of December 31, 2015, which may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain financing in the future and may otherwise negatively impact our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had a negative net worth of $552.1 million. Our negative net worth primarily resulted from the incurrence of indebtedness to finance our Recapitalization in 2006. As a result of our negative net worth, we may face greater difficulty and expense in obtaining future financing than we would face if we had a greater net worth, which may limit our ability to meet our needs for liquidity or otherwise compete effectively in the marketplace.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels and the restrictive covenants set forth in agreements governing our indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. Incurring additional indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nSubject to the restrictions in our debt agreements, we and certain of our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness. Although the terms of our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be\nsignificant. At December 31, 2015, under the terms of our debt agreements, we would be permitted to incur up to approximately $575.2 million of additional committed term loan debt or increase commitment to the revolving credit facility, or incur debt by our foreign subsidiaries up to $250 million, all in addition to any current availability that is undrawn as of December 31, 2015 under our revolving credit facility and asset securitization facility. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we face could increase.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flows or have sufficient restricted payment capacity under our senior secured credit facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes to pay our intended dividends on the common stock.\nSubject to legally available funds, we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends. We will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand and funds generated by us and our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will be subject to the terms of our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the outstanding notes. Our operating cash flow and ability to comply with restricted payments covenants in our debt instruments will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and our Board of Directors could affect our dividend policy, decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. The following additional factors, among others, could affect our dividend policy:\n\u2022\nwe are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nwhile we currently intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend, the actual amount of dividends distributed and the decision to make any distribution is entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors and future dividends with respect to shares of our capital stock, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant;\n\u2022\nthe amount of dividends distributed is and will be subject to contractual restrictions under the restricted payments covenants contained in:\n\u2022\nthe indenture governing our outstanding notes,\n\u2022\nthe terms of our senior secured credit facilities,\n\u2022\nthe terms of any other outstanding indebtedness we may incur; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of dividends distributed is subject to state law restrictions.\nAs a result of the foregoing limitations on our ability to pay dividends, we cannot assure you that we will be able to make all of our intended quarterly dividend payments.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions, in some cases that were adopted by our Board of Directors for the purpose of increasing the likelihood that a proposed acquisition is fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders, that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause;\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to engage in certain business combinations with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (other than the Sponsors, Gary and Mary West, their affiliates and certain transferees) for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our Board of Directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our Board of Directors then in office.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or second amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIn addition, our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding notes contain customary \u201cchange of control\u201d provisions which could have the effect of increasing the cost of acquiring the Company and therefore may discourage such an acquisition or reduce the price a buyer would be willing to pay to our stockholders in an acquisition.\nFuture sales of our common stock may lower our stock price.\nIf any of our significant stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, the perception in the public market that our significant stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock, regardless of the actual plans of those stockholders.\nOur principal stockholders possess significant influence over us. Their interests may not coincide with other stockholders and they may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree.\nEntities controlled by Gary L. West and Mary E. West, the Gary and Mary West Health Institute and investment funds associated with the Sponsors own, in the aggregate, approximately 47% of our outstanding common stock. Under our amended and restated stockholder agreement with our Sponsors and entities controlled with our Founders, our Sponsors can designate up to five directors, in the aggregate, to our Board of Directors, subject to ownership of our common stock above certain thresholds. Because our Chief Executive Officer will be appointed, and may be terminated, by our Board of Directors, our Sponsors could effectively have the ability to select our Chief Executive Officer through the designation of directors, subject to ownership of our common stock above a certain threshold. As a result, these stockholders, acting individually or together, could control substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of most directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interest of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that other stockholders would not approve or make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities, which could adversely affect our business or prospects.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to the Sponsors or any of their officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than West and its subsidiaries) and that may be a business opportunity for such Sponsor, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person shall be liable to us for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person, acting in good faith, pursues or acquires any such business opportunity, directs any such business opportunity to another person or fails to present any such business opportunity, or information regarding any such business opportunity, to us unless, in the case of any such person who is our director or officer, any such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer. None of the Sponsors shall have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or any of our subsidiaries.\nThese provisions apply subject only to certain ownership requirements of the Sponsors and other conditions. For example, our Sponsors may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or ideas for product line expansions, and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to the Sponsors could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by the Sponsors for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nDivestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nOn March 3, 2015, we divested certain of our agent-based businesses. In connection with the sale we agreed to indemnify the buyer, up to the full purchase price of $275.0 million, with respect to the equity interests of the companies we sold, title to the equity and assets sold and the authority of the Company to sell the equity and assets. The Company has also agreed to indemnify the buyer for breaches of other representations and warranties in the purchase agreement for up to $13.75 million in losses, and for certain other matters.", "PERMNO": 84283, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "WSTC"}
