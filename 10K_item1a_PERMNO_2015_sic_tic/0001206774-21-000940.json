{"cik": "6494", "company": "ANDREA ELECTRONICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAndrea is a party to the Revenue Sharing Agreement under which a perpetual predetermined share of its Monetization Revenues will be allocated to AND34 and under which a default could cause a material adverse effect on its financial position.\nUnder the Revenue Sharing Agreement that we entered into with AND34, Monetization Revenues will first be applied 100% to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on, and then will be allocated to AND34 and the Company in accordance with certain predetermined percentages. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $200,000 of notes payable were issued to AND34. At December 31, 2020, there was $2,093,967 of accrued and unpaid interest and related outstanding principal notes issued to AND34. The Revenue Sharing Agreement contains many stipulations between the parties regarding the handling of various matters related to the monetization of our patents. Following an Event of Default, under the Revenue Sharing Agreement and the Rider, AND34 may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit or other appropriate proceeding, either for specific performance or in aid of the exercise of any power granted under the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Rider or ancillary documents including the notes.\nAndrea is limited in its ability to get traditional funding.\nThe terms of the Revenue Sharing Agreement historically expressly prohibited the Company from incurring any other indebtedness in connection with the patents covered by the Revenue Sharing Agreement and collateral outside of the patents covered by the Revenue Sharing Agreement, barring certain exceptions. Such restrictions contained in the Revenue Sharing Agreement terminated on June 30, 2020 and no longer prohibit the Company from incurring additional indebtedness. However, in order to incur third party indebtedness, the Company would need to offer some form of collateral and currently much of the Company\u2019s intellectual property is serving as collateral in connection with the Revenue Sharing Agreement. In addition, the conversion price adjustment provisions of the Company\u2019s Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and the current low quotation price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the OTCQB limit our ability to get traditional funding.\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuation; period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically been and are subject to continued substantial annual and quarterly fluctuations. The causes of these fluctuations include, among other things:\n\u25cf the volume of sales of our products under our collaborative marketing arrangements;\n\u25cf the cost of development of our products;\n\u25cf the mix of products we sell;\n\u25cf the mix of distribution channels we use;\n\u25cf the timing of our new product releases and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the computer and communications hardware and software marketplace; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that the level of revenues and gross profit, if any, that we achieve in any particular fiscal period will not be significantly lower than in other fiscal periods. Our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1,355,000 and $1,895,000, respectively. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $824,000, or $0.01 net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis, versus net loss of approximately $549,000, or $0.01 net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2019. We continue to explore opportunities to grow sales in other business areas and vigorously defend and monetize our intellectual property.\nShares eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on market price; Andrea shareholders may experience substantial dilution.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could have the effect of depressing the prevailing market price of our common stock. Of the 200,000,000 shares of common stock presently authorized, 68,104,957 were outstanding as of March 23, 2021. The number of shares outstanding does not include an aggregate of 20,454,812 shares of common stock that are issuable. This number of issuable common shares is equal to approximately 30% of the 68,104,957 outstanding shares. These issuable common shares are comprised of: a) 6,301,500 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding awards granted under our 2006 Stock Plan; b) 10,000,000 shares reserved for future grants under our 2019 Plan; c) 524,736 shares of common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and related accrued dividends; and d) 3,628,576 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock.\nConversions of our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock may result in substantial dilution to other holders of our common stock.\nAs of March 23, 2021, we had 11.469249 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 907,144 shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock is limited to that amount which, after giving effect to the conversion, would cause the holder not to beneficially own in excess of 4.99% or, together with other shares beneficially owned during the 60-day period prior to such conversion, not to beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock. The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock also is limited to that amount which, after giving effect to the conversion, would cause the holder not to beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, except that each holder has a right to terminate such limitation upon 61 days\u2019 notice to us. Beneficial ownership for purposes of calculation of such percentage limitations does not include shares whose acquisition is subject to similar limitations. If all shares of the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, which are outstanding to be issued, are assumed to be converted into or exercised for shares of common stock, the number of new shares of common stock required to be issued as a result would aggregate 4,153,312 shares, which is equal to approximately 6% of the 68,104,957 outstanding shares.\nIf we conduct offerings in the future, the price at which we offer our securities may trigger a price protection provision for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock.\nThe shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock are subject to antidilution provisions, which are triggered in the event of certain stock splits, recapitalizations, or other dilutive transactions. In addition, issuances of common stock at a price below the conversion price then in effect (currently $0.2551 and $0.25 for the Series C and Series D, respectively), or the issuance of warrants, options, rights, or convertible securities which have an exercise price or conversion price less than that conversion price, other than for certain previously outstanding securities and certain \u201cexcluded securities\u201d (as defined in the certificate of amendment), require the adjustment of the conversion price to that lower price at which shares of common stock have been issued or may be acquired. In the event that Andrea issues securities in the future which have a conversion price or exercise price which varies with the market price and the terms of such variable price are more favorable than the conversion price in the Series C or Series D Preferred Stock, the purchasers may elect to substitute the more favorable variable price when making conversions of the Series C or Series D Preferred Stock. This would make it more likely that the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock would be converted into common stock, resulting in dilution to our other holders of common stock as outlined in the risk factor above.\nShort sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany conversions of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, which sales may cause downward pressure upon the price of our common stock.\nShort sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany the sale of converted common stock, which in the aggregate could cause downward pressure upon the price of the common stock, regardless of our operating results, thereby attracting additional short sales of the common stock.\nIf we fail to commercialize and fully market our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products, our total revenues may not increase at a high enough rate to improve our results of operations or may not increase at all.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition depend on the successful commercialization of our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products and technologies. We introduced our first Andrea DSP Microphone products in 1998 and we continued to introduce complementary products and technologies over the last several years. We primarily target the computer market, the audio and video conferencing markets and the market for in-vehicle computing, among others. The success of these products is subject to the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of product commercialization, particularly companies in the computing and communications industries.\nIf we are unable to obtain market acceptance of Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products and technologies, or if market acceptance of these products and technologies occurs at a slow rate, then our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe, and our competitors, are focused on developing and commercializing products and technologies that enhance the use of voice, particularly in noisy environments, for a broad range of computer and communications applications. These products and technologies have been rapidly evolving and the number of our competitors has grown, but the markets for these products and technologies are subject to a high level of uncertainty and have been developing slowly. We, alone or together with our industry, may be unsuccessful in obtaining market acceptance of these products and technologies.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and technologies in response to competition and evolving technology, we may not be able to attract new customers or retain current customers.\nThe markets in which we sell our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products are highly competitive. We may not compete successfully with any of our competitors. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, research and development, marketing, technical support and other resources than we do. Consequently, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, marketing, and sale of their products than we can. The introduction of products incorporating new technologies could render our products obsolete and unmarketable and could exert price pressures on existing products.\nWe are currently engaged in the development of digital signal processing products and technologies for the voice, speech and natural language interface markets. We may not succeed in developing these new digital signal processing products and technologies, and any of these new digital signal processing products or technologies may not gain market acceptance.\nFurther, the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by evolving industry and government standards and specifications that may require us to devote substantial time and expense to adapt our products and technologies. For example, certain of our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products are subject to the Federal Communications Commission requirements. We may not successfully anticipate and adapt our products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner to changes in technology and industry standards or to introductions of new products and technologies by others that render our then existing products and technologies obsolete.\nIf our marketing collaborators do not effectively market their products that include or incorporate our products, our sales growth will be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into collaborative and distribution arrangements with software publishers and computer hardware manufacturers relating to the marketing and sale of Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products through inclusion or incorporation with the products of our collaborators. Our success is dependent to a substantial degree on the efforts of these collaborators to market their products that include or incorporate our products. Our collaborators may not successfully market these products. In addition, our collaborators generally are not contractually obligated to any minimum level of sales of our products or technologies, and we have no control over their marketing efforts. Furthermore, our collaborators may develop their own microphone products and technologies that may replace our products or technologies or to which they may give higher priority.\nShortages of, or interruptions in, the supply of more specialized components for our products could have a material adverse effect on our sales of these products.\nThe majority of our assembly operations are fulfilled by subcontractors (primarily in Asia) using purchased components. Some specialized components for the Andrea DSP Microphone products, such as microphones and digital signal processing boards, are available from a limited number of suppliers (and in some cases foreign) and subject to long lead times. We may not be able to continue to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components, particularly if the sales of our products increase substantially or market demand for these components otherwise increases. If our subcontractors fail to meet our production and shipment schedules, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the United States.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the United States. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. If manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including but not limited to, natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete may be limited by our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property or by patents granted to third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, independent contractors, licensees and potential licensees, limited access to and dissemination of our proprietary information, and other measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. However, the steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent its misappropriation or circumvention. In addition, numerous patents have been granted to other parties in the fields of noise cancellation, noise reduction, computer voice recognition, digital signal processing and related subject matter. We expect that products in these fields will increasingly be subject to claims under these patents as the numbers of products and competitors in these fields grow and the functionality of products overlap. Claims of this type could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products or to develop new products and technologies, because the parties holding these patents may refuse to grant licenses or only grant licenses with onerous royalty requirements. Moreover, the laws of other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to our technologies to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, COVID-19 spread to other countries, including the United States, and efforts to contain the spread of this coronavirus intensified. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health measures were implemented across much of the United States, including the Long Island area, which was considered an epicenter of the outbreak and is where the Company is located. Due to \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health guidance measures, the Company had implemented a work-from-home policy for all staff members. The Company\u2019s increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation. Although the Company has not yet had any customers cancel any open orders, some customers have delayed shipments of products into future months, causing our 2020 product revenues through December 31, 2020 to be approximately $400,000 less than the same period in 2019.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak may affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as social distancing and quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and elsewhere, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and elsewhere to contain and treat the disease, including the speed of the ongoing vaccine distribution effort. Future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if there is a default on the Payment Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) Loans and/or the SBA Loan.\nThe Company entered into two PPP loans with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. in an aggregate principal amount of $285,552, pursuant to a program which was established under the CARES Act, whereby the Company received $142,775 in its first draw in May 2020 (the \u201cPPP Loan First Draw\u201d) and $142,777 in its second draw in February 2021 (the \u201cPPP Loan Second Draw\u201d and together with the PPP Loan First Draw, the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d). Under the terms of the CARES Act, recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for certain permissible purposes as set forth in the PPP, including, but not limited to, payroll costs (as defined under the PPP) and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs and the maintenance of employee and compensation levels. On January 18, 2021, the PPP Loan First Draw was forgiven, barring an initial $8,000 advance. No assurance is provided that the Company will obtain forgiveness of the remaining amount of the PPP Loan First Draw or any of the PPP Loan Second Draw; therefore, the Company may be liable for paying the outstanding balances of the PPP Loans back.\nThe PPP Loans contain customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults or breach of representations and warranties. If the PPP Loans are not forgiven, the Company may default on the PPP Loans and trigger the immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or the Lender filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company.\nAdditionally, the Company entered into the SBA Loan pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $150,000. The SBA Loan was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, which was a program expanded for COVID-19 relief under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The term of the SBA Loan is thirty (30) years with a maturity date of July 13, 2050 and the annual interest rate of the SBA Loan is a fixed rate of 3.75%. Under the terms of the CARES Act, the use of loan proceeds for the SBA Loan is limited to alleviating economic injury caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the SBA Loan for such purpose.\nWhile the SBA Loan does not allow for forgiveness like the PPP Loans, there are similar risks of default for the SBA Loan.\nAn unfavorable ruling in any current litigation proceeding or future proceeding may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation incidental to our business. For example, we are subject to the risk of adverse claims, interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, oppositions to patent applications outside the United States, and litigation alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation to establish the validity of patents, to assert infringement claims against others, and to defend against patent infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming, even if the outcome is in our favor.\nFor example, as discussed in Part II \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K, we are currently involved in appealing an unfavorable ruling by the ITC in our patent infringement claims against Apple Inc. In line with our business strategy, we have dedicated significant resources to vigorously prosecuting these patent infringement claims, and not succeeding on these claims could be detrimental to our Company.\nChanges in economic and political conditions outside the United States could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe generate revenues from regions outside the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total revenues from sales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 23% and 25%, respectively, of our total revenues. International sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf trade restrictions in the form of license requirements;\n\u25cf restrictions on exports and imports and other government controls;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs and taxes;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf problems in establishing and managing distributor relationships;\n\u25cf general economic conditions; and\n\u25cf political and economic instability or conflict.\nTo date, we have invoiced our international revenues in U.S. dollars and have not engaged in any foreign exchange or hedging transactions. We may not be able to continue to invoice all of our revenues in U.S. dollars in order to avoid engaging in foreign exchange or hedging transactions. If we are required to invoice any material amount of international revenues in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in the value of non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or require us to incur hedging costs to counter such fluctuations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and other personnel necessary for our business, then our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of any of these executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managers and technical personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to attract, motivate or retain qualified personnel in the future.\nWe have significantly less financial resources than most of our competitors which limits our ability to implement new products or enhancements to our current products and may require us to implement future restructuring plans, which could adversely affect our future sales and financial condition.\nFinancial resource constraints could limit our ability to execute our product strategy or require us to implement restructuring plans, particularly if we are unable to generate cash from operations or obtain additional sources of financing. Any future restructuring actions may slow our development of new or enhanced products by limiting our research and development and engineering activities. Our cash balances are also lower than those of our competitors, which may limit our ability to develop competitive new products on a timely basis. If we are unable to successfully introduce new or enhanced products, our sales and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nA significant amount of our business involves licensing our proprietary software, a strategy that increases business risk and volatility.\nWe have licensed certain of our proprietary software to third parties and may seek to enter into additional license arrangements in the future. We cannot assure you, however, that others will be interested in licensing our software on commercially favorable terms or at all. We also cannot ensure that licensees will honor agreed-upon market restrictions, not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property or maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information.", "PERMNO": 29073, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "ANDR"}
