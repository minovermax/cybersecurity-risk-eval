{"cik": "865415", "company": "ADEPT TECHNOLOGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operating results fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast, are often out of our control, and can be volatile.\nOur past operating results may not accurately indicate our future performance. Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and could fluctuate in the future. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations include:\n\u2022\nchanges in aggregate capital spending, cyclicality and other economic conditions, or demand in the industries we serve;\n\u2022\nimpact of our restructuring and cost-management activities on our operations;\n\u2022\nmanagement of our working capital;\n\u2022\nchanges in our products\u2019 market acceptance or demand;\n\u2022\nnew products or changes in pricing, by us, our distribution channels, or our competitors;\n\u2022\npricing and availability of components and raw materials;\n\u2022\nchanges in our product mix from quarter to quarter affecting our gross margins;\n\u2022\nour failure to manufacture a sufficient volume of products in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nour inability to decrease certain fixed costs and expenses to address changes in demand;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nshifts in geographic concentration of our sales;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our product offerings; and\n\u2022\nextraordinary events such as litigation, claims, information security breaches or mergers and acquisitions.\nWe generally recognize revenues upon shipment, or in certain cases upon receipt by customers. As a result, our revenues and results of operations are affected by the timing of orders received and shipped. A significant percentage of our shipments occur in the last month of each quarter, making reliable forecasting of demand level for our products for a particular quarter difficult. Further, an order cancellation, reduction or delay in shipments near the end of a fiscal period may cause sales to fall below expectations and harm our operating results for that period. We have and may also enter into agreements requiring us to accept certain orders meeting agreed criteria and to hold specified levels of inventory. To address this, we periodically stock inventory levels of completed robots, machine controllers and certain strategic components. As a result, our operating results vary, our stock price is volatile, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow in the past, and have limited liquidity resources, which could impair our ability to invest in growth and adversely affect our operations.\nWe have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow, and if our projected revenue fails to increase or our expenses exceed current expectations, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, adequately respond to competitive pressures or fully execute our business plan. In 2012, we raised approximately $3.1 million in connection with a public offering of common stock, $7.6 million of net proceeds in connection with our redeemable convertible preferred stock financing which has been fully converted into common stock and in June 2015, raised approximately $7.9 million of net proceeds in connection with a registered common stock offering. These financings increased our cash resources and allowed us to pay off outstanding balances under our line of credit, but our liquidity remains limited and restrictions and tax consequences may limit our\naccess to existing cash balances from our foreign operations. We have historically relied on our line of credit and funds generated from those financings and operating activities to sustain and grow our business. We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital on favorable terms, it could undermine our ability to pursue expansion opportunities and could limit the working capital available to our business, harming our operating results.\nOur restructuring and cost-management efforts may not be effective, might have unintended consequences, and could negatively impact our business.\nWe have restructured our operations in response to changes in the economic environment, our industry and demand, including restructuring programs in the second quarters of fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to streamline operations, consolidate facilities and reduce our work force, and continue to manage costs in light of our revenue levels. We reviewed and aligned our strategic priorities and rebalanced our investments to maintain sufficient liquidity and to focus on growth in our core markets. Despite our planning, some cost-cutting measures could have unexpected negative consequences, including loss of key personnel, or the loss of customers.\nIn connection with our restructurings, we reduced our work force and experienced additional attrition, which may expose the Company to legal claims against the Company and loss of necessary human resources. If we face costly employee or contract termination claims, our operations and prospects could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to build and effectively integrate our new management team and sales and engineering teams, our business could be harmed.\nOur management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer and other non-executive officers have all worked with the Company for less than three years and we continue to expand our sales and engineering teams with new personnel. Integrating new management and technical personnel into existing operations always carries risk. If we are unable to effectively build our new management team or integrate our new team members, our operations and prospects could be harmed.\nWe depend on outsourced manufacturing and information technology capabilities and single source suppliers, and if we experience disruptions in this supply or prices increase, our business may suffer.\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing functions, and obtain many key components, materials and mechanical sub-systems from sole or single source suppliers. We have limited contracts or guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers, and the lack of alternate sources and lengthy qualification process for replacement suppliers involves significant risks. These risks include whether or not new suppliers will provide adequate quantities with sufficient quality on a timely basis, and the risk that supplier pricing may be higher than anticipated. If we are unable to obtain necessary items on a timely basis, at acceptable prices, and of sufficient quality, we could lose current or future business. In the past, we have experienced quality control or specification problems with certain components provided by sole source suppliers, and have had to design around flawed items. Any quality issues could result in customer dissatisfaction, lost sales, or increased warranty costs, and could harm our results of operations.\nAny significant price increase or disruption of our supply sources could interrupt our product shipments, require reengineering, and damage customer relationships. If our suppliers cease manufacturing components that we require, we may need to purchase a significant amount of inventory that could lead to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence. Finally, if we incorrectly forecast product mix for a particular period and we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of any components or mechanical sub-systems on a timely and cost-effective basis due to long procurement lead times, our business could be substantially impaired.\nGlobal economic conditions affecting our customers and suppliers may also negatively affect our financial results by decreasing our revenues and increasing our risk of credit-related losses.\nThe global economic downturn created a widespread slowdown in capital investment, manufacturing, and demand for consumer products particularly in the disk-drive and solar markets. In response, our suppliers have or may increase their prices or reduce their output. Some of our customers (including systems integrators) have, and may continue to, defer, reduce or cease to place orders for our products, or may delay or default on their payment obligations, reducing our revenues or increasing our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nOur inability to accurately forecast, or react quickly and adequately to increases or decreases in demand for our products could harm our business and results of operations.\nIntelligent automation systems using our products can range in price from $25,000 to $500,000. Accordingly, our success depends upon the capital expenditure budgets of our customers, which tend to be cyclical. The economic downturn during the Great Recession resulted in cutbacks in capital spending in some of our major markets, and our business has been, and may continue to be, negatively affected. Industry downturns have been characterized by reduced demand for devices and equipment, production over-capacity, and accelerated declines in average selling prices. During periods of declining demand, we previously implemented worldwide restructuring programs to realign our business and lower our expenses. However, our ability to reduce expenses is limited by our need to retain and motivate key employees, and by our need for continued investment in product engineering, research and development. We also have extensive ongoing customer service and support requirements, must maintain inventory to satisfy potential customer commitments, and have certain fixed administrative costs. Further, our failure to effectively manage product transitions or accurately forecast customer demand, in terms of both volume and configuration, may lead to an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory.\nWe also must maintain the ability to quickly increase our manufacturing capacity upon an increase in orders or general upturn in any of our markets. Typically, upturns in markets such as disk drive or electronics have been characterized by abrupt demand increases, and production under-capacity. We must be able to ramp up in times of increased demand and hire sufficiently to service our customers.\nOur international operations and reliance on foreign suppliers subject us to risks outside of our control that may harm our operating results.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, including a presence in Asia. A substantial majority of our revenue is derived from non-U.S. sales: international sales represented 80% and 77% of revenues for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. We expect that revenue from our international sales and operations will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue. We also purchase some critical components from foreign suppliers. As a result, our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales, purchases, and operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties ensuring compliance with applicable regulatory regimes;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical, military, and economic instability or turmoil;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions, such as tariff regulations and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ntransportation costs and delays;\n\u2022\nlocal rules favoring local business and organized labor;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivables from foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax rates and tax treatment of our intercompany transactions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty obtaining appropriate personnel.\nWe face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as a significant portion of our revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we make foreign currency-denominated purchases from some suppliers, and thus remain subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange movements between the date that the transactions are recorded and the date cash is paid. Continued fluctuations in foreign currencies could negatively impact us.\nAs we are subject to the regulatory regimes of numerous governments, we must ensure that our operations comply with all applicable requirements, including changing requirements affecting business and tax audits by foreign authorities. It is not possible to assess the associated amount of financial or operational exposure at this time.\nIn 2011, we opened a facility in Shanghai, China to capitalize on significant opportunities presented by the Asian markets. We face all the risks inherent in operating in a foreign emerging market where we have not previously operated a facility. Our China-based activities are subject to greater political, regulatory, legal and economic risks than those faced by other operations. There can be no assurance that our operations in China will be successful.\nThe long sales cycle, customer evaluation and implementation processes of our products may increase the costs of securing sales and reduce the predictability of our earnings.\nOur products are technologically complex, and prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate performance, and to install and integrate our products into larger systems. As a result, our sales process is often subject to evaluation and approval delays typically associated with large capital expenditures. The sales cycles for our products often last for months or years, and orders expected in one quarter may shift to another or be canceled because of a customer\u2019s budgetary constraints or internal acceptance reviews. Longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to secure sales that may not be realized in the short term, and therefore may delay or prevent revenue generation. The time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their system can also vary significantly, which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results.\nOur failure to keep up with rapid technological change and new product development would harm our ability to compete.\nThe intelligent automation industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements. We must anticipate trends in our customers\u2019 industries and develop products before our customers\u2019 products are commercialized, because many of our products are used by our customers to develop, manufacture, and test their own products. If we do not accurately predict our customers\u2019 needs, we may invest substantial development resources in products that do not achieve broad market acceptance. Further, if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products meeting customers\u2019 changing technical specifications on a timely and cost-effective basis, our products may become uncompetitive or obsolete. We also must make decisions about whether or not to develop and offer products to a given market, and if our judgment of that market is incorrect, our business could be harmed.\nThe market for intelligent automation products is intensely competitive, which may make it difficult to grow our business or to maintain or enhance our profitability.\nOur competitors include robot, motion control, machine vision, and simulation software companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do. Our competitors in the robot market also include integrated manufacturers that produce robotics equipment for internal use, and also compete with our products for sales to other customers. Because they can generate substantial unit volumes to satisfy internal demand, these competitors may have greater pricing flexibility. During the recent economic downturn, we experienced aggressive price reductions and other accommodations by our competitors, in addition to increased price sensitivity by our customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are:\n\u2022\nproduct features, functionality, and ease of use;\n\u2022\nprice;\n\u2022\nbrand quality perception;\n\u2022\ncustomer service; and\n\u2022\ntimeliness, predictability, and reliability of delivery.\nIncreased competitive pressure and declining barriers to market entry could result in a loss of sales or market share or force us to lower prices. Failure to enhance our brand would impair our ability to increase or maintain our customer base, and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future.\nThe growth of our business consistent with our long-term model depends upon the successful execution of our mobile strategy and continued evolution towards collaborative automation in the markets we serve.\nOur strategy is focused upon the market opportunity presented by the continuing evolution towards collaborative automation and our expectation of increased use of mobile automation technology in the markets we serve. This new and rapidly changing environment poses significant risks, including, among other things, unforeseen changes in market demand impacting customer adoption levels, difficulties in developing and delivering products addressing customer requirements, and having sufficient available capital which may affect our ability to grow our business to the degree and on the timeline consistent with our expectations. From time to time, other strategic alternatives are presented to us causing us to evaluate our business opportunities. Future developments in the market and any future alternatives presented, may impact our execution of our product development and commercialization strategy.\nThe growth of our business depends upon the successful development and commercial acceptance of our new products.\nOur failure to develop, manufacture, and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset a decline in revenue from existing products or to successfully manage product and related inventory transitions could harm our business. We depend upon a variety of factors to ensure that our new and enhanced products are successfully commercialized, including timely and efficient completion of design and development, implementation of manufacturing processes, and effective sales, marketing, and customer service. Because of the complexity of our products, significant delays may occur in introducing new products, or between a product\u2019s initial introduction and volume production.\nThe development and commercialization of new products involve many difficulties, including:\n\u2022\nidentifying new product opportunities;\n\u2022\nretaining and hiring appropriate research and development personnel;\n\u2022\ndetermining the product\u2019s technical specifications;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully completing the development process;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully marketing the new product and achieving customer acceptance;\n\u2022\nmanaging inventory levels; and\n\u2022\nadditional customer service and warranty costs associated with supporting new product introductions or affecting subsequent field upgrades.\nWe must expend significant financial and management resources to develop new products. We cannot assure that we will receive meaningful revenue from these investments. If we are unable to continue to successfully develop new products in response to customer requirements or technological changes, or our new products are not commercially successful, our business may be harmed.\nOur acquisitions of MobileRobots and InMoTx expanded our business with new technologies and solutions for additional markets commencing in fiscal 2011. We had little or no experience in the mobile and certain packaging markets prior to these acquisitions and were unable to accurately forecast the future commercial acceptance of these product lines. This led to restructurings changing focus on our efforts on our core competencies and sources of revenue generation, with selective investment of resources in new businesses which take longer to build revenue, and we focused on our core and mobile businesses, altering our sales model for our packaging business to a channel focus. This focus and selective investment may negatively impact the growth of our new businesses and revenue potentially earned from related new products.\nWe generally have no long-term customer contracts and our backlog cannot be relied upon as a future indicator of sales.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers, and existing contracts and purchase commitments may be canceled under certain circumstances. As a result, we are exposed to competitive price pressures on every order, and our agreements with customers do not provide assurance of future sales. Our customers are not required to make minimum purchases and may cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty. Our backlog should not be relied on as a measure of anticipated demand or future revenue, because the orders constituting our backlog may be subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellation without significant penalty to the customer. Any reductions, cancellations or deferrals in customer orders would negatively impact our business.\nWe market and sell our products primarily through an indirect channel comprised of third-party resellers not under our control.\nWe believe that our ability to sell products to systems integrators and OEMs will continue to be important to our success. However, our relationships with these partners are generally not exclusive, and we cannot control the timing or amount of their procurement or marketing of our products. Some systems integrators and OEMs who sell our products also sell products of our competitors. If they choose to promote competing products or simply fail to market our products successfully, our revenue could decrease.\nAs we enter new geographic and applications markets, we must locate and establish relationships with systems integrators and OEMs to assist us in building sales in those markets. Because of product integration expenses and the large amount of training required, significant time and resources may be required to establish a profitable relationship with a systems integrator or OEM. We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining an effective relationship with new systems integrators or OEMs, which would adversely affect our business.\nAny future acquisitions may disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nWe have acquired technologies and companies in the past and may acquire other businesses and technologies to further our strategic objectives. These new businesses may require investment to introduce new products to customers without any guarantee of revenues sufficient to fund these investments and to make these businesses successful.\nAcquisitions present risks, including:\n\u2022\nsignificant expenditures of cash and dilutive stock issuances;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating product offerings, operations, or workforce;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing and maintaining effective uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel or customers from either our current business or the acquired company\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing supplier relationships;\n\u2022\ndisruptions of our on-going businesses and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in realizing our financial and strategic objectives for the acquired business;\n\u2022\nnegative impact on results of operations due to goodwill impairment write-offs, amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill, or assumption of anticipated liabilities;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new markets, geographic areas, and distribution channels in which we have limited or no previous experience; and\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the acquired company\u2019s product.\nThe risks above could significantly harm our business. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or adequately address these risks could materially harm our financial results.\nOur products could have unknown defects which may give rise to claims against us, increase our expenses, or harm our reputation.\nOur products and enhancements are complex and, despite testing, may contain defects, errors or performance problems. Any defects or errors could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, harmed customer relationships, and loss of market share. Newly released products, which have not seen as much use and testing in the marketplace as older products, are more susceptible to undetected defects. As we aim to generate increasing revenues from sales of recently released products, the negative impact on our business resulting from defects in such products could be significant.\nThe existence of any defects, errors, or failures in our products could also lead to product liability claims against us, our channel partners, or our customers. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the coverage limits of these policies may not adequately cover future claims. Any claim could result in significant legal defense costs, divert resources, harm our reputation, and damage our business.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology may impair our competitive advantage.\nOur success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology and trade secrets. We primarily rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection, licenses, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights, but have not always sought patent, registration, or similar protection on our technology where it may have been available. The steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property or to provide us with any commercial advantage. The process of obtaining patent protection can be time consuming and costly, and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to uncertainty and litigation risks.\nWe may face costly intellectual property infringement claims.\nAllegations of intellectual property infringement by our products may arise and could include claims against us, our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers. Because there are numerous patents in the automation industry, it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes intellectual property rights. As a result, we may be forced to respond to intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights. Regardless of merit, these claims could consume management time, result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays. In settling these claims, we may be required to cease selling products or services, pay damages, redesign the challenged technology, or enter into unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements. Any of these could seriously harm our business.\nInformation security breaches or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to run our business, including for management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of products, reporting results of operations, collection and storage of personal data of our customers, employees and other stakeholders, and various other processes and transactions. Certain of these systems are managed by third-party service providers. Although we take measures to protect our information assets, our security measures may not detect or prevent every attempted breach. Although we have not experienced any material cybersecurity breach, we may be subject to information security breaches caused by, among other things, illegal hacking, computer viruses, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. A breach could result in an interruption in our operations, unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, violation of privacy or other laws, and exposure to litigation, regulatory actions or statutory penalites. Any such breach could materially harm our business and operating results.\nOur investments in certain new markets subject us to increased regulation and potential product liability, and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in these markets or that risks related to these industries will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur systems and controls are sold in a variety of industries, including semiconductor, food, packaging and medical, among others. We have increased our strategic focus on sales for certain applications that are more highly regulated, including the automation of repetitive operations in diagnostic and pharmaceutical labs. As we seek sales in the medical and food packaging industries, we must ensure that our products and systems comply with applicable regulatory requirements. This will increase our costs and our failure to comply with these requirements could damage our ability to sell our products or subject us to regulatory actions or fines.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous substances used in the manufacturing and assembly of our products. We believe that we are in compliance with material environmental regulations and have all necessary environmental permits. However, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in penalties or liabilities, and could curtail our operations.\nOur success depends on our continuing ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly-qualified personnel.\nOur inability to attract, train, motivate, and retain qualified management, sales, and technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to design, manufacture, market and sell our products, and to meet our requirements as a public company. Many companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we do. In addition, in making employment decisions in the technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the equity they receive in connection with their employment. Therefore, volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain technical personnel, which could harm our business.\nCompliance with recently passed health care legislation and potential increases in the cost of providing health care plans to our employees may adversely affect our business.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act became law in March 2010. These healthcare acts contain provisions that will affect employer-sponsored health care plans, but it remains uncertain whether and by how much these acts and related regulation will increase health care costs of employers. Significant annual increases in the cost of providing employee health coverage may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management must establish, maintain and make certain assessments and certifications regarding our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting. We have dedicated significant resources to comply with these requirements, including significant actions to develop, evaluate, and test our internal controls, but cannot provide absolute assurances. A failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in inaccurate or late reporting of our financial results, an investigation by regulatory authorities, a loss of investor confidence, a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and exposure to costly litigation or regulatory proceedings.\nOur concentration of our equity ownership among few stockholders could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our securities, and may permit a few stockholders to influence the results of stockholder decisions.\nA small number of holders own the substantial majority of our outstanding equity. These securities are generally freely tradable or subject to registration statements, permitting their sale with little or no restriction. The potential sale of these securities creates meaningful overhang on the market for our securities and sales by any of these large holders would increase the current volatility of our common stock, the market price of which is affected by our low trading volume. This may affect the trading market for our stock, and could control the results of matters requiring stockholder approval, which may delay or prevent a change of control or negatively affect our stock price.\nStockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock may be depressed by future issuances of additional shares of our equity securities.\nIn June 2015, we issued 1,391,304 shares of common stock in a registered offering. We have also previously issued shares of convertible preferred stock, all of which was converted into common stock in 2014. We may issue additional common or preferred stock or other equity securities for various reasons, including financing our operations, fund acquisitions or hire or retain employees. Issuances of our equity securities, or the perception that such issuances may occur, could dilute the interests of our stockholders and have a material negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. The rights and preferences of any preferred stock we issue may decrease the perceived value, and thus the trading price, of our common stock. The preferred stock may be convertible at the holder\u2019s option and the issuance of common stock upon such conversion could require us to issue a significant number of shares of our common stock and dilute existing shareholders.\nAt June 30, 2015, options to purchase or restricted stock units for approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock were outstanding under our equity compensation plans, and approximately an additional 0.3 million shares of common stock were reserved for future grant and issuance under such plans. We can also issue shares under our employee stock purchase plan, which had approximately 0.2 million shares available for issuance at June 30, 2015. Shares of common stock issued under these plans are generally freely tradable in the public market, subject to certain limitations applicable to our affiliates. Option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases could increase the number of common shares outstanding and could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock, due to our low trading volume. Our use of equity to raise additional financing or as consideration in connection with a future acquisition or other transaction could also result in the dilution of our stockholders\u2019 equity interest.\nOur stock price may fluctuate widely, making resale of our common stock difficult.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially. Our stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors including:\n\u2022\nfluctuating operating results;\n\u2022\nour liquidity needs and constraints;\n\u2022\nour restructuring activities and changes in management and other personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our business focus and operational organization;\n\u2022\nour limited public float and the limited trading volume of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market;\n\u2022\nthe business environment, including the operating results and stock prices of companies in the industries we serve;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the intelligent automation and packaging industries;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or changes in product pricing by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nlitigation or claims relating to the volatility of our common stock, internal controls, proprietary rights or other matters;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the financial markets; and\n\u2022\nperceived dilution from stock issuances in financing or acquisition transactions.\nThe effects of new regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to SEC requirements applicable to companies manufacturing or contracting for the manufacture of products which require specific minerals, known as conflict minerals. Such companies must disclose annually whether they used any conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. If a company uses conflict minerals from those countries or attests that no such conflict minerals are used, additional requirements are triggered. We may face increased costs of regulatory compliance, potential risks to our reputation, or difficulty satisfying any customers that insist on conflict-free products, which may harm our business.\nDeploying a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are in the process of deploying a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. This project requires significant investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of many processes of our business and the attention of many employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our corporate initiatives. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and integration of the new ERP system could result in potentially much higher costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products, provide services, manage our supply chain and fulfill contractual obligations, file reports with the SEC in a timely manner and/or otherwise operate our business, or otherwise impact our controls environment. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 82664, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "ADEP"}
