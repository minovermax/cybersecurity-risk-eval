Risk Factors\nPlease note that any risk, uncertainty or other factor that has a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of our IPH segment may not result in a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of Dynegy on a consolidated basis due to the relative size of the IPH segment as well as the ring-fenced structuring of IPH and its subsidiaries. However, you should review the risk factor regarding the IPH ring-fenced structure and the risk that a creditor of IPH, or a bankruptcy trustee if any entity of the IPH segment were to become a debtor in bankruptcy, may nevertheless be successful in subjecting Dynegy to the claims of IPH and its subsidiaries.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d All statements included or incorporated by reference in this annual report, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements represent our reasonable judgment of the future based on various factors and using numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements.

They use words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpect\u201d and other words of similar meaning. In particular, these include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following:\n\u2022\nbeliefs and assumptions about weather and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nbeliefs, assumptions and projections regarding the demand for power, generation volumes and commodity pricing, including natural gas prices and the timing of a recovery in natural gas prices, if any;\n\u2022\nbeliefs and assumptions about market competition, generation capacity and regional supply and demand characteristics of the wholesale and retail power markets, including the anticipation of plant retirements and higher market pricing over the longer term;\n\u2022\nsufficiency of, access to and costs associated with coal, fuel oil and natural gas inventories and transportation thereof;\n\u2022\nthe effects of, or changes to, MISO, PJM, CAISO, NYISO or ISO-NE power and capacity procurement processes;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding, or impacts of, environmental matters, including costs of compliance, availability and adequacy of emission credits and the impact of ongoing proceedings and potential regulations or changes to current regulations, including those relating to climate change, air emissions, cooling water intake structures, coal combustion byproducts and other laws and regulations that we are, or could become, subject to, which could increase our costs, result in an impairment of our assets, cause us to limit or terminate the operation of certain of our facilities, or otherwise have a negative financial effect;\n\u2022\nbeliefs about the outcome of legal, administrative, legislative and regulatory matters;\n\u2022\nprojected operating or financial results, including anticipated cash flows from operations, revenues and profitability;\n\u2022\nour focus on safety and our ability to efficiently operate our assets so as to capture revenue generating opportunities and operating margins;\n\u2022\nour ability to mitigate forced outage risk, including managing risk associated with CP in PJM and new performance incentives in ISO-NE;\n\u2022\nour ability to optimize our assets through targeted investment in cost effective technology enhancements;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our strategies to capture opportunities presented by changes in commodity prices and to manage our exposure to energy price volatility;\n\u2022\nefforts to secure retail sales and the ability to grow the retail business;\n\u2022\nefforts to identify opportunities to reduce congestion and improve busbar power prices;\n\u2022\nability to mitigate impacts associated with expiring RMR and/or capacity contracts;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding our compliance with the Credit Agreement, including collateral demands, interest expense, any applicable financial ratios and other payments;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding performance standards and capital and maintenance expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe timing and anticipated benefits to be achieved through our company-wide improvement programs, including our PRIDE initiative;\n\u2022\nanticipated timing, outcomes and impacts of the expected retirements of Brayton Point and Wood River;\n\u2022\nbeliefs about the costs and scope of the ongoing demolition and site remediation efforts at the Vermilion facility and any potential future remediation obligations at the South Bay facility; and\n\u2022\nbeliefs regarding redevelopment efforts for the Morro Bay facility.\nAny or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below.\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nBecause wholesale and retail power prices are subject to significant volatility and because many of our power generation facilities operate without long-term power sales agreements, our revenues and profitability are subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe majority of our facilities operate as \u201cmerchant\u201d facilities without long-term power sales agreements. As a result, we largely sell electric energy, capacity and ancillary services into the wholesale energy spot market or into other wholesale and retail power markets on a short-term basis and are not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any or all of the electric energy, capacity or ancillary services from those facilities at commercially attractive rates or that our facilities will be able to operate profitably. We depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power, capacity and fuel. Given the volatility of commodity power prices, to the extent we do not secure long-term power sales agreements for the output of our power generation facilities, our revenues and profitability will be subject to volatility, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Factors that may materially impact the power markets and our financial results include:\n\u2022\naddition of new supplies of power from existing competitors or new market entrants as a result of the development of new generation plants, expansion of existing plants or additional transmission capacity;\n\u2022\nuneconomic generation kept on line by utilities, aided by state-based subsidies;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulations and legislation;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022\nelectric supply disruptions including plant outages;\n\u2022\nbasis risk from transmission losses and congestion and changes in power transmission infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of new technologies for the production of natural gas;\n\u2022\nfuel price volatility;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\ncapacity performance requirements and penalties;\n\u2022\nincreased competition or price pressure driven by generation from renewable sources and other subsidized generation;\n\u2022\nregulatory constraints on pricing (current or future), including RTO and ISO rules, policies and actions, or the functioning of the energy trading markets and energy trading generally;\n\u2022\nthe existence and effectiveness of demand-side management; and\n\u2022\nconservation efforts and energy efficiency rules and the extent to which they impact electricity demand.\nOur commercial strategies for our wholesale and retail businesses may not be executed as planned, may result in lost opportunities or adversely affect financial performance.\nWe seek to commercialize our assets through sales arrangements of various types. In doing so, we attempt to balance a desire for greater predictability of earnings and cash flows in the short- and medium-terms with our expectation that commodity prices will rise over the longer term, creating upside opportunities for those with unhedged generation volumes. Our ability to successfully execute this strategy is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, including market liquidity and design, correlation risk, commodity price cycles, the availability of counterparties willing to transact with us or to transact with us at prices we think are commercially acceptable, the availability of liquidity to post collateral in support of our derivative instruments and the reliability of the systems and models comprising our commercial operations function. The availability of market liquidity and willing counterparties could be negatively impacted by poor economic and financial market conditions, including impacts on financial institutions and other current and potential counterparties as well as counterparties\u2019 views of our creditworthiness. If we are unable to transact in the short- and medium-terms, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be subject to significant uncertainty and volatility. Alternatively, significant power sales for any such period may precede a run-up in commodity prices, resulting in lost up-side opportunities.\nFurther, financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage our power portfolio. A portion of the generation power portfolio is used to provide power to wholesale and retail customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, generation output is sold in the wholesale market. To the extent our power\nportfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of our customers, we must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Our financial results may be negatively affected if we are unable to manage the power portfolio and cost-effectively meet the requirements of our customers.\nA decline in market liquidity and our ability to manage our counterparty credit risk could adversely affect us.\nOur supplier counterparties may experience deteriorating credit. These conditions could cause counterparties in the natural gas, coal and power markets, particularly in the energy commodity derivative markets that we rely on for our hedging activities, to withdraw from participation in those markets. If multiple parties withdraw from those markets, market liquidity may be threatened, which in turn could adversely impact our business. Additionally, these conditions may cause our counterparties to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Our credit risk may be exacerbated to the extent collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, retail sales subject us to credit risk through competitive electricity supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies and governmental entities. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer\u2019s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve that customer, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fuel and fuel transportation cost increases and interruptions in fuel supplies.\nWe purchase the fuel requirements for many of our power generation facilities, primarily those that are natural gas-fired, under short-term contracts or on the spot market. As a result, we face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility, as fuel deliveries may not exactly match those required for energy sales.\nMoreover, profitable operation of many of our coal-fired generation facilities is highly dependent on coal prices and coal transportation rates. We mitigate our price exposure to coal and related transportation by entering into long-term contracts. Transportation of coal can also be affected by rail equipment availability, extreme weather or natural disasters, each of which may slow or stop the delivery from the mine to the facility. In addition, certain of our coal suppliers have filed for bankruptcy protection, which could negatively impact our coal supply.\nFurther, any changes in the costs of coal, fuel oil, natural gas or transportation rates and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results. If we are unable to procure fuel for physical delivery at prices we consider favorable, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOperation of power generation facilities involves significant risks customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves risks customary to the power industry that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, operational and safety performance below expected levels and the inability to transport our product to customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability, or with respect to capacity performance, significant penalties. Unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of selling fewer MW or require us to incur significant costs as a result of running one of our higher cost units or obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our forward power sales obligations. If we are unsuccessful in operating our facilities efficiently, such inefficiency could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur costs of compliance with existing environmental requirements are significant, and costs of compliance with new environmental requirements or factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities. Such environmental regulation imposes, among other things, capital and operating expenditures, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of certain substances and wastes, including CCR, and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances (including carbon emissions) into the environment, as well as environmental impacts associated with cooling water intake structures. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations may be adopted or may become applicable to us or our facilities, and litigation or enforcement proceedings could be commenced against us. Proposals being considered by federal and state authorities (including proposals regarding cooling water intake structures and carbon) could, if and when adopted or\nenacted, require us to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, impair assets, or limit or terminate operation of certain of our facilities. If any of these events occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nMany environmental laws require approvals or permits from governmental authorities before construction, modification or operation of a power generation facility may commence. Certain environmental permits must be renewed periodically in order for us to continue operating our facilities. The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. Even where permits are not required, compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant capital and operating expenditures. We are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations, and to obtain numerous governmental permits when we modify and operate our facilities. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or permits, if we fail to obtain any required approval or permit, or if we are unable to comply with the terms of such approvals or permits, the operation of our facilities may be interrupted or become subject to additional costs and/or legal challenges. Further, changed interpretations of existing regulations may subject historical maintenance, repair and replacement activities at our facilities to claims of noncompliance. With the continuing trend toward stricter environmental standards and more extensive regulatory and permitting requirements, our capital and operating environmental expenditures are likely to be substantial and may significantly increase in the future. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex government regulation. Changes in these regulations or in their implementation may affect costs of operating our facilities or our ability to operate our facilities, or increase competition, any of which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the generation and sale of energy commodities in each of the jurisdictions in which we have operations. Compliance with these ever-changing laws and regulations requires expenses (including legal representation) and monitoring, capital and operating expenditures. Potential changes in laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our business include: the introduction, or reintroduction, of rate caps or pricing constraints; inability to pass on costs to customers; state regulatory initiatives, including subsidized generation; increased credit standards, collateral costs or margin requirements, as well as reduced market liquidity, as a result of potential OTC market regulation; or a variation of these. Furthermore, these and other market-based rules and regulations are subject to change at any time, and we cannot predict what changes may occur in the future or how such changes might affect any facet of our business.\nThe costs and burdens associated with complying with the increased number of regulations may have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations governing our business or if we fail to maintain or obtain advantageous regulatory authorizations and exemptions. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of any noncompliant facility, the imposition of liens or fines, or civil or criminal liability. Moreover, increased competition within the sector resulting from potential legislative changes, regulatory changes or other factors may create greater risks to the stability of our power generation earnings and cash flows generally.\nRegulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor the last several years, there has been a robust public debate about climate change and the potential for regulations requiring lower emissions of GHG, primarily CO2 and methane. As discussed in Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters, at the federal and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. Power generating facilities are a major source of GHG emissions. We cannot confidently predict the final outcome of the current debate on climate change nor can we predict with confidence the ultimate requirements of proposed or anticipated federal and state legislation and regulations intended to address climate change. These activities, and the highly politicized nature of climate change, suggest a trend toward increased regulation of GHG that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Existing and anticipated federal and state regulations intended to address climate change may significantly increase the cost of providing electric power, resulting in far-reaching and significant impacts on us and others in the power generation industry over time. It is possible that federal and state actions intended to address climate change could result in costs assigned to GHG emissions that we would not be able to fully recover through market pricing or otherwise. If capital and/or operating costs related to compliance with regulations intended to address climate change become great enough to render the operations of certain plants uneconomical, we could, at our option and subject to any applicable financing agreements or other obligations, reduce operations or cease to operate such plants and forego such capital and/or operating costs. Though we consider our largest risk related to climate change to be legislative and regulatory changes, we are subject to physical risks inherent in industrial operations including severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes. To the extent that changes in climate effect changes in weather patterns (such as more severe weather events) or changes in sea level where we have generating facilities, we could be adversely affected.\nAvailability and cost of emission allowances could materially impact our costs of operations.\nWe are required to maintain, either through allocation or purchase, sufficient emission allowances to support our operations in the ordinary course of operating our power generation facilities. These allowances are used to meet our obligations imposed by various applicable environmental laws, and the trend toward more stringent regulations (including regulations regarding GHG emissions) will likely require us to obtain new or additional emission allowances. If our operational needs require more than our allocated quantity of emission allowances, we may be forced to purchase such allowances on the open market, which could be costly. If we are unable to maintain sufficient emission allowances to match our operational needs, we may have to curtail our operations so as not to exceed our available emission allowances, or install costly new emissions controls. As we use the emissions allowances that we have purchased on the open market, costs associated with such purchases will be recognized as an operating expense. If such allowances are available for purchase, but only at significantly higher prices, their purchase could materially increase our costs of operations in the affected markets and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in wholesale and retail power markets, together with the age of certain of our generation facilities, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur power generation business competes with other non-utility generators, regulated utilities, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, other energy service companies and financial institutions in the sale of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services, as well as in the procurement of fuel, transmission and transportation services. Moreover, aggregate demand for power may be met by generation capacity based on several competing technologies, as well as power generating facilities fueled by alternative or renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric power, synthetic fuels, solar, wind, wood, geothermal, waste heat and solid waste sources. Regulatory initiatives designed to enhance and/or subsidize renewable generation increases competition from these types of facilities.\nWe also compete against other energy merchants on the basis of our relative operating skills, financial position and access to credit sources. Electric energy customers, wholesale energy suppliers and transporters often seek financial guarantees, credit support such as letters of credit, and other assurances that their energy contracts will be satisfied. Companies with which we compete may have greater resources in these areas. In addition, certain of our current facilities are relatively old. Newer plants owned by competitors may be more efficient than some of our plants, which may put these plants at a competitive disadvantage. Over time, some of our plants may become unable to compete because of subsidized generation, including public utility commission supported PPAs, and the construction of new plants. Such new plants could have a number of advantages including: more efficient equipment, newer technology that could result in fewer emissions or more advantageous locations on the electric transmission system. Additionally, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws and regulations because of the newer technology utilized in their facilities or the additional resources derived from owning more efficient facilities. Taken as a whole, the potential disadvantages of our aging fleet could result in lower run-times or even early asset retirement.\nOther factors may contribute to increased competition in wholesale power markets. New forms of capital and competitors have entered the industry, including financial investors who perceive that asset values are at levels below their true replacement value. As a result, a number of generation facilities in the U.S. are now owned by lenders and investment companies. Furthermore, mergers and asset reallocations in the industry could create powerful new competitors. Under any scenario, we anticipate that we will face competition from numerous companies in the industry.\nIn addition, our retail marketing efforts compete for customers in a competitive environment, which impacts the margins that we can earn on the volumes we are able to serve. Further, with retail competition, residential customers where we serve load can switch to and from competitive electric generation suppliers for their energy needs. If fewer customers switch to another supplier than anticipated, the load we must serve will be greater and, if market prices have increased, our costs will increase due to the need to go to the market to cover the incremental supply obligation. If more customers switch to another supplier than anticipated, the load we must serve will be lower and, if market prices have decreased, we could lose opportunities in the market. To the extent that competition increases, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nGenerally, we do not own or control transmission facilities required to sell wholesale power from our generation facilities. If transmission services are inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, RTOs and ISOs administer the transmission infrastructure and market, which are subject to changes in structure and operation and impose various pricing limitations. These changes and pricing limitations may affect our ability to deliver power to the market that would, in turn, adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities.\nWith the exception of EEI, which owns and controls transmission lines interconnecting the Joppa facility in EEI\u2019s control area to MISO, Tennessee Valley Authority (\u201cTVA\u201d) and Louisville Gas and Electric Company (\u201cLGE\u201d), we do not own or control the transmission facilities required to deliver the power from our generation facilities to the market. If transmission services from\nthese facilities are unavailable or disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected, which could result in reduced profitability, or with respect to capacity performance in PJM and performance incentives in ISO-NE, significant penalties. RTOs and ISOs provide transmission services, administer transparent and competitive power markets and maintain system reliability. Many of these RTOs and ISOs operate in the real-time and day-ahead markets in which we sell energy. The RTOs and ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose price limitations, offer caps, capacity performance requirements, penalties, and other mechanisms to guard against the potential exercise of market power in these markets. Price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. Problems or delays that may arise in the formation and operation of maturing RTOs and similar market structures, or changes in geographic scope, rules or market operations of existing RTOs, may also affect our ability to sell, the prices we receive or the cost to transmit power produced by our generating facilities. Market design as well as rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Retail business is subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to our reputation and/or the results of operations of the Retail business.\nThe Retail business requires access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. Examples of sensitive customer data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data and bank account information. The Retail business may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to the Retail business. If a significant breach occurred, our reputation may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished or we may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on our business and/or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnauthorized hedging and related activities by our employees could result in significant losses.\nWe intend to continue our commercial strategy, which emphasizes forward power sales opportunities intended to reduce the market price exposure of the Company to power price declines. We have various internal policies and procedures designed to monitor hedging activities and positions. These policies and procedures are designed, in part, to prevent unauthorized purchases or sales of products by our employees. We cannot assure, however, that these steps will detect and prevent inaccurate reporting and all other violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. A significant policy violation that is not detected could result in a substantial financial loss for us.\nOur risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with our commodity hedging activities.\nOur asset-based power position as well as our power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity hedging activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements. We attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when our policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, we cannot fully predict the impact that our commodity hedging activities and risk management decisions may have on our business and/or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nStrikes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA majority of the employees at our facilities are subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Additionally, unionization activities, including votes for union certification, could occur at the non-union generating facilities in our fleet. If union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strike or disruption, we could experience reduced power generation or outages if replacement labor is not procured. The ability to procure such replacement labor is uncertain. Strikes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe IPH segment\u2019s ring-fencing structure may not work as planned and Dynegy may be subject to the claims of the creditors of IPH and its subsidiaries.\nIn connection with the 2013 acquisition of New Ameren Energy Resources, LLC (\u201cAER\u201d) and its subsidiaries (the \u201cAER Acquisition\u201d), IPH and its direct and indirect subsidiaries were organized into ring-fenced groups. The entities within the IPH\nring-fenced structure maintain corporate separateness from our other current legal entities. This structure was implemented, in part, to minimize the risk that creditors of IPH, or a bankruptcy trustee if any entity of the IPH segment were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case, would attempt to assert claims against Dynegy for payment of IPH\u2019s obligations. The ring-fenced structure should preclude any corporate veil-piercing or other similar claims of IPH\u2019s creditors but, if any such claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The ring-fenced structure should also preclude any bankruptcy court from ordering the substantive consolidation of Dynegy\u2019s assets and liabilities with the assets and liabilities of any IPH debtor in bankruptcy. However, bankruptcy courts have broad equitable powers and, as a result, outcomes in bankruptcy proceedings are inherently difficult to predict. To the extent a bankruptcy court were to determine that substantive consolidation was appropriate under the facts and circumstances, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks and/or cyber-attacks may result in our inability to operate and fulfill our obligations, and could result in material repair costs.\nAs a power generator, we face heightened risk of terrorism, including cyber terrorism, either by a direct act against one or more of our generating facilities or an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is used to transport our power. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including third party cloud systems, to operate our generating facilities, engage in asset management activities, and process, transmit and store electronic information. Security breaches of this information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber terrorism, could lead to system disruptions, generating facility shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information related to our employees, vendors and counterparties, including retail counterparties.\nSystemic damage to one or more of our generating facilities and/or to the transmission and distribution infrastructure could result in our inability to operate in one or all of the markets we serve for an extended period of time. If our generating facilities are shut down, we would be unable to respond to the ISOs and RTOs or fulfill our obligations under various energy and/or capacity arrangements, resulting in lost revenues and potential fines, penalties and other liabilities. Pervasive cyber-attacks across our industry could affect the ability of ISOs and RTOs to function in some regions. The cost to restore our generating facilities after such an occurrence could be material.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or combinations that could be unsuccessful or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future, which would adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions.\nWe may enter into transactions that include acquiring or combining with other businesses. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or financing to complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate acquired or combined operations with our operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in evaluating the assets, operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\npotential lack of operating experience in new geographic/power markets or with different fuel sources;\n\u2022\nan increase in our expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s attention may be temporarily diverted; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity and/or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find transactions that fit our strategic objectives or increase the price we would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder our desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Consistent with industry practice, we routinely engage in discussions with industry participants regarding potential transactions, large and small. We intend to continue to engage in strategic discussions and will need to respond to potential opportunities quickly and decisively. As a result, strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our assets and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Structure\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability in the future to raise additional capital to fund our operations. It could also expose us to the risk of increased interest rates and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry as well as impact our cash available for distribution.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $7.4 billion of total indebtedness and approximately $6.9 billion of indebtedness net of cash. Our debt could have negative consequences for our financial condition including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock and the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to us, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in our credit facilities and other financing agreements;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. Furthermore, we may be unable to refinance or replace our existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. Our failure to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur existing credit facilities contain, and agreements we enter into in the future may contain, covenants that could restrict our financial flexibility.\nOur existing credit facilities contain covenants imposing certain requirements on our business. These requirements may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and may adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities. These covenants could place restrictions on our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends, repurchase or redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue some types of preferred shares;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into any agreements which limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to make dividends or otherwise transfer cash or assets to us or certain other subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge.\nAgreements we enter into in the future may also have similar or more restrictive covenants. A breach of any covenant in the existing credit facilities or the agreements governing our other indebtedness would result in a default. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under any such agreement and in a default with respect to, and acceleration of, the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated debt would become due and payable immediately. If that should occur, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt obligations. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nOur sub-investment grade status may adversely impact our commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.\nOur corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and we cannot assure you that our credit ratings will improve, or that they will not decline, in the future. Our credit ratings may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. We use a portion of our capital resources, in the form of cash, short-term investments, lien capacity and letters of credit, to satisfy these counterparty collateral demands. Our commodity agreements are tied to market pricing and may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. If we are unable to reliably forecast or anticipate collateral calls or if market conditions change such that counterparties are entitled to additional collateral, our liquidity could be strained and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Factors that could trigger increased demands for collateral include changes in our credit rating or liquidity and changes in commodity prices for power and fuel, among others. Should our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.\nIf our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have significant goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and long-lived assets recorded on our balance sheet. In accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Additionally, we review goodwill, our amortizable intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered include a decline in future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the energy industry, as well as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock.\nWe have performed the test for goodwill impairment and concluded that a goodwill impairment loss has not occurred at this time. Please read Critical Accounting Policies-Goodwill Impairment for further discussion. However, further goodwill impairment testing will be performed in future periods and may result in an impairment loss, which could be material. We performed asset impairment analyses of all facilities in 2015 and determined that no impairment charges were required, other than for our Wood River and Brayton Point facilities. Please read Note 9-Property, Plant and Equipment for further discussion.\nIssuances or acquisitions of our common stock, or sales or dispositions of our common stock by stockholders, that result in an ownership change as defined in Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) \u00a7382 could further limit our ability to use our federal net operating losses or alternative minimum tax credits to offset our future taxable income.\nIf an \"ownership change,\" as defined in Section 382 of the IRC (\u201cIRC \u00a7382\u201d) occurs, the amount of net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) credits that could be used in any one year following such ownership change could be substantially limited. In general, an \"ownership change\" would occur when there is a greater than 50 percentage point increase in ownership of a company's stock by stockholders, each of which owns (or is deemed to own under IRC \u00a7382) 5 percent or more of such company's stock. Given IRC \u00a7382's broad definition, an ownership change could be the unintended consequence of otherwise normal market trading in our stock that is outside our control. Dynegy has already experienced two \u201cownership changes\u201d under IRC \u00a7382 that limit the use of our NOLs and AMT credits that existed at the time and prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. NOLs that have been generated subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy are not currently subject to the limitations imposed by IRC \u00a7382. If, however, there is another \u201cownership change,\u201d the utilization of all NOLs and AMT credits existing at that time would be subject to additional annual limitations based upon a formula provided under IRC \u00a7382 that is based on the fair market value of the Company and prevailing interest rates at the time of the ownership change.", "PERMNO": 90352, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DYN.2"}
