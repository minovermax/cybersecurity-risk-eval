You should not invest in our common stock unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and other information in this annual report before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you could lose your entire investment in our Company.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBTS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.\nWe have incurred substantial operating and net losses, as well as negative operating cash flows, since our inception through December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reported net losses of $1,230,094 and $1,441,217, respectively, and at December 31, 2017 we had a working capital deficit of $9,470,970. At December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $62.6 million. These recurring losses, working capital deficit and the reliance on cash inflows from related parties have led our independent registered public accounting firm to include a statement in its audit report relating to our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in future periods until we are successful in significantly increasing our revenues. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise our revenues to a level which supports profitable operations and provides sufficient funds to pay our obligations. If we are unable to meet those obligations, we could be forced to cease operations in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our Company.\nWE NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IF WE CANNOT RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AS NEEDED, OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS WILL BE IN JEOPARDY AND WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.\nAs described elsewhere herein, our net sales are not sufficient to pay our operating expenses. Our capital requirements depend on a number of factors, including our ability to internally grow our revenues, manage our business and control our expenses. Historically, our operations have been financed primarily through a credit line from our Chief Executive Officer, as well as short-term loans from other affiliates. At December 31, 2017, we owe him approximately $8 million which is due in December 2018. Earlier in 2017 he advised us that he does not expect to continue to provide working capital advances to the Company at historic levels, if at all. During 2017, he lent us a total of $875,000 as compared to $1,363,732 in 2016. From January 1, 2018 through April 9, 2018, he has lent us an additional $200,000. The reductions in the amount of advances to us from our Chief Executive Officer have adversely impacted our operations from time to time. While we do not have any external sources of liquidity at this time, the Company is in continuing discussion with third parties for potential investment. These historic discussions, however, have not resulted in identifying any potential capital raising transactions which were upon proposed terms which we believed were fair to our Company and our stockholders. Given our history of losses and debt levels, we expect to continue to face a number of challenges in our ability to raise capital. If we do not raise funds as needed, or if our Chief Executive Officer should continue to reduce amounts advanced to us or discontinue altogether his practice of advancing funds to us to pay our operating expenses, our ability to provide for current working capital needs, pay our obligations as they become due, grow our Company, and continue our existing business and operations is in jeopardy. In this event, we would no longer be able to continue as a going concern and you could lose all of your investment in our Company.\nOUR NET SALES INCREASED IN 2017 FROM 2016 BUT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES WE WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR SALES, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, TO A LEVEL WHICH WILL FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.\nAlthough our net sales for 2017 increased by 16% from 2016, our current operations remain insufficient to fund our operating expenses and pay our obligations as they become due. We used cash in operations of approximately $703,037 and $1,268,730 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our gross margins have also declined in 2017 from 2016 by approximately 3% as a result of certain fixed costs which are included in our cost of sales. As long as our cash flow from operations remains insufficient to fund our operations, we will continue depleting our cash and other financial resources, which are extremely limited. Our failure to achieve profitable operations in future periods will adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern. In this event, you could lose all of your investment in our Company.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT UPON SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND ONE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR REPRESENTING THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THIS DISTRIBUTOR WILL MEET THE TARGETED SALES GOALS.\nIn September 2017 we granted DNOW exclusive worldwide rights to sell our products in the oil and gas industry effective September 7, 2017. Under the terms of the agreement as amended in February 2018, sales to all customers in the oil and gas industry have been attributed to DNOW targeted sales goals. Targeted quarterly goals, if achieved, would represent an aggregate of approximately $4 million in sales revenue between August 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018. This revenue includes any and all purchases made directly or indirectly through Puradyn by any customer servicing the oil and gas industry. Sales under the agreement amounted to $558,141 for the period from August 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, representing approximately 25% of our total net sales for 2017. However, the sales to DNOW were approximately 31% below the targeted goals for that period and these sales are made at lower gross margins than sales to other customers. There are no binding obligations from DNOW to purchase a certain amount of product from us, nor to undertake any specific marketing or sales incentives related to our products. Historically, sales to the oil and gas industry have represented approximately 70% and 41%, respectively, of our net sales in 2017 and 2016. In 2017, DNOW represented 51% of our total sales into this industry. While we granted DNOW these exclusive rights because we believed its distribution network was broad enough that it could facilitate our growth in this industry, we are wholly dependent upon DNOW\u2019s sales efforts over which we have limited control. There are no assurances it will ever meet the non-binding targeted revenue goals and the exclusive nature of this agreement prevents us from engaging other distributors to facilitate sales of our products in the oil and gas industry. In that event, our revenues may be adversely impacted in future periods.\nWE OWE APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION WHICH IS DUE BY DECEMBER 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2017, we owe our Chief Executive Officer approximately $8 million, and he has advanced us an additional $200,000 through April 9, 2018. This loan, which is unsecured, is due on December 31, 2018 or (i) at such time as we have raised an additional $7 million over the $3.5 million raised in prior offerings, or (ii) at such time as we are operating within sufficient cash flow parameters to sustain operations, or (iii) until a disposition of our Company, such as an acquisition or merger, occurs. We do not have sufficient funds to pay this loan when it becomes due. Although he has continually extended the due date of this obligation since the credit line was first extended to us in 2002, most recently extending the maturity date from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, these extensions were generally provided on an annual basis so to an extended term which made the obligation a long-term debt. There are no assurances this stockholder will continue to provide extension to us prior to the due date. While we have engaged in informal discussions with him regarding a conversion of this amount into equity or outright forgiveness, no formal agreement has been reached and there are no assurances whatsoever that any accommodation on this obligation will be made to us.\nWE RELY ON SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM US.\nWe are dependent upon sales to a limited number of customers. During 2017, three customers individually accounted for approximately 36%, 16% and 12%, respectively (for a total of 64%) of our net sales. During 2016 three customers individually accounted for approximately 24%, 18% and 15%, respectively (for a total of 57%) of our net sales. We do not have contracts with our customers and the loss of sales from one or more of these customers could materially impact our results of operations in future periods.\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2017 OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES INCLUDE $1,626,003 OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION. WE DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS.\nSince 2005, Messrs. Sandler and Kroger, two of our executive officers, and one other employee, have deferred a portion of the cash compensation due them to assist us in managing our cash flow and working capital needs. As there is no written agreement with these employees which memorializes the terms of salary deferral, only an election to do so, it is possible that the employees could demand payment in full at any time, elect to no longer defer their salaries, or reduce the amount they currently defer. We do not have the funds to pay these amounts, and unless we are successful in raising additional capital we are unable to satisfy any demands by these officers and employees for full payment of these obligations of which there are no assurances, we would be unable to pay these amounts to our employees. In that event, it is likely we would lose their services in future periods.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AS IT IS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED IS IN JEOPARDY.\nOur success is heavily dependent on our proprietary technology and we rely on a combination of contractual rights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. There can be no assurances that the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the technology or independent development by others of products with features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our products. In addition, although we believe that any new technology currently in development or patent pending has been independently developed and does not infringe on the proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that we are correct or that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. If instituted, there can be no assurances we will have adequate resources to defend a patent infringement or other proprietary rights infringement action. If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights or if other products should be developed which are substantially similar to ours, our ability to continue our operations as they are presently conducted could be in jeopardy and we could be forced to cease operations. The Company believes it will have future benefits from current patent awards and applications to the extent it has working capital to pursue those patents, of which there is no assurance, and does not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents that may expire in the near-term.\nRisk Related to our Common Stock\nPROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS MAY DELAY OR PREVENT A TAKE-OVER WHICH MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our shareholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt. In addition, certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law also may be deemed to have certain anti-takeover effects. Further, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors in their sole discretion. Although, to date, we have never issued preferred stock, our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nTHE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS AND OPTIONS WILL BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had 69,016,468 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and the following securities, which are exercisable into shares of our common stock, were outstanding:\n\u00b7\n990,162 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants with exercise prices ranging from $0.05 to $0.35 per share; and\n\u00b7\n3,180,000 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options with exercise prices ranging from $0.026 per share to $0.35 per share.\nThe issuance of these shares will be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nBECAUSE OUR STOCK CURRENTLY TRADES BELOW $5.00 PER SHARE, AND IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQB\u00ae MARKETPLACE, OUR STOCK IS CONSIDERED A \"PENNY STOCK\" WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY.\nAs the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a \"penny stock,\" and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent prior to the transaction.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a \"penny stock,\" including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of our common stock in the secondary market because few brokers or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities. Purchasers of our common stock may find it difficult to resell the shares in the secondary market.\nTHERE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES IN ORDER FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE.\nWhile our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Tier of the OTC Markets, our common stock is thinly traded and should be considered an illiquid investment. The market price of our common stock will likely be highly volatile, as is the stock market in general, and the market for over the counter quoted stocks in particular. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control, such as conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFINRA SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDERS ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, which are discussed earlier in this section, the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must have reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market value for our shares.", "PERMNO": 89259, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "PFTI"}
