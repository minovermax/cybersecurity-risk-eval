{"cik": "839470", "company": "WESTWATER RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. Every investor or potential investor in our securities should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business,\nfinancial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming Westwater will continue as a going concern. This assumes continuing operations and the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business.\nWe have incurred significant losses since ceasing production of uranium in 2009 and expect to continue to incur losses as a result of costs and expenses related to maintaining our properties and general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2019, we had a net working capital deficit of approximately $1.3 million, cash of approximately $1.9 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $302 million. As a result of our evaluation of the Company\u2019s liquidity for the next twelve months, we have included a discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern in our consolidated financial statements, and our independent auditor\u2019s report for year ended December 31, 2019 includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d Our capital needs have, in recent years, been funded through sales of our debt and equity securities. In the event that we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, long-term prospects and ability to continue as a viable business.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital, our business may fail and holders of our securities may lose their entire investment.\nWe had approximately $1.9 million in cash at December 31, 2019 and have raised approximately $9.2 million through February 14, 2020 from sales under our Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and PA with Lincoln Park and receipt of the purchase price from URC pursuant to the asset purchase agreement. On average, WWR expended approximately $0.9 million of cash per month during 2019, which is expected to continue during 2020. However, the Company has taken measures to reduce general and administrative costs going forward and has reduced activity in Texas while preserving regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that WWR will be able to obtain additional capital after it exhausts its current cash. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would likely result in substantial dilution to existing holders of our securities. If we borrow money, we will have to pay interest and may also have to agree to restrictions that limit our operating flexibility.\nIf additional capital is not available in sufficient amounts or on a timely basis, WWR will experience liquidity problems, and WWR could face the need to significantly curtail current operations, change our planned business strategies and pursue other remedial measures. Any curtailment of business operations would have a material negative effect on operating results, the value of our outstanding stock is likely to fall, and our business may fail, causing holders of our securities to lose their entire investment.\nWWR is not producing any minerals at this time. As a result, we currently have no sources of operating cash. If we cannot monetize certain existing assets, partner with another company that has cash resources, find other means of generating revenue other than producing graphite, vanadium, lithium or uranium and/or access additional sources of private or public capital, we may not be able to remain in business.\nAs a result of low uranium prices, we ceased production of uranium in 2009. We are not planning to commence production at any of our South Texas properties until we are able to acquire additional reserves or mineralized material and uranium prices recover to levels that will ensure that production, once resumed, is sustainable in the 300,000 to 500,000\npound per year range. Our ability to begin plant construction and mine development in Texas, New Mexico or Alabama is subject to availability of financing and activation of our permits and licenses. All of our lithium activities in Nevada and Utah are highly prospective and may never generate revenue. We do not have a committed source of financing for the development of our graphite, vanadium, lithium or uranium projects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing for our projects. Our inability to develop our properties would have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nUntil we begin graphite, vanadium, lithium or uranium production, we have no way to generate cash inflows unless we monetize certain of our assets or through financing activities. Our future graphite production is dependent on completion of processing facilities and successful implementation of graphite purification technology. Our future lithium or uranium production, cash flow and income are dependent upon the results of exploration as well as our ability to bring on new, as yet unidentified wellfields and to acquire and develop additional reserves. Our future vanadium production is dependent upon the completion of an evaluation plan that will assess the amount, location and size of vanadium concentrations at our Coosa mine in Alabama. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully produce graphite, that our properties will be placed into production or that we will be able to continue to find, develop, acquire and finance additional reserves. If we cannot monetize certain existing assets, partner with another company that has cash resources, find other means of generating revenue other than producing graphite, vanadium, lithium or uranium and/or access additional sources of private or public capital, we may not be able to remain in business and holders of our securities may lose their entire investment.\nThe success of our mining operations is dependent on our ability to develop our properties and then mine them at a profit sufficient to finance further mining activities and for the acquisition and development of additional properties. The volatility of graphite, vanadium, lithium and uranium prices makes long-range planning uncertain and raising capital difficult.\nThe success of our mining operations is dependent on our ability to develop our properties and then operate them at a profit sufficient to finance further mining activities and for the acquisition and development of additional properties. The volatility of graphite, vanadium, lithium and uranium prices makes long-range planning uncertain and raising capital difficult.\nOur ability to obtain positive cash flow will be dependent on developing and then mining sufficient quantities of graphite, vanadium, lithium and uranium at a profit sufficient to finance our operations and for the acquisition and development of additional mining properties. Any profit will necessarily be dependent upon, and affected by, the long and short-term market prices of graphite, vanadium, lithium and uranium, which are subject to significant fluctuation. For example, uranium prices have been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, such as, the demand for nuclear power, political and economic conditions in uranium producing and consuming countries, uranium supply from secondary sources and uranium production levels and costs of production. A significant, sustained drop in graphite, vanadium, lithium and uranium prices would cause us to recognize impairment of the carrying value of our graphite, vanadium, uranium or other assets.\nThe timing and amount of compensation relating to the revocation of the mining and exploration licenses for our Temrezli and Sefaatli projects is yet to be determined.\nOn June 20, 2018, the General Directorate of Mining Affairs, a department of the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, notified the Company that the mining and exploration licenses for its Temrezli and Sefaatli projects located in Turkey had been revoked and potential compensation would be proffered. Westwater has reached out on numerous occasions to the Turkish government to resolve this dispute amicably, to reinstate the licenses and to remedy its unlawful actions, but to no avail. As a result, on December 13, 2018 Westwater filed a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Turkey before ICSID, pursuant to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Turkey concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments. On December 21, 2018, ICSID advised that it had formally \u201cregistered\u201d the Request for Arbitration.\nWhile the Company intends to seek full and fair compensation for the licenses through the Request for Arbitration filed with ICSID, the timing of such compensation is yet to be determined. In addition, the Company can provide no\nassurance about the amount of compensation, if any and an adverse result could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe face a variety of risks related to our proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business.\nWe plan to develop a battery-graphite manufacturing business that produces low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products for battery manufacturers. The proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business is significantly different from our historic mining operations and carries a number of risks, including, without limitation:\n\uf0b7the potential diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources, including available cash, from our existing mining business;\n\uf0b7unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, including those related to intellectual property;\n\uf0b7the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into the battery-graphite manufacturing business;\n\uf0b7competition from better-funded public and private companies, including from producers of synthetic graphite, and competition from foreign companies that are not subject to the same environmental and other regulations as the Company; and\n\uf0b7difficulty in hiring personnel or acquiring the intellectual property rights and know-how needed for the proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business.\n\u00b7\nThe potential for interruptions in our sources of graphite prior to operation of the Coosa graphite mine due to environmental and transportation risks\nEntry into a new line of business may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Further, our battery-graphite manufacturing business model and strategy are still evolving and are continually being reviewed and revised, and we may not be able to successfully implement our business model and strategy. We may not be able to produce graphite with the characteristics needed for battery production, and we may not be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers. Neither the Company nor any member of its management team has directly engaged in producing graphite or similar materials before, and our lack of experience may result in delays or further complications to the new business. If we are unable to successfully implement our new battery-graphite manufacturing business, our revenue and profitability may not grow as we expect, our competitiveness may be materially and adversely affected, and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nIn developing our proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development of our battery-graphite manufacturing business may not be achieved. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of our new battery-graphite manufacturing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe construction and operation of pilot plant facilities and commercial production facilities in Alabama or other manufacturing facilities are subject to regulatory approvals and may be subject to delays, cost overruns or may not produce expected benefits.\nWe plan to begin operation of a pilot plant for our battery-graphite manufacturing business in 2020, followed by construction of a commercial scale processing facility in 2022 that purifies readily available graphite flake concentrates from various sources to 99.95% pure carbon. Construction projects of this scale are subject to risks and will require significant capital. Any failure to complete these plants on schedule and within budget could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nConstruction projects are also subject to broad and strict government supervision and approval procedures, including but not limited to project approvals and filings, construction land and project planning approvals, environment protection approvals, pollution discharge permits, work safety approvals and the completion of inspection and acceptance by relevant authorities. As a result, we may be subject to administrative uncertainty, fines or the suspension of work on such projects. To the extent we are unable to successfully complete construction on time or at all, our ability to develop our proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business could be adversely affected, which in turn could impact our growth prospects.\nThe Company has no known lithium or vanadium mineral reserves and it may not find any lithium or vanadium and, even if it finds lithium or vanadium, it may not be in economic quantities.\nThe Company has no known lithium mineral reserves at its Columbus Basin Project in Nevada, or its Sal Rica Project in Utah, and no known vanadium mineral reserves at its Coosa Project in Alabama. Additionally, even if the Company finds lithium or vanadium in sufficient quantities to warrant recovery, it ultimately may not be recoverable. Finally, even if any lithium or vanadium is recoverable, the Company does not know whether recovery can be done at a profit. Our lithium and vanadium activities are highly prospective and may not result in any benefit to the Company.\nBecause of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in new mineral exploration ventures, the Company\u2019s lithium and vanadium exploration activities face a high risk of business failure.\nPotential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration ventures and the high rate of failure of such ventures. The likelihood of success of the Company\u2019s lithium and vanadium exploration activities must be considered in light of the potential problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of new mineral properties. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. The expenditures to be made by the Company in the exploration of its new lithium or vanadium claims may not result in the discovery of lithium or vanadium deposits. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in new mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. If the results of the Company\u2019s new exploration ventures do not reveal viable commercial mineralization, it may decide to abandon its claims. If this happens, the Company will not benefit from any of the expenditures it will incur in pursuing the claims.\nThe benefits of integrating WWR and Alabama Graphite may not be realized.\nTo be successful on a going forward basis, we will need to combine and integrate the operations of WWR and Alabama Graphite into one company. Integration will require substantial management attention and could detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. We could encounter difficulties in the integration process, such as the need to revisit assumptions about future production, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs, including synergies, the loss of key employees or commercial relationships or the need to address unanticipated liabilities. If we cannot integrate WWR\u2019s and Alabama Graphite\u2019s businesses successfully, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of our acquisition of Alabama Graphite.\nCertain of our mineral properties may be subject to defects in title and we are at risk of loss of ownership.\nMany of our mining properties are unpatented mining claims to which we have only possessory title. The validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain and such validity is always subject to contest. Unpatented mining claims are generally considered subject to greater title risk than patented mining claims or other real property interests that are owned in fee simple. Because unpatented mining claims are self-initiated and self-maintained, they possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests. It is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims from public real property records, and, therefore, it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location, perfection and maintenance of an unpatented mining claim. The present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the exclusive right to remove locatable minerals, such as graphite, vanadium, lithium and uranium. We are also allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral-bearing ores. However, legal ownership of the public land remains with the federal government. We remain at risk that the mining claims may be lost either to the federal government or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements. In addition, we may not have, or may not be able to obtain, all necessary surface rights to develop a property.\nWe may incur significant costs related to defending the title to our properties. A successful claim contesting our title to a property may cause us to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property or lose our rights to explore and develop that property. This could result in us not being compensated for our prior expenditures relating to the property.\nExploration and development of graphite, lithium vanadium and uranium properties are risky and subject to great uncertainties.\nThe exploration for and development of graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium deposits involves significant risks. It is impossible to ensure that the current and future exploration programs on our existing properties will establish reserves. Whether an ore body will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium prices, which cannot be predicted and which have been highly volatile in the past; mining, processing and transportation costs; perceived levels of political risk and the willingness of lenders and investors to provide project financing; availability of labor, labor costs and possible labor strikes; availability of drilling rigs; and governmental regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting materials, foreign exchange, environmental protection, employment, worker safety, transportation, and reclamation and closure obligations. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of minerals and there can be no assurance that any of our exploration stage properties will be commercially mineable or can be brought into production.\nWe may enter into acquisitions, dispositions or other material transactions at any time.\nWe are regularly engaged in a review of opportunities to acquire or dispose of properties, to partner with other companies on projects or to acquire or merge with companies. We currently, and generally at any time, have such opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and participation in discussions or negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions. Any such acquisition or disposition could be material to us. We could issue common stock or incur additional indebtedness to fund our acquisitions. Issuances of common stock may dilute existing holders of our securities. In addition, any such acquisition, disposition or other transaction may have other transaction specific risks associated with it, including risks related to the completion of the transaction, the project or the jurisdictions in which the project is located. We could enter into one or more acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions at any time.\nThe developments at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan continue to have a negative impact on the uranium markets and public acceptance of nuclear energy is uncertain.\nThe developments at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake and tsunami that struck parts of Japan in March 2011 created heightened concerns regarding the safety of nuclear power plants and the ability to safeguard the material used to fuel nuclear power plants. The impact on the perception of the safety of nuclear power resulting from this event may cause increased volatility of uranium prices as well as uncertainty involving the continued use and expansion of nuclear power in certain countries. A reduction in the current or the future generation of electricity from nuclear power could result in a reduced requirement for uranium to fuel nuclear power plants which may negatively impact WWR in the future.\nMaintaining the demand for uranium at current levels and future growth in demand will depend upon acceptance of nuclear technology as a means of generating electricity. The developments at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant may affect public acceptance of nuclear technology. Lack of public acceptance of nuclear technology would adversely affect the demand for nuclear power and potentially increase the regulation of the nuclear power industry.\nThe only significant market for uranium is nuclear power plants world-wide, and there are a limited number of customers; the nuclear power industry continues to experience an overproduction of uranium.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of electric utilities that buy uranium for nuclear power plants. Because of the limited market for uranium, a reduction in purchases of newly produced uranium by electric utilities for any reason (such as plant closings) would adversely affect the viability of our business.\nSince 2011, the nuclear power industry continues to experience an overproduction of uranium along with high inventories of uranium in various stages of production as a fuel source. These factors impact our position in the market and can adversely impact our business.\nThe price of alternative energy sources affects the demand for and price of uranium.\nThe attractiveness of uranium as an alternative fuel to generate electricity may be dependent on the relative prices of oil, gas, coal, hydro-electricity, renewals and the possibility of developing other low-cost sources of energy. If the prices of alternative energy sources decrease or new low-cost alternative energy sources are developed, the demand for uranium could decrease, which may result in a decrease in the price of uranium.\nThe Company\u2019s experience in uranium exploration may not apply to its plans for graphite, lithium and vanadium exploration or development.\nAlthough the Company and the members of its management team have significant experience in uranium exploration and development that appears to be synergistic with graphite, lithium and vanadium exploration and development, neither the Company nor any member of its management team has directly engaged in the exploration for or development of graphite, lithium or vanadium deposits. In particular, the Company believes there are similarities between the exploration for and development of lithium brines and the ISR of uranium, but it may not have sufficiently detailed expertise to effectively explore for and develop lithium deposits. The Company\u2019s lack of specific graphite, lithium and vanadium experience may lead it to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of its acquisition of Alabama Graphite or the Company\u2019s lithium and vanadium exploration and development activities and may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company may need to hire employees or retain consultants with the requisite experience in graphite production and lithium or vanadium exploration and development that are not currently anticipated in the near-term.\nVolatility in graphite, lithium and vanadium prices may make it commercially infeasible for the Company to develop its claims and may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nThe Company\u2019s graphite, lithium and vanadium exploration and development activities may be significantly adversely affected by volatility in the price of graphite, lithium or vanadium. Mineral prices fluctuate widely and are\naffected by numerous factors beyond its control such as global and regional supply and demand, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and foreign currencies, and the political and economic conditions of mineral-producing countries throughout the world. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in the Company\u2019s graphite, lithium and vanadium activities not producing an adequate return on invested capital to be profitable or viable.\nOur operations are each subject to environmental risks.\nWe are required to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations and permitting requirements in the United States, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future. We have expended significant resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations and permitting requirements, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future. The material laws and regulations within the U.S. include the Atomic Energy Act, Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (\u201cUMTRCA\u201d), Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Federal Land Policy Management Act, National Park System Mining Regulations Act, the State Mined Land Reclamation Acts or State Department of Environmental Quality regulations and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of the NEPA, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) as applicable.\nWe are required to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, as amended by UMTRCA, by applying for and maintaining an operating license from the NRC and the State of Texas. Uranium operations must conform to the terms of such licenses, which include provisions for protection of human health and the environment from endangerment due to radioactive materials. The licenses encompass protective measures consistent with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Mining operations may be subject to other laws administered by the EPA and other agencies.\nThe uranium industry is subject not only to the worker health and safety and environmental risks associated with all mining businesses, but also to additional risks uniquely associated with uranium ISR, mining and milling. The possibility of more stringent regulations exists in the areas of worker health and safety, storage of hazardous materials, standards for heavy equipment used in ISR, mining or milling, the disposition of wastes, the decommissioning and reclamation of exploration, mining and ISR sites, climate change and other environmental matters, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the cost or the viability of a particular project.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation, regulation or policy will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation, generally, is toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue in the future. This recent trend includes, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to air and water quality, reclamation, waste handling and disposal, the protection of certain species, the preservation of certain lands, and epidemics and pandemics to the degree they impact us or our activities. These regulations may require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for certain activities. These laws and regulations may also limit or prohibit activities on certain lands. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may necessitate significant capital outlays, may materially affect our results of operations and business or may cause material changes or delay to our intended activities.\nOur operations may require additional analysis in the future including environmental, cultural and social impact and other related studies. Certain activities require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and directors, officers and employees. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary permits that may be required to continue our operation or exploration of our properties or, if feasible, to commence development, construction or operation of mining facilities at such properties on terms which enable operations to be conducted at economically justifiable costs. If we are unable to obtain or maintain permits or water rights for development of our properties or otherwise fail to manage adequately future environmental issues, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nClosure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\nNatural resource companies are required to close their operations and remediate the lands in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and remediation costs for extractive operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and closure plans that may change materially. Any underestimated or unanticipated remediation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income in the related period.\nThe laws and regulations governing closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations.\nBecause mineral exploration and development activities are inherently risky, we may be exposed to environmental liabilities and other dangers. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance, or liabilities exceed the limits of our insurance policies, we may be unable to continue operations.\nThe business of mineral exploration and extraction involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into production. Unusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are other risks involved in extraction operations and the conduct of exploration programs. Previous mining operations may have caused environmental damage at certain of our properties. It may be difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by us or by the activities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and exemptions from liability may be ineffective. If any of our properties are found to have commercial quantities of minerals, we would be subject to additional risks respecting any development and production activities.\nAlthough we carry property and liability insurance with respect to our mineral development and exploration operations, we may become subject to liability for damage to life and property, environmental damage, cave-ins or hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of cost or other business reasons. In addition, the insurance industry is undergoing change and premiums are being increased. If we are unable to procure adequate insurance because of cost, unavailability or otherwise, we might be forced to cease operations.\nReserve and other mineralized material calculations are estimates only, and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including the prices of graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium in the recovery process.\nThe calculation of reserves, other mineralized material tons and grades are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and geostatistical relationships or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unpredictable. There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves and mineralized material and their corresponding grades. Until reserves and other mineralized materials are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of reserves and other mineralized materials may vary depending on the price of graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium. Any material change in the quantity of reserves, other mineralized materials, mineralization or grade may affect the economic viability of our properties.\nOur inability to obtain financial surety would threaten our ability to continue in business.\nFuture financial surety requirements to comply with federal and state environmental and remediation requirements and to secure necessary licenses and approvals will increase significantly as future development and production occurs at certain of our sites in the United States. The amount of the financial surety for each producing property is subject to annual review and revision by regulators. We expect that the issuer of the financial surety instruments will require us to provide cash collateral for a significant amount of the face amount of the bond to secure the obligation. In\nthe event we are not able to raise, secure or generate sufficient funds necessary to satisfy these requirements, we will be unable to develop our sites and bring them into production, which inability will have a material adverse impact on our business and may negatively affect our ability to continue to operate.\nCompetition from better-capitalized companies affects prices and our ability to acquire both properties and personnel.\nThere is global competition for graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium properties, capital, customers and the employment and retention of qualified personnel. In the production and marketing of graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium, there are a number of producing entities, some of which are government controlled and most of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. Many of these organizations also have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and distribution resources than we have.\nOur future uranium production will also compete with uranium recovered from the de-enrichment of highly enriched uranium obtained from the dismantlement of United States and Russian nuclear weapons and imports to the United States of uranium from the former Soviet Union and from the sale of uranium inventory held by the United States Department of Energy. In addition, there are numerous entities in the market that compete with us for properties and are attempting to become licensed to operate ISR and/or underground mining facilities. If we are unable to successfully compete for properties, capital, customers or employees or with alternative uranium sources, it could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause we have limited capital, inherent mining risks pose a significant threat to us compared with our larger competitors.\nBecause we have limited capital, we may be unable to withstand significant losses that can result from inherent risks associated with mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, flooding, earthquake, interruptions due to weather conditions and other acts of nature which larger competitors could withstand. Such risks could result in damage to or destruction of our infrastructure and production facilities, as well as to adjacent properties, personal injury, environmental damage and processing and production delays, causing monetary losses and possible legal liability. Our business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur business and mineral exploration programs depend upon our ability to employ the services of geologists, engineers and other experts. In operating our business and in order to continue our programs, we compete for the services of professionals with other mineral exploration companies and businesses. In addition, several entities have expressed an interest in hiring certain of our employees. Our ability to maintain and expand our business and continue our exploration programs may be impaired if we are unable to continue to employ or engage those parties currently providing services and expertise to us or identify and engage other qualified personnel to do so in their place. To retain key employees, we may face increased compensation costs, including potential new stock incentive grants and there can be no assurance that the incentive measures we implement will be successful in helping us retain our key personnel.\nThe Company has no history of paying dividends on its common stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company has not previously paid dividends on its common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nTerms of subsequent financings may adversely impact holders of our securities.\nIn order to finance our future production plans and working capital needs, we may have to raise funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Depending on the type and the terms of any financing we pursue, holders of our securities\u2019 rights and the value of their investment in our common stock could be reduced. A financing could involve one\nor more types of securities including common stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire common stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock. We currently have no authorized preferred stock. In addition, if we issue secured debt securities, the holders of the debt would have a claim to our assets that would be prior to the rights of holders of our other securities until the debt is paid. Interest on these debt securities would increase costs and negatively impact operating results. If the issuance of new securities results in diminished rights to holders of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn March 13, 2018, the Nasdaq Stock Market notified us that the Company did not meet Nasdaq\u2019s $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cRule\u201d) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On May 8, 2019, after we effected a one-for-fifty reverse split of our common stock following the close of trading on April 22, 2019, the Company received a written confirmation from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel that the Company had regained compliance with the Rule.\nWhile our common stock continues to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cWWR,\u201d there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements. If our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on Nasdaq, we expect that our common stock would be traded on the over-the-counter market.\nDelisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our common stock and negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. We could also face other adverse consequences if its common stock were delisted including, among others:\n\uf0b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\uf0b7 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\uf0b7 a limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for the Company; and\n\uf0b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3), the loss of the ability to issue securities in \u201cat-the-market\u201d offerings (including pursuant to the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement between the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.), or obtain additional financing in the future.\nShareholders would be diluted if we use common stock to raise capital, and the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe plan to seek additional capital to carry out our business plan. This financing could involve one or more types of securities including common stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire common stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock could be dilutive to existing holders of our securities and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOn June 6, 2019, we entered into the PA with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $10,000,000 of our common stock. The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the PA may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 24-month period commencing after the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the PA, which conditions were satisfied on June 24, 2019. We have previously received $6.5 million in aggregate gross proceeds from prior sales of 2.1 million shares under the PA. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the PA will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nAfter Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nThe effect of comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation on WWR and its affiliates, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among a number of significant changes to the current U.S. federal income tax rules, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the marginal U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limits the deduction for net interest expense, shifts the United States toward a more territorial tax system, and imposes new taxes to combat erosion of the U.S. federal income tax base. The effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on WWR and its affiliates, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.", "PERMNO": 75672, "SIC": 1090, "TIC": "WWR"}
