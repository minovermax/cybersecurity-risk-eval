{"cik": "1613665", "company": "Great Western Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before investing in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and/or financial condition. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information in this report, or in other reports we file with the SEC, constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors below are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nEconomic Risk\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global economic downturn which has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition remain uncertain.\nCOVID-19, which has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, continues to cause economic disruption both worldwide and in the markets we operate, as well as a destabilization effect on financial markets. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 are uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent of these impacts will depend on future developments, including among others, governmental, regulatory and private sector actions and responses, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, and actions taken to contain or prevent further spread, each of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOur business is dependent upon the ability and willingness of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions, including the payment of loan obligations. COVID-19 has and continues to disrupt the business, activities, and operations of our customers, which may cause a decline in demand for our products and services which may, in turn, result in a significant decrease in our business, negatively impacting our liquidity position and financial results. Our financial results could also be impacted due to an inability of our customers to meet their loan commitments because of their losses associated with the effects of COVID-19, resulting in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, declining collateral values and other losses to our Bank. Moreover, current and future governmental action may temporarily require the Company to conduct business differently with respect to foreclosures, repossessions, payments, deferrals and other customer-related transactions.\nAlthough the Company has established a pandemic response plan and procedures, our workforce has been, is, and may continue to be impacted by COVID-19. We are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers, including temporary branch and office closures, but no assurance can be given that our actions will be adequate or appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees\u2019 ability to provide customer support and service. The spread could also negatively impact availability of key personnel and employee productivity, as well as the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for us, which could adversely impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers.\nEconomic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of our borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services that we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; terrorist attacks; or a combination of these or other factors.\nAn economic downturn or sustained, high unemployment levels, and stock market volatility may negatively impact our operating results and have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans increasing the risk of loan defaults and losses.\nChanges in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our earnings, as the ability of our borrowers to repay loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, declines.\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic or political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, inflation, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels, and loan demand and, therefore, our earnings. Because we have a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. In addition, substantially all of our loans are to individuals and businesses in our market area. Consequently, any economic decline in our primary market areas, which include Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our Company\u2019s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere continues to be discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products, could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt; which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nOn October 1, 2018, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to a new trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The USMCA entered into force on July 1, 2020. The full impact of the USMCA on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in our states is currently unknown and, thus, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk which, among other things, could affect our earnings and the value of certain of our assets.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on net interest income. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, and, in particular, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect: (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including our securities portfolio; and (iii) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2020, 46.5% of our loans were advanced to our customers on a variable or adjustable-rate basis and another 6.5% of our loans were advanced to our customers on a fixed-rate basis where we utilized derivative instruments to swap our economic exposure to a variable-rate basis. As a result, an increase in interest rates could result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs and could necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a decrease in interest rates could negatively impact our margins and profitability.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had $2.59 billion of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and $8.42 billion of interest-bearing demand deposits. If we need to offer higher interest rates on checking accounts to maintain current clients or attract new clients, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer interest in a sufficient amount to keep these demand deposits, our core deposits may be reduced, which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or risk slowing our future asset growth.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings.\nOur Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, our Bank is subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control the amount of premiums our Bank will be required to pay for FDIC insurance. As our Bank has exceeded $10 billion in assets, the method for calculating its FDIC assessments has changed and our Bank\u2019s FDIC assessments have increased as a result. See \"Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Deposit Insurance.\" In fiscal year 2020, our deposit insurance premium increased $3.2 million, primarily as a result of the impairment of goodwill recognized during the period. If there is an increase in financial institution failures, or a decrease in the performance of our Bank, our Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums, or the FDIC may charge additional special assessments. Future increases of FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit and Interest Rate Risk\nWe focus on originating business and agricultural loans which may involve greater risk than residential mortgage lending.\nWe originate commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, agricultural real estate loans, agricultural loans, consumer loans, and residential real estate loans primarily within our market areas. Commercial real estate, commercial, consumer, and agricultural real estate and operating loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u2022Commercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating and debt service.\n\u2022Commercial Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\n\u2022Consumer Loans. Consumer Loans (such as personal lines of credit) are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment on the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss.\n\u2022Agricultural Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business, which is greatly dependent on many things outside our control or the borrowers. These factors include weather, input costs, commodity and land prices and interest rates.\nAs of September 30, 2020, our business lending, which consists of our CRE and commercial non-real estate loans, represented approximately $7.46 billion, or 73.8%, of our loan portfolio. Our CRE loans secured by owner-occupied property and commercial non-real estate loans secured by business assets and guarantees from owners, which together form the core of our business banking focus, totaled approximately $3.59 billion, or 35.5%, of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2020, with undisbursed loan commitments for these loans amounting to an additional $929.6 million. We also had approximately $3.86 billion of other CRE loans (i.e., construction and development loans, multifamily residential real estate loans and CRE loans secured by commercial property that is not owner-occupied) at September 30, 2020, or 38.2% of our loan portfolio.\nWithin our CRE and commercial non-real estate loan portfolio we have identified the following segments with elevated risk: hotels & resorts with $1.21 billion, or 12.0% of our loan portfolio, restaurants with $156.5 million, or 1.6% of our loan portfolio, arts and entertainment with $130.3 million, or 1.3% of our loan portfolio, senior care with $330.7 million, or 3.3% of our loan portfolio, and skilled nursing with $250.9 million, or 2.5% of our loan portfolio, for a total exposure of $2.07 billion, or 20.7% of our loan portfolio.\nAt September 30, 2020, our agricultural loans, consisting primarily of agricultural operating loans (e.g., loans to farm and ranch owners and operators) and agricultural real estate loans, were $1.72 billion, representing 17.1% of our total loan portfolio. At September 30, 2020, agricultural operating loans totaled $886.8 million, or 8.8% of our loan portfolio; and agricultural real estate loans totaled $837.5 million, or 8.3%, of our loan portfolio. The primary livestock of our customers to whom we have extended agricultural loans include dairy cows, hogs and feeder cattle, and the primary crops of our customers to whom we have extended agricultural loans include corn, soybeans and, to a lesser extent, wheat and cotton. In addition, we estimate that 7.6% of our commercial non-real estate loans and owner-occupied CRE loans were agriculture-related loans at September 30, 2020.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the real estate markets where we operate, as a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate.\nAt September 30, 2020, 68.6% of our aggregate loan portfolio, comprising our CRE loans (representing 52.2% of our aggregate loan portfolio), residential real estate loans (representing 8.1% of our aggregate loan portfolio) and agriculture real estate loans (representing 8.3% of our aggregate loan portfolio), was primarily secured by interests in real estate predominantly located in the states in which we operate. In addition, some of our other lending occasionally involves taking real estate as primary or secondary collateral. Real property values in these states may be different from, and in some instances worse than, real property values in other markets or in the United States as a whole, and may be affected by a variety of factors outside of our control and the control of our borrowers, including national and local economic conditions generally. Declines in real property prices, including prices for homes, commercial properties and farmland, in the states in which we operate could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, and reduced demand for our products and services generally. Our CRE loans, in particular, totaled approximately $5.27 billion at September 30, 2020, or 52.2% of our loan portfolio, and may have a greater risk of loss than residential mortgage loans, in part because these loans are generally larger or more complex to underwrite, monitor and service. Agricultural real estate loans may be affected by similar factors to those that affect agricultural loans generally, including adverse weather conditions, disease and declines in the market prices for agricultural products or farm real estate. In addition, declines in real property values in the states in which we operate could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on these loans and could adversely affect our ability to continue to grow our loan portfolio consistent with our underwriting standards. Our failure to effectively mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk.\nThe operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In order to successfully manage credit risk, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our bankers follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, our inability to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers may negatively impact the quality of our loan portfolio, result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn important feature of our credit risk management system is our use of analytical and forecasting models in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, estimating the effects of economic conditions on our loan portfolio, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy and regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Those models reflect certain assumptions about both quantitative and qualitative factors, including among others, interest rates and consumer behavior that may be incorrect. If our analytical and forecasting models' underlying assumptions are incorrect, improperly applied, or otherwise inadequate, we may suffer deleterious effects such as higher than expected loan losses, lower than expected net interest income, lower than expected liquidity, lower than expected capital or unanticipated charge-offs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our actual loan losses exceed our allowance for loan losses, our net income will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans. Despite our underwriting and monitoring practices, the effect of a declining economy could negatively impact the ability of our borrowers to repay loans in a timely manner and could also negatively impact collateral values. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Since we must use assumptions regarding individual loans and the economy, our current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. Our assumptions may not anticipate the severity or duration of the current credit cycle; and we may need to significantly increase our provision for losses on loans if one or more of our larger loans or credit relationships becomes delinquent or if we expand our commercial real estate and commercial lending.\nAdditionally, subsequent to this fiscal year-end we adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cCECL\u201d) effective October 1, 2020. This standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. This changes the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that are probable, which requires us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge-offs. For additional discussion, see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-2. New Accounting Standards.\" Material additions to our allowance through provision expense would materially decrease our net income. There can be no assurance that our monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our Bank branches and any real estate collateral we acquire upon foreclosure.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. The costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, including damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating foreclosure, these actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards.\nWe also have an extensive branch network, owning separate branch locations throughout the areas we serve that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and could materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with mortgage loan servicing standards, guidelines, laws and regulations, including the CARES Act, may result in substantial penalties, additional costs or losses.\nAs a residential mortgage servicer in the U.S., we have a portfolio of loan servicing rights. A loan servicing right is the right to service a mortgage loan (ie: collect principal, interest and escrow amounts) for a fee. The housing GSE, such as FNMA, the FHLMC and the FHLB, that own the mortgages that we service in our loan servicing rights portfolio have mortgage servicing standards. HUD and state housing finance agencies govern and establish guidelines for the servicing of GSE mortgages. The failure to comply with these standards and guidelines, as well as other applicable federal and state laws and regulations, could result in penalties assessed by HUD, the GSEs and/or our other regulators, or we could be forced to sell all or part of our loan servicing rights portfolio. In addition, we are subject to certain legal and contractual requirements for how we hold, transfer, use or enforce promissory notes, security instruments and other documents for residential mortgage loans that we service. Further, we currently use MERS for our servicing efforts. If documentation requirements were not met, or if the use of MERS or the MERS system is found not valid or effective, we could be obligated to, or choose to, take remedial actions and may be subject to additional costs or losses.\nAs a result of the CARES Act and associated regulations, customers of a federally backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie and Fannie) experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic have the ability to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower\u2019s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency which includes granting a forbearance or deferral with no additional fees, penalties or interest, and with no adverse effects on the borrower\u2019s credit. Foreclosures and evictions are prohibited during timeframes set by the GSEs. The Bank established new and updated existing policies, procedures and a change management process to facilitate the new CARES Act requirements, however, due to the extremely short implementation timeframes, and some ambiguity in the regulations, we are exposed to risks relating to noncompliance, and/or risk that errors may occur, subjecting the Bank to further regulatory, litigation, and/or operational risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on the mortgage secondary market for some of our liquidity.\nWe originate and sell a majority of our residential mortgage loans and their servicing rights, including $496.9 million of predominantly fixed rate residential mortgage loans sold during fiscal year 2020. This does not include the loan servicing portfolio acquired from HF Financial, approximately $389.3 million, and portfolio loans consisting of ARMs and other non-conforming loans of approximately $830.1 million, each at September 30, 2020. We rely on FNMA and other purchasers to purchase loans in order to reduce our credit risk and provide funding for additional loans we desire to originate. We cannot provide assurance that these purchasers will not materially limit their purchases from us due to capital constraints or other factors, including, with respect to FNMA, a change in the criteria for conforming loans. Any reforms to the U.S. residential mortgage finance market, including the role of FNMA, which are not yet known, may limit our ability to sell conforming loans to FNMA. Our inability to comply with all federal and state regulations and investor guidelines regarding the origination, underwriting documentation and servicing of residential mortgage loans may also impact our ability to continue selling residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, effecting our ability to fund, and thus originate, additional residential mortgage loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct.\nIf any of our representations and warranties to a purchaser about our mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated and serviced is incorrect, we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be required to repurchase or provide substitute mortgage loans for part or all of the affected loans. We may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. If repurchase or indemnity activity becomes material, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may also, from time to time, engage in selling or participating all or part of certain commercial, agricultural or other types of loans. Such sales entail similar risks to those described above.\nUncertainty relating to LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nLoans that we make through certain federal programs are dependent on the federal government\u2019s continuation and support of these programs and on our compliance with their requirements.\nWe participate in various U.S. government agency guarantee programs, including programs operated by the United States Department of Agriculture, Small Business Administration, Farm Service Administration and the United States Department of the Interior. If we fail to follow any applicable regulations, guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program, any loans we originate as part of that program may lose the associated guarantee, exposing us to credit risk we would not otherwise be exposed to or underwritten, or result in our inability to continue originating loans under such programs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal and state governments have enacted laws intending to stimulate the economy in light of the business and market disruptions related to COVID-19, including the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d). Our Bank participated as a lender in both rounds of the PPP, providing $727.3 million in loans to over 4,800 customers. We understand that PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and believe the majority of these loans will be forgiven. However, there can be no assurance that the borrowers will use or have used the funds appropriately or will have satisfied the staffing or payment requirements to qualify for forgiveness in whole or in part. Any portion of the loan that is not forgiven must be repaid by the borrower. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by our Bank, which may or may not be related to an ambiguity in the laws, rules or guidance regarding operation of the PPP, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if we have already been paid under the guaranty, seek recovery from us of any loss related to the deficiency. Several other large banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. We and our Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans and our PPP process. If any such litigation is filed against the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information, or from those customers or counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, fraudulent or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could result in loan and lease losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCOVID-19 could have negative effects on our hospitality and CRE loans, including loans to hotels, restaurants and health care facilities, which are dependent for repayment on the successful operation and management of the CRE, the strength of the CRE industry broadly and other factors outside of the borrower\u2019s control.\nIn response to COVID-19, many state and local governments have ordered certain restrictions on non-essential businesses and residents. Certain industries have been particularly hard hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. At September 30, 2020, we had outstanding loans to hotels & resorts of $1.21 billion, or 12.0% of total loans, restaurants of $156.5 million, or 1.6% of total loans, arts and entertainment of $130.3 million, or 1.3% of total loans, senior care of $330.7 million, or 3.3% of total loans, and skilled nursing of $250.9 million, or 2.5% of total loans, for a total exposure of $2.07 billion, or 20.7% of total loans. Our CRE loans are dependent on the profitable operation and management of the property securing the loan and its cash flows. The continued spread of COVID-19 could result in further reduction of demand for hotel rooms and related lodging and entertainment services in general, reduction in business and personal travel, reduction in discretionary spending by our borrowers\u2019 customers, increases in employee health related costs for our customers, operational cost increases due to potential labor, food, energy, water, transportation shortages, government forced closures and travel restrictions, or other unanticipated costs related to such force majeure events like COVID-19. These conditions can also lead to a decline in property sales prices and related assets and properties planned for development. Revenues may decline more quickly than borrowers are able to reduce expenses.\nIf repercussions of the outbreak are prolonged, COVID-19 could have a significant adverse impact, which could be material to our borrowers, by reducing the revenue and cash flows of our borrowers, impacting the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loan, increasing the risk of default by our borrowers and/or reducing the foreclosure value of CRE that serves as collateral for certain of our loans. Loans may also be secured by depreciating assets where any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact our borrowers, and their financial results, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in the Company's Securities\nThe value of securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we owned $1.77 billion of investment securities. The fair value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio. We analyze our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is now subject to additional regulatory restrictions and we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on our receipt of dividends from our Bank, the payment of which is subject to numerous limitations under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. See \"Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Dividends.\" As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. In addition, as a bank holding company our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. Due to negative retained earnings, primarily as a result of $713.0 million of impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets, net of tax, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company and our Bank are now required to notify the FRB and the FDIC and SDDB, respectively, prior to declaring and paying a cash dividend from our Bank to the Company and to our shareholders.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, our Board of Directors reduced our dividend paid in the third fiscal quarter to $0.15 per share, from $0.30 per share paid in the second fiscal quarter, and then further reduced the dividend paid to $0.01 per share in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily as a result of the uncertainties and impacts of COVID-19. Any further changes in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof by our Board of Directors could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely as a publicly listed company if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could result in a suspension or delisting of our common stock from the NYSE.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, in the form of additional debt or equity, in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, as well as on acceptable terms, if needed, will depend on, among other things, our credit rating, confidence of debt purchasers, conditions in the capital markets at that time, counterparties participating in the capital markets or other disruption in capital markets and our financial condition. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve System. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may need to compete for investors when seeking to raise capital. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have been rated as \"BBB\" with a negative outlook by Kroll Bond Rating Agency (\u201cKBRA\u201d). A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Our creditworthiness is not fixed and should be expected to change over time as a result of our performance and industry conditions. We cannot give any assurances that our credit ratings will remain at current levels, and it is possible that our ratings could be lowered or withdrawn by KBRA. Any actual or threatened downgrade or withdrawal of our credit rating could affect our perception in the marketplace and our ability to raise capital, and could increase our debt financing costs.\nFuture issues or sales of our capital stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nAny capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the issues or sales of a large number of shares of our capital stock or from the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOn June 1, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an indeterminate amount of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and debt securities which we may decide to issue in the future. To the extent that we choose to issue our common stock or our preferred stock, or rights relating to our common stock or preferred stock (through the issuance of depositary shares), such issuances will increase the number of our shares of capital stock outstanding and the holders of these shares will be able to sell them in the public market. The specific terms of any shares of capital stock that may be issued under our shelf registration statement will be determined by us prior to issuance based on current market conditions and will be described in a supplement to the prospectus contained in such registration statement.\nWe have filed a registration statement with the SEC registering 1,497,222 shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to awards granted under our equity incentive plans. We have granted awards covering 1,137,092 shares of our common stock under these plans as of September 30, 2020. Subject to stockholder approval, we may increase the number of shares registered for this purpose from time to time. Once we issue these shares, their holders will be able to sell them in the public market.\nCertain banking laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution, including shares of our common stock, generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \"controls\" the bank holding company or depository institution and the acquisition of such control would be subject to federal regulatory approval. In addition, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including our Bank.\nThere also are provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, such as limitations on the ability to call a special meeting of our stockholders, and the classification of our Board of Directors into three separate classes each serving for three-year terms, that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. In addition, our Board of Directors is authorized under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to issue shares of preferred stock, and determine the rights, terms, conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without stockholder approval. These provisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have also elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which generally prohibits a person qualifying as an \"interested stockholder\" from entering into a transaction for a business combination with us unless, subject to certain exceptions, such transaction is first approved by our Board of Directors. An \"interested stockholder\" is generally defined as any person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. The purpose of this election is to provide our Board of Directors with leverage in negotiating with an interested stockholder desiring to pursue a business combination with us by making it more difficult for such stockholder to complete such transaction in the absence of board approval. This election may discourage certain take-over attempts which our stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests and this, in turn, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our Bank in times of stress.\nUnder federal law and longstanding Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our Bank, and to commit resources to support our Bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our Bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our stockholders\u2019 or creditors\u2019, best interests to do so. Providing such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our Bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our Bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of our Bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future.\nWe are subject to current and changing regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain, which if we fail, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and we may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nIn particular, the capital requirements applicable to us under the recently adopted Capital Rules implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States started to be phased-in on January 1, 2015. While we expect to meet the requirements of the new Basel III-based Capital Rules, we may fail to do so. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.\nStrategic Risks\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or an adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nIn our markets, we face significant competition from other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies and other financial institutions, particularly nationwide and regional banks and larger community banking institutions. We also face competition for agricultural loans from participants in the nationwide Farm Credit System and global banks. In addition, FinTech's are emerging in key areas of banking. Our competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. Many of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas and, in some cases, lower cost structures. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete in our markets.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Our inability to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plan or manage our growth.\nOur growth strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions and requires us to manage several different elements simultaneously. Sustainable growth requires that we manage our risks by balancing loan and deposit growth at acceptable levels of risk, maintaining adequate liquidity and capital, hiring and retaining qualified employees, successfully managing the costs and implementation risks with respect to strategic projects and initiatives, and integrating acquisition targets and managing the costs. Our growth strategy may also change from time to time as a result of various internal and external factors. Our inability to manage our growth successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy includes consideration of potential acquisition opportunities that we believe support our business strategy and may enhance our profitability. We face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions and there is no assurance that, following any mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, we will achieve profits comparable to, or better than, our historical experience. Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022the time, expense and diversion of management attention associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition targets and new markets and negotiating potential transactions;\n\u2022the accuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, funding, liquidity, liabilities, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022the risk that the acquired business will not perform to our expectations, including a failure to realize anticipated synergies or cost savings;\n\u2022difficulties, inefficiencies or cost overruns in integrating and assimilating the organizational cultures, operations, technologies, data, services and products of the acquired business with ours;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees or customers;\n\u2022our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders; and\n\u2022the potential for liabilities and claims arising out of the acquired businesses or closing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by shareholders of targets.\nFailed bank acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring operating banks even though the FDIC might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing in exposure to loan and lease losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution. However, because these acquisitions are typically conducted by the FDIC in a manner that does not allow the time typically taken for a due diligence review or for preparing the integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks in transactions with the FDIC. These risks include, among other things, accuracy or completeness of due diligence materials, the loss of core deposits and strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks encountered in connection with such acquisitions, nor that any FDIC-assisted opportunities will be available to us in our markets. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a bank or bank holding company. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We may be required to sell banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. Bank regulators consider a number of factors when determining whether to approve a proposed transaction, including the effect of the transaction on financial stability and the ratings and compliance history of all institutions involved, including the CRA, examination results and anti-money-laundering and BSA compliance records of all institutions involved. Failure to comply with such requirements could also have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing delay in approval or denial of such transactions when regulatory approval is required, or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.\nOur ability to maintain, attract and retain customer relationships is highly dependent on our reputation.\nDamage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends on customer service and mitigation of the various risks described herein, as well as on identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, privacy, employee, customer and other third party fraud, record-keeping, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, successfully preventing third parties from infringing on the \"Great Western Bank\" brand and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property and avoiding adverse publicity or negative information regarding our Company, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. Defense of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, could result in material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB, SEC and other regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements, potentially requiring us to modify certain of the assumptions or estimates we have previously used in preparing our financial statements, negatively impacting how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and the Impact of Accounting Estimates.\"\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting techniques.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with U.S. GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include, but are not limited to, the allowance for loan and lease losses, valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, goodwill impairment, investment impairments, core deposits and other intangibles, derivatives and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses or sustain loan and lease losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; recognize significant impairment on goodwill and other intangible asset balances; reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value; or significantly increase our accrued tax liability. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and the Impact of Accounting Estimates.\"\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial institutions.\nWithin the financial services industry, loss of public confidence, including through default by any one institution, could lead to liquidity challenges or to defaults by other institutions as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risks are inherent in our business, including existing and new lines of business, products and services; and internal controls, processes and procedures that may fail or be circumvented.\nOur operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations, and to establish and maintain products and services that operationally function accurately and correctly. Although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, policies, procedures, corporate governance and substantial resources devoted to developing efficient procedures, identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff, the foregoing can only provide reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure, circumvention or weakness in these systems or controls, or any actual or alleged violations of laws or regulations, could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, enforcement actions, reputational impact or legal proceedings and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Such failure, circumventions or weakness could necessitate changes to our controls, processes and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations could be interrupted if certain external vendors on which we rely experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking laws and regulations.\nWe depend to a significant extent on relationships with third party service providers. Specifically, we utilize third party core banking services and receive credit card and debit card services, branch capture services, Internet banking services and services complementary to our banking products from various third party service providers. These types of third party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements where we must maintain and continue to enhance our due diligence and ongoing monitoring and control over our third party vendors. We may be required to renegotiate our agreements to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs. If our service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them, our operations could be interrupted. It may be difficult for us to timely replace some of our service providers, which may be at a higher cost due to the unique services they provide. A third party provider may fail to provide the services we require, or meet contractual requirements, comply with applicable laws and regulations, or suffer a cyber attack or other security breach. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies of our third party relationships which could result in enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines, or customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to employee management, conduct and compensation.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the skills of our management team and our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key officers and employees that may be difficult to replace. We cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur. Our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business may require us to offer compensation, including incentive based compensation, and benefits which could reduce our earnings. In addition, such arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations such as the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other laws now and in the future, which prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking. Deficiencies identified could lead to diminished supervisory ratings, enforcement actions and legal and reputational risk. For more information see \"Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Incentive Compensation.\"\nDue to competition and other factors, we may have difficulty recruiting qualified personnel, including uniquely qualified banking personnel to provide relationship based commercial and agribusiness banking services, to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. We may also fail to detect and prevent fraudulent, illegal or wrongful activities by our employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, and these models may be inaccurate or misinterpreted.\nWe rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business, including liquidity and capital planning, customer selection, credit and other risk management, pricing, reserving and collections management. The models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect. The errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material, and could lead us to make wrong or sub-optimal decisions in managing our business, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"-Our business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk\" for more information on models utilized in credit activities.\nRisks Related to Legal, Reputational and Compliance Matters\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities.\nOur business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks as a result of a number of factors, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry generally. In the normal course of business, we are periodically involved in claims and related litigation from our customers, employees or other parties. These claims and legal actions, whether meritorious or not, as well as reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies could involve large monetary claims and significant legal expense and may negatively impact our reputation in the marketplace and lessen customer demand. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under federal and state laws and regulations, and payment card industry operating regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. We are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve, and our Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, the SD Division of Banking and the CFPB. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments we may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves our Bank must hold against deposits it takes, the types of deposits our Bank may accept and the rates it may pay on such deposits, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in the control of us and our Bank, restrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices by our Bank. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, and there can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require will be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators also have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with payment card operating regulations could result in termination of our license to use the payment card networks. Failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations continue to undergo substantial change. Financial institutions generally have also been subjected to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities which may result in increased costs of doing business, decreased revenues and net income, reductions in our ability to effectively compete to attract and retain customers, or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. Any future changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, impact the regulatory structure under which we operate, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and modify our business strategy, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements as our total assets exceed $10 billion.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve\u2019s enhanced prudential oversight requirements, more restrictive interchange revenue and a more frequent and enhanced regulatory examination regime. In addition, banks, including ours, with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, with the FDIC maintaining supervision over some consumer related regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is some uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business. Compliance with these requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to the CRA, fair lending, consumer compliance, and other laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose non-discriminatory lending and other requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies, including the FDIC and CFPB, are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending and other compliance laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. The costs of defending, and any adverse outcome from, any such challenge could damage our reputation or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our Bank received an overall rating of \"satisfactory\" in its most recently completed CRA examination.\nViolations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorney's fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorney generals and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, enforcement actions, customer rescission rights and civil money penalties in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in delays or restrictions on mergers and acquisitions and expansionary activities we may wish to pursue.\nFailure to comply with the USA PATRIOT ACT, OFAC, the BSA and related FinCEN and FFIEC Guidelines and regulations could result in material implications.\nRegulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with the USA PATRIOT ACT, OFAC, the BSA and related FinCEN and FFIEC Guidelines. Certain of our products we offer may expose us to enhanced risk in the event of noncompliance, including and not limited to providing our treasury management services to certain money transmitters and money services businesses. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs as required by these obligations to combat terrorist financing, elder abuse, human trafficking, anti-money laundering and other suspicious activity and to fully comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for us, causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and significant civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these regulations.\nRisks Related to Privacy and Technology\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things requires privacy disclosures, and maintenance of a robust security program that are increasingly subject to change which could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. New or changes to existing laws increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives, including increased privacy-related enforcement activity, higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our regulators also hold us responsible for privacy and data protection obligations performed by our third party service providers while providing services to us. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInterruptions, cyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the normal course of business, we directly or through third parties collect, store, share, process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. We devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems, against damage from fires, other natural disasters; power or telecommunications failures; acts of terrorism or wars or other catastrophic events; breaches, physical break-ins or errors resulting in interruptions and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, through information security and business continuity programs. Notwithstanding, our facilities and systems, and those of third party service providers, are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, force majeure events, or other similar events.\nIncreased use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and operations, coupled with the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others increases our security risks. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers continue to engage in attacks against large financial institutions. These attacks include denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customer facing services, and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nThe access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets, failures or disruptions in our communications, information and technology systems, or our failure to adequately address them, could negatively affect our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan or other systems. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions of our communications, information and technology systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We could be required to provide notices of security breaches. Such failures could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, our payment cards, products and services, and negative effects on our brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven products and services which increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. Such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or new pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. Because of the concentration of agricultural loans in our lending portfolio and the volume of our borrowers in regions dependent on agriculture, we could be disproportionately affected relative to others in the case of external events such as floods, droughts and hail affecting the agricultural conditions in the markets we serve. The occurrence of any of these events in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to tax liabilities that are larger than we anticipate.\nThe tax laws applicable to our business activities, including the laws of the United States, South Dakota and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and may change over time. From time to time, legislative initiatives, such as corporate tax rate changes, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets or our tax positions or liabilities, may be enacted. The taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or by changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. We are subject to audit and review by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other liabilities requires significant judgment by management. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.", "PERMNO": 14969, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "GWB"}
