{"cik": "102752", "company": "VSE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur future results may differ materially from past results and from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K due to various uncertainties and risks, including those risks set forth below, nonrecurring events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other reports filed with the SEC.\nOperational Risks\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected and could in the future continue to adversely affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying levels of reductions in demand for our products and services, particularly in the aviation aftermarket. The global aviation market is experiencing a significant decline, specifically in global commercial air travel, which is having a significant impact on the parts distribution and maintenance, repair and overhaul services markets supporting general aviation and commercial aircraft. Our Aviation segment experienced the most impactful reduction in demand for our products and services during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, as a decline in commercial aircraft revenue passenger miles contributed to a reduction in demand for aftermarket parts and MRO services. We expect this reduction in demand to continue throughout the first half of 2021. This decrease in demand will adversely impact our operating results for 2021. We cannot estimate with certainty the severity of this impact, but we expect it to be consistent with overall aviation industry trends.\nWe operate numerous \u201ctouch labor\u201d warehouse and maintenance facilities supporting each of our three business segments both in our own facilities and customer facilities. A local outbreak of the virus in any of these facilities could temporarily shut down operations at those facilities until they have been thoroughly cleaned. Employees who become exposed to the virus would need to be quarantined and would be unable to work for 14 days or longer. Similarly, customers who have warehouse or maintenance facilities could be impacted, slowing or reducing demand for our parts distribution services.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 and decisions by our customers to delay the use of, or permanently retire, certain aircraft, demand levels for aviation disruption inventory could decrease in the near term or midterm, which could result in a write-down of existing inventory to adjust to current market trends and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, as a result of COVID-19, some of our commercial customers in the Aviation segment have been and could continue to be negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand, which has led to delays and could lead to defaults on collections of receivables from them. Such continued delays could further negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and while we expect it to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent, nature or duration of these impacts at this time, although we expect such negative impacts to continue in the first half of 2021.\nCertain programs comprise a material portion of our revenue. Our work on large government programs presents a risk to revenue growth and sustainability and profit margins.\nThe eventual expiration of large government programs or the loss of or disruption of revenues on a single contract may reduce our revenues and profits. Such revenue losses could also erode profits on our remaining programs that would have to absorb a larger portion of the fixed corporate costs previously allocated to the expiring programs or discontinued contract work. Our USPS managed inventory program and our FMS Program each constitute a material portion of our revenues and profits. This concentration of our revenue subjects us to the risk of material adverse revenue disruptions if customer operational decisions, government contractual or other issues prevent or delay the fulfillment of work requirements associated with these key programs. In recent years, revenue levels for our FMS Program have fluctuated widely enough to cause material changes in our overall revenue levels and affect our profit margins. Similarly, variations in volume and types of parts purchased by the USPS in recent years have caused changes in our profit margins.\nThe USPS has initiated a fleet replacement program for a next generation of the delivery vehicle fleet. The timing of both the roll out of a new fleet and the retirement of the current vehicles and their decision on how many of such vehicles will remain in the fleet could potentially have a significant impact on our future revenues and profits.\nAcquisitions, which have been a part of our business strategy in recent years, present certain risks.\nA key element of our business strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies. VSE is focused on acquiring complementary assets that add new products, new customers, and new capabilities or new geographic and/or operational competitive advantages in both new and existing markets within our core competencies. Our acquisition strategy is affected by, and poses a number of challenges and risks, including availability of suitable acquisition candidates, availability of capital, diversion of management\u2019s attention, effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies, potential write downs of acquired intangible assets, potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, use of a significant portion of our available cash, compliance with debt covenants and consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in future business conditions could cause business investments, recorded goodwill, and/or purchased intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nAs part of our business strategy, we acquire non-controlling and controlling interests in businesses. We make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. Business acquisitions involve estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine acquisition prices, which are allocated among acquired assets, including goodwill, based upon fair market values. Notwithstanding our analyses, due diligence processes, and business integration efforts, actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates. In such events, we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill and/or purchased intangible assets. In addition, declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill and/or purchased intangible asset impairment charges associated with our existing businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 31% and 13%, respectively, of our total assets. We evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgments. As a general matter, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets.\nAdverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock, or other events, such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or the operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based, could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIntense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business.\nThe aviation and vehicle parts industries are highly fragmented, have several highly visible leading companies, and are characterized by intense competition. Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than VSE or our subsidiaries, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that we do not have. In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.\nPressure on government budgets may adversely affect the flow of work to federal contractors, particularly new programs. Competitor contractors that experience a loss of government work have tended to redirect their marketing efforts toward the types of work that we perform. This increase in competition for our service offerings may adversely affect our ability to win new work or successor contracts to continue work that is currently performed by us under expiring contracts. Unsuccessful bidders frequently protest contract awards, which can delay or reverse the contract awards. Additionally, the government has frequently used contract award criteria that emphasizes lowest price, technically acceptable bids, which further intensifies competition in our government markets.\nOur success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation aftermarket, which could be impacted by lower demand for business aviation and commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.\nGeneral global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry may also affect our business. We are subject to macroeconomic cycles, and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers. Further, the aviation industry has historically, from time to time, been subject to downward cycles which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk. Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors. These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel disruption has had an adverse impact on airline spending and demand that has caused a reduction in demand for our aviation products and services for most of 2020. At this point, the extent or duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our future results remains uncertain.\nGlobal economic conditions and political factors could adversely affect our revenues.\nRevenues for work performed in or products delivered to foreign countries are subject to economic conditions in these countries and to political risks posed by ongoing foreign conflicts and potential terrorist activity. Significant domestic and political unrest in client countries can constrain our ability to maintain consistent staffing levels, resulting in a fluctuating level of services performed by our employees. We cannot predict when these conditions will occur or the effect it will have on our revenues. Regime changes in these countries can result in government restrictions upon the continuation of ongoing work. Economic conditions in both the United States and foreign countries, and global prices and availability of oil and other commodities could potentially have an adverse effect on the demand for some of our services, including our aviation services.\nThe nature of our operations and work performed by our employees present certain challenges related to work force management.\nOur financial performance is heavily dependent on the abilities of our operating and administrative staff with respect to technical skills, operating performance, pricing, cost management, safety, and administrative and compliance efforts. A wide diversity of contract types, nature of work, work locations, and legal and regulatory complexities challenges our administrative staff and skill sets. We also face challenges associated with our quality of workforce, quality of work, safety, and labor relations compliance. Our current and projected work in foreign countries exposes us to challenges associated with export and ethics compliance, local laws and customs, workforce issues, extended supply chain, political unrest and war zone threats. Failure to attract or retain an adequately skilled workforce, lack of knowledge or training in critical functions, or inadequate staffing levels can result in lost work, reduced profit margins, losses from cost overruns, performance deficiencies, workplace accidents, and regulatory noncompliance.\nOur business could be adversely affected by incidents that could cause an interruption in our operations or impose a significant financial liability on us.\nDisruption of our operations due to internal or external system or service failures, accidents or incidents involving employees or third parties working in high-risk locations, or natural disasters, health crisis, epidemics or pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other crises could adversely affect our financial performance and condition. The COVID-19 pandemic could potentially impact our global supply chain network for any of our segments. A fire, flood, earthquake, or other natural disaster, health crises, epidemic, pandemic or other crisis at or affecting physical facilities that support key revenue generating operations, or a procurement system or contractual delay could potentially interrupt the revenues from our operations.\nInvestments in inventory and facilities could cause losses if certain work is disrupted or discontinued.\nWe have made investments in inventory, facilities and lease commitments to support specific business programs, work requirements, and service offerings. A slowing or disruption of these business programs, work requirements, or service offerings that results in operating below intended levels could cause us to suffer financial losses.\nWe are dependent on access to and the performance of third-party package delivery companies.\nOur ability to provide efficient distribution of the products we sell to our customers is an integral component of our overall business strategy, both domestic and international. We do not maintain our own delivery networks, and instead rely on third-party package delivery companies. We cannot assure that we will always be able to ensure access to preferred shipping and delivery companies or that these companies will continue to meet our needs or provide reasonable pricing terms. In addition, if the package delivery companies on which we rely on experience delays resulting from inclement weather or other disruptions, we may be unable to maintain products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertain government budgets and shifting government priorities could delay contract awards and funding and adversely affect our ability to continue work under our government contracts. Additionally, federal procurement directives could result in our loss of work on current programs to small business set-asides and large multiple award contracts.\nOur government business is subject to funding delays, terminations (including at the government's convenience), reductions, in-sourcing, extensions and moratoriums associated with the government\u2019s budgeting and contracting process. The federal procurement environment is unpredictable and could adversely affect our ability to perform work under new and existing contracts. We have experienced delays in contract awards and funding on our contracts in recent years that have adversely affected our ability to continue existing work and to replace expiring work. Additionally, our government business is subject to the risk that one or more of our potential contracts or contract extensions may be diverted by the contracting agency to a small or disadvantaged or minority-owned business pursuant to set-aside programs administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or may be bundled into large multiple award contracts for very large businesses. These risks can potentially have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profit margins.\nChanges to DoD business practices could have a material effect on DoD's procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards.\nThe defense industry has experienced, and we expect will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices resulting from greater DoD focus on affordability, efficiencies, business systems, recovery of costs, and a re-prioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending. The DoD continues to adjust its procurement practices, requirements criteria, and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs, gain efficiencies, and enhance program management and control. We expect the DoD's focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the DoD's initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the DoD. Depending on how these initiatives are implemented, they could have an impact on our current programs, as well as new business opportunities with the DoD. As a result of certain of these initiatives, we experienced, and may continue to experience, a higher number of audits and/or lengthened periods of time required to close open audits. Such additional or lengthier audits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur business could be adversely affected by government audits or investigations.\nGovernment agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded.\nThe scope and rigor of government agency audits and investigations have increased in recent years, resulting in a greater likelihood that an audit or investigation may result in an adverse outcome. We have been subject to unfavorable findings and recommendations from various government agencies from time to time. We expect that government agencies will continue to rigorously audit and investigate us and there may be adverse or disputed findings, resulting in corrective action plans and/or settlements.\nIf an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the government. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if\nallegations of impropriety were made. Performance of international work can expose us to risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Export Control Act compliance.\nWe are subject to numerous government rules and regulations that could expose us to potential liabilities or work loss.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. A violation of laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of contracts or debarment from working or bidding on government contracts.\nIn some instances, these government contract laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are significantly more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the government may terminate any government contract or subcontract at its convenience, as well as for performance default.\nA termination for default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. A termination for default could also impact our past performance and ability to obtain new or additional work. In addition, the government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of services provided by us as a subcontractor.\nAdditionally, our contract work that is performed by our subcontractors is subject to government compliance, performance requirements and financial risks. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized.\nThe aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA and similar regulatory agencies in other countries. Aviation engines, engine accessories and components that we sell must meet certain airworthiness standards established by the FAA or the equivalent agencies in certain other countries. We also operate repair facilities that are licensed by the FAA and equivalent agencies of certain other countries to perform such services. New and more stringent regulations may be adopted in the future that could have an adverse effect on us.\nLastly, border tariffs and new trade deals could have significant effects on our customers and, in turn, on our suppliers, which may impact our business.\nDue to the nature of our work, we could potentially be exposed to legal actions arising from our operations.\nOur work includes many manual tasks, including warehousing, shipping and packing of truck parts inventory, maintaining and repairing military and non-military vehicles, aircraft and equipment, and maintaining and overhauling U.S. Navy ships. Some of our work efforts involve the handling of hazardous materials. These services may pose certain challenges that could cause us to be exposed to legal and other liabilities arising from performance issues, work related incidents or employee misconduct that result in damages, injury or death to third parties. Such events could cause us to suffer financial losses and adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\u201d below.\nEnvironmental and pollution risks could potentially impact our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. We expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations, and such costs could be substantial, depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions.\nSome of our contract work includes the use of chemical solvents and the handling of hazardous materials to maintain, repair, and refurbish vehicles, aircraft engines, and equipment. This exposes us to certain environmental and pollution risks. Various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation, storage, and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. Substantial fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several \"strict liability\" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties.\nCosts associated with compliance with Federal, State and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment have not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. However, we cannot predict the likelihood of such a material adverse effect should we experience the occurrence of a future environmental or pollution event.\nThe adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts, or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTechnology Risks\nTechnology security and cyber-attack risks could potentially impact our financial results.\nWe face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to our and our clients' proprietary or classified information.\nSome of our contract work includes data management and technology services associated with Social Security Administration and military medical and health records. This exposes us to certain information and technology security risks. If there is a security breach of sensitive data in our custody or for which we provide services, we could possibly be held liable for damages to third parties related to such security breach and incur costs to prevent future incidents. We also provide refurbishment, maintenance and training services support to international clients directly and through the DoD. Foreign nations with interests that conflict with the international clients we support could be motivated to conduct a cyber-attack to access information on these programs.\nWe maintain a cybersecurity risk management program to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity threats and an incident response plan for emerging threats. Costs associated with preventing or remediating information management security breaches or complying with related laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additionally, we have obtained insurance that provides coverage for certain cybersecurity incidents. However, the occurrence of a future security breach event could potentially have such an adverse effect.\nFinancial Risks\nThere can be no assurance we will continue to pay dividends at current levels or in the future.\nThe payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and our bank loan agreement, and to the discretion of our board of directors, considered in the context of then current conditions, including our earnings, other operating results, and capital requirements. Declines in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce stockholders\u2019 equity. A deficit in stockholders\u2019 equity could limit our ability under Delaware law to pay dividends.\nOur debt exposes us to certain risks.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $251 million of total debt outstanding (net of unamortized debt issuance costs). The amount of our existing debt, combined with our ability to incur significant amounts of debt in the future, could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022Increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022Exposing us to the risk of higher interest rates on borrowings under our Credit Facility, which are subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\nIn addition, the interest rate on our term loan borrowings and revolving loan borrowings is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. The consequences of the discontinuance of the LIBOR benchmark cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nMarket volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors.\nThe financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers. We may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities, including funding acquisitions and refinancing existing indebtedness. We may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our letters of credit. A number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, meet contractual commitments, make future investments or desirable acquisitions, or respond to competitive challenges.\nIf the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic continue to adversely impact our operations and financial performance, we may face further challenges regarding compliance with the financial covenants in our debt facility.\nWe have a loan agreement with a bank group comprised of ten banks. Under the terms of our debt facility, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants. As a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our business operations have been and could be further disrupted, which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our financial covenant requirements. In June 2020, we amended our loan agreement to provide increased financial covenant flexibility. We believe the amendment will provide sufficient covenant relief for future near term compliance, however, there can be no assurance that any further future disruption will not adversely impact our business and result in an inability to comply with the financial covenants in our loan agreement. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain future changes in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we were not able to satisfactorily obtain further changes to the debt facility, we could be in default, which could trigger an acceleration of repayment provisions that we would be unable to meet and would impair our ability to operate our businesses. If we make changes, it may lead to fees, increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable to us under the debt facility.", "PERMNO": 79864, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "VSEC"}
