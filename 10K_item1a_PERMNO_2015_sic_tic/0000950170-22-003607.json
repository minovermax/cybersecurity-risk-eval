{"cik": "25475", "company": "CRAWFORD & CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\tRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC from time to time when evaluating our business and prospects. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur, and our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nMARKET CONDITIONS\nWe depend on claim volumes for a significant portion of our revenues. Claim volumes are not subject to accurate forecasting, and a decline in claim volumes may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we depend on claim volume for revenue streams, a reduction in claim referrals for any reason may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict claim volumes for several reasons, including the following:\n\u2022changes in the degree to which property and casualty insurance carriers or self-insured entities outsource, or intend to outsource, their claims handling functions are generally not disclosed in advance;\n\u2022we cannot predict the length or timing of any insurance cycle;\n\u2022changes in the overall employment levels and associated workplace injury rates could impact the number of total claims and our claim volumes and are not subject to accurate forecasting;\n\u2022the frequency and severity of weather-related, natural, and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of claims for us, are also generally not subject to accurate forecasting;\n\u2022potential consolidation of clients in the markets we operate could impact the volume of claims referred to us;\n\u2022major insurance carriers, underwriters, and brokers could elect to expand their activities as administrators and adjusters, which would directly compete with our business; and\n\u2022we may not desire to or be able to renew existing major contracts with clients.\nIf our claim volume referrals decline for any of the foregoing, or any other reason, our revenues may decline, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.\nThe global spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results continues to depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n\u2022the duration and scope of the pandemic;\n\u2022governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic;\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response;\n\u2022the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions, both during and after the pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including as a result of travel restrictions and employees working from home;\n\u2022the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions;\n\u2022the impact on our third party vendors;\n\u2022any closures of our and our clients\u2019 offices and facilities;\n\u2022any restrictions on our ability to provide services at a claim site or the location of a claimant whether for purposes of evaluating the claim, managing the repair or delivering services, and\n\u2022how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nThe closure of offices or restrictions inhibiting our employees\u2019 ability to travel or interact with claimants and access claim sites, has disrupted, and could in the future disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, terminations of client contracts, delay in our ability to perform services, an altering of the mix of services requested by clients and claimants, and other losses of revenue. Clients may also slow down decision making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in this Annual Report and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent periods, we have derived a material amount of our revenues from a limited number of clients. If we are not able to retain these clients or replace these revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we derive a material portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. However, for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, three customers in our Crawford Platform Solutions segment each represented in excess of 10% of its revenue. For the year ended December 2019, our Crawford Platform Solutions segment derived in excess of 10% of its revenue from one customer.\nIn the event we are not able to retain these significant relationships, or replace any lost revenues from such relationships, revenues and operating earnings within this segment could be materially adversely affected.\nTECHNOLOGY AND DATA SECURITY\nWe manage a large amount of highly sensitive and confidential consumer information including personally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information. Unauthorized access to, alteration or disclosure of this data, whether as a result of criminal conduct, advances in computer hacking or otherwise, could result in a material loss of business, substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation.\nWe manage a large amount of highly sensitive and confidential consumer information including personally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information. A security or privacy incident impacting data processed or stored in our own facilities or data maintained, processed or stored by our service providers, including cloud service providers, could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of this information. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive and confidential information stored by us or our service providers may occur through break-ins, breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party, systems and technology failures, failed internet processes, theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of such sensitive and confidential information may be obtained through accidental or malicious failure to follow security policies or controls by us or our employees or our service providers. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of confidential consumer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the confidential information, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations, or fines. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.\nWe are subject to increased frequency and complexity of cybersecurity attacks. Our failure to effectively identify such attacks or quickly recover from such attacks could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMalicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, ransomware, worms and other destructive or disruptive software and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data, denial of service attacks and other malicious activities are becoming increasingly diverse and sophisticated and the incidence of these events is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education. Our business, which involves the collection, use, transmission and other processing of data, may make us and our clients and business partners attractive targets of hackers, denial of service attacks, malicious code, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, and other threat actors, including malicious insiders (such as employees and prior employees), which may result in security incidents, including the unauthorized access, misuse, loss, corruption, inaccessibility, or destruction of this data (including personal, confidential and sensitive data), unavailability of services, or other adverse events.\nWe have made investments in our information security policies, procedures and technical controls and routinely engage a third party to assess the maturity of our information security program against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. However, we may not be able to prevent a cybersecurity breach due to the increasing sophistication and frequency of such attacks. All employees receive security awareness training including communication of processes for reporting a potential security incident. We have a robust Cyber Incident Response Plan in place which provides a documented framework for handling high severity security and privacy incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts of the Company and with external expertise when necessary. Additionally, we have existing procedures to determine the potential materiality of a cybersecurity incident. These procedures include reporting protocols to and oversight from our Board of Directors. We also have disclosure controls and insider trading restrictions that would apply in the event of a material cybersecurity incident, and we routinely perform simulations and drills at both a technical and management level. Notwithstanding these measures, we cannot provide any assurance that we will always be able to prevent or mitigate a cybersecurity attack. These types of cybersecurity attacks and incidents can give rise to a variety of losses and costs, including legal exposure and regulatory fines, damages to reputation, and others.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.\nU.S. privacy and data security laws apply to our various businesses. We also do business globally in countries that have stringent data protection laws that may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. Globally, new and evolving laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in Europe and the U.K., the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") in California, and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to respond to customer requests under the laws, and to implement our business models effectively. These requirements, among others, may force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Any perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Additionally, we collect, process and store information at the direction of and on behalf of our customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.\nTransferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers are being updated following recent rulings by the Court of Justice for the European Union (\"CJEU\"). We are closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data outside the European Union (\"EU\"), including those which may be impacted by Brexit. These requirements may result in an increase in the obligations required to provide our services in the EU or in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other countries, including Brazil, China, Canada and Australia, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. These developments in Europe and elsewhere could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to develop or acquire necessary IT resources to support and grow our business, and disruptive technologies could impact the volume and pricing of our products. Our failure to address these risks could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have made substantial investments in software and related technologies that are critical to the core operations of our business. These IT resources will require future maintenance and enhancements, potentially at substantial costs. Additionally, these IT resources may become obsolete in the future and require replacement, potentially at substantial costs. We may not be able to develop, acquire replacement resources or identify new technology resources necessary to support and grow our business.\nIn addition, we could face changes in our markets due to disruptive technologies that could impact the volume and pricing of our products, or introduce changes to the insurance claims management processes which could negatively impact our volume of case referrals. Our failure to address these risks, or to do so in a timely manner or at a cost considered reasonable by us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we do not protect our proprietary information and technology resources and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our proprietary information, intellectual property, and technology, our financial results could be harmed.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, trade name, copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information, intellectual property, and technology. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. Third parties may copy aspects of our processes, products or materials, or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization. Unauthorized copying or use of our intellectual property or proprietary information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently, including by designing around any of our proprietary technology. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our intellectual property in those countries. Any legal action that we may bring to protect intellectual property and proprietary information could be unsuccessful, expensive and may distract management from day-to-day operations.\nWe currently operate on multiple proprietary and commercial software platforms to support our service offerings and internal corporate systems. The failure or obsolescence of any of these platforms, if not remediated or replaced, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe currently utilize multiple software platforms to support our service offerings. We believe certain of these software platforms distinguish our service offerings from our competitors. The failure of one or more of our software platforms to function properly, or the failure of these platforms to remain competitive, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the cost to replace such systems may not generate a commensurate benefit.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nA significant portion of our operations are international. These international operations subject us to political, legal, operational, exchange rate and other risks not generally present in U.S. operations, which could materially negatively affect those operations or our business.\nOur international operations subject us to political, legal, operational, financial, exchange rate and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations. Many of these operations are substantially smaller than our U.S. operations and as such are at risk of generating operating losses due to lack of scale. We face, among other risks, the risk of discriminatory regulation; nationalization or expropriation of assets; changes in both domestic and foreign laws regarding taxation, trade and investment abroad; pandemics such as coronavirus; potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights; or price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they were earned or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies.\nFor example, although we do not have direct exposure from the Russia/Ukraine conflict, we are aware of its potential negative impact to adjacent economies which could lower claim activity across our network of offices in Europe and increase our exposure to cyber attacks.\nInternational operations also subject us to numerous additional laws and regulations that are in addition to, or may be different from, those affecting U.S. businesses, such as those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, antitrust and competition, trade restriction, environmental protection, consumer protection, import/export and anti-corruption, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). Although we have put into place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors, and agents could inadvertently or intentionally take actions that violate any of these requirements. Violations of these regulations could impact our ability to conduct business, or subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe currently, and from time to time in the future may, outsource a portion of our internal business functions to third-party providers. Outsourcing these functions has significant risks, and our failure to manage these risks successfully could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe currently, and from time to time in the future may, outsource significant portions of our internal business functions to third-party providers. Third-party providers may not comply on a timely basis with all of our requirements, or may not provide us with an acceptable level of service. In addition, our reliance on third-party providers could have significant negative consequences, including significant disruptions in our operations and significantly increased costs to undertake our operations, either of which could damage our relationships with our customers. As a result of our outsourcing activities, it may also be more difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees for our business needs at any time. Our failure to successfully outsource any material portion of our business functions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNatural or manmade disasters or other acts of violence may affect the markets in which we operate, our clients and our service delivery.\nOur business may be negatively affected by instability, disruption or destruction in the many geographic regions where we operate. Natural or manmade disasters, including storm, flood, fire, earthquake, pandemics and other regional or global health crises, as well as war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, may cause damage to our facilities or disrupt our services. This includes our shared services centers which exist in international geographies. Specifically, we continue to increase employees and processes performed by our Global Business Service Center located in the Philippines. Our crisis management procedures, business continuity plans and disaster recovery capabilities may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disasters, particularly in the case of a catastrophic event. These events may pose significant security risks to our employees, the facilities where they work, our operations, electricity and other utilities, communications, travel and network services and the disruption of any or all of them could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are, and may become, party to lawsuits or other claims or investigations that could adversely impact our business.\nIn the normal course of the claims administration services business, we are from time to time named as a defendant in suits by insureds or claimants contesting decisions by us or our clients with respect to the settlement of claims. Additionally, our clients have in the past brought, and may, in the future bring, claims for indemnification on the basis of alleged actions on our part or on the part of our agents or our employees in rendering services to clients. There can be no assurance that additional lawsuits will not be filed against us. There also can be no assurance that any such lawsuits will not have a disruptive impact upon the operation of our business, that the defense of the lawsuits will not consume the time and attention of our senior management and financial resources or that the resolution of any such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign labor, employment, worker health and safety, antitrust and competition, environmental and consumer protection, import/export, anti-corruption, and other laws. From time to time, we face claims and investigations by employees, former employees, and governmental entities under such laws or employment contracts with such employees or former employees. Such claims, investigations, and any litigation involving the Company could divert management's time and attention from business operations and could potentially result in substantial costs of defense, settlement or other disposition, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe costs of compliance with sustainability or other environmental, social responsibility or governance laws, regulations, or policies, including investor and client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business.\nAs a non-manufacturing service business, we have to date been less impacted from laws and regulations related to sustainability concerns or other environmental, social responsibility or governance laws, regulations, or policies. However, we could incur ESG-related costs indirectly through our customers or shareholders. Increasingly our customers and shareholders expect that we meet social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. Our compliance with these policies and related requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL\nOur U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the \"U.S. Qualified Plan\") is underfunded. Future funding requirements, including those imposed by any further regulatory changes, could restrict cash available for our operating, financing, and investing requirements.\nAt the end of the most recent measurement periods for our U.S. Qualified Plan, the projected benefit obligation was underfunded by $15.2 million. In recent years we have made voluntary contributions to this plan, but we do not expect to make any discretionary contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan in the next fiscal year. Volatility in the capital markets, mortality changes and future legislation may have a negative impact on our pension plans, which may further increase the underfunded portion and our attendant funding obligations. Any future contributions to our underfunded defined benefit pension plan could reduce our liquidity, restrict available cash for our operating, financing, and investing needs and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to deploy capital to other opportunities. Any decision to terminate the plan and settle the defined-benefit pension obligation would result in a non-cash charge within the consolidated statements of operations related to unrecognized actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income, which totals $190.9 million as of December 31, 2021.\nWhile we do not anticipate any contribution in 2022, we intend to comply with any future funding requirements through the use of cash from operations. However, there can be no assurance that we will generate enough cash to do so. Our inability to fund these obligations through cash from operations could require us to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings under our Credit Facility (defined below), if available, proceeds from debt or equity financings, or asset sales. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such external funding in amounts, at times and on terms that we deem commercially reasonable, in order for us to meet these obligations. Furthermore, any of the foregoing could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements, or dilute the value of the holdings of our current shareholders, as the case may be. Our inability to comply with any funding obligations in a timely manner could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have debt covenants in our credit facility that require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios and other requirements. If we are not able to maintain compliance with these requirements, all of our outstanding debt could become immediately due and payable.\nWe are party to a credit facility, effective as of November 5, 2021, with Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Truist Bank, and the other lenders a party thereto, (the \"Credit Facility\"). The Credit Facility consists of a $450 million revolving credit facility, with a letter of credit subcommitment of $125 million. The available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $260.2 million on December 31, 2021. The Credit Facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting liens, indebtedness, guarantees, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, restrictions on dividends and distributions, and other fundamental changes in our business. Additionally, the Credit Facility contains covenants requiring us to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.\nIf we do not maintain compliance with the covenant requirements, we may be in default under the Credit Facility. In such an event, the lenders under the Credit Facility would generally have the right to declare all then-outstanding amounts thereunder immediately due and payable. If we could not obtain a required waiver on satisfactory terms, we could be required to renegotiate the terms of the Credit Facility or immediately repay this indebtedness. Any such renegotiation could result in less favorable terms, including additional fees, higher interest rates and accelerated payments, and would necessitate significant time and attention of management, which could divert their focus from business operations. Any required payment may necessitate the sale of assets or other uses of resources that we do not believe would be in our best interests. While we do not presently expect to be in violation of any of these requirements, no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to comply with them in the future. Any failure to continue to comply with such requirements could materially adversely affect our borrowing ability and access to liquidity, and thus our overall financial condition, as well as our ability to operate our business. We do not believe there is significant risk to our debt covenants when LIBOR is replaced with an alternative reference rate in the future. We have no current hedged transactions, and our Credit Facility establishes a rate replacement mechanism when LIBOR is no longer quoted.\nIn recent periods we have incurred impairment charges that reduced the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill; in the future we may be required to incur additional impairment charges on a portion of or all of the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEach year, and more frequently on an interim basis if appropriate, we are required by ASC Topic 350, \"Intangibles--Goodwill and Other,\" to assess the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether the carrying value of those assets is impaired. Such assessment and determination involves significant judgments to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including estimating future cash flows, near term and long term revenue growth, and determining appropriate discount rates, among other assumptions. We intend to continue to monitor the performance of our reporting units and, should actual operating earnings consistently fall below forecasted operating earnings, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. Any such charges could materially adversely affect our financial results in the periods in which they are recorded.\nControl by a principal shareholder could adversely affect the Company and our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Jesse C. Crawford, a member of our Board of Directors, and the father of Jesse C. Crawford, Jr., who is also a member of the Board of Directors, beneficially owned approximately 62% of our outstanding voting Class B Common Stock. As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors. He also has the ability to control our management and affairs. As of December 31, 2021, Mr. Crawford also beneficially owned approximately 35% of our outstanding non-voting Class A Common Stock. This concentration of ownership of our stock may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; reduce the liquidity, and thus the trading price, of our stock; or result in other actions that may be opposed by, or not be in the best interests of, the Company and our other shareholders.\nCOMPETITION AND EMPLOYEES\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face intense competition from both established entities and new entrants into those markets. Potential consolidation in our industry can also create stronger competition. Our failure to compete effectively may adversely affect us.\nOur ability to retain clients and maintain and increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.\nThe global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies that vary in size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. We are also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters.\nWe also face competition from potential new entrants into the global claims management services market, in addition to traditional competitors. Potential consolidation in our industry can also create stronger competition. Our inability to react to such competition could negatively impact our volume of case referrals and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel, including retaining enough qualified and experienced on-call claims adjusters, to respond to catastrophic events that may, singularly or in combination, significantly increase our clients' needs for claims adjusters.\nOur catastrophe-related work and revenues can fluctuate dramatically based on the frequency and severity of natural and man-made disasters. When such events happen, our clients usually require a sudden and substantial increase in the need for catastrophic claims services, which can strain our capacity. Our internal resources are sometimes not sufficient to meet these sudden and substantial increases in demand. When these situations occur, we must retain outside adjusters (temporary employees and contractors) to increase our capacity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain such outside adjusters with the requisite qualifications, at the times needed or on terms that we believe are economically reasonable. Insurance companies and other loss adjusting firms also aggressively compete for the same pool of outside adjusters, who often command high prices for their services at such times of peak demand. Such competition could reduce availability, increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Our failure to timely, efficiently, and competently provide these services to our clients could result in reduced revenues, loss of customer goodwill and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe compete for nurses and other case management professionals in the healthcare industry, which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nOur Crawford TPA Solutions business competes with the general healthcare industry in recruiting qualified nurses, other case management professionals and other talent. In some markets, the scarcity of nurses and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. Such competition could reduce availability, increase our costs and reduce our revenues. This shortage may require us to increase wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses, and other healthcare professionals, or to control labor costs could result in reduced revenues, loss of customer goodwill and a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe face challenges caused by our aging workforce and we may not be able to recruit, train, and retain adequate replacements for our qualified and skilled employees.\nMany of the nurses and adjusters in our industry, including those that we employ directly, are approaching retirement age. As these experienced employees retire, we may have difficulty recruiting new employees with comparable qualifications and experience, and we may be unable to transfer our employees\u2019 institutional knowledge successfully to new qualified employees. Any such failures would be exacerbated at times of peak demand and could cause us to rely more heavily on outside nurses and adjusters. Our failure to recruit and train new employees and to ensure they obtain the adequate qualifications and experience could result in reduced revenues, loss of customer goodwill and a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to inflation risks which could increase our wages, benefits, and other costs which may result in decreased profitability.\nWe are impacted by inflationary increases in wages, benefits and other costs. In all countries in which we operate, wage and benefit inflation, whether driven by competition for talent, or ordinary course pay increases and other inflationary pressure, may increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability. Furthermore, as a result of our global operations, wage increases in emerging markets may increase at a faster rate than wages in the U.S. and other developed markets, which increases our exposure to inflation risks. If we are not able to pass increased wage and other costs resulting from inflation onto our clients or charge premium prices when justified by market demand, our profitability may decline.\nThe risks described above are not the only ones we face, but are the ones currently deemed the most material by us based on available information. New risks may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of known risks on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.", "PERMNO": 76274, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "CRD.A"}
