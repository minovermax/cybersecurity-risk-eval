Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe markets for our services are intensely competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors.\nThe markets for our services are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. For information regarding the markets in which we compete, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition.\u201d Competition in the market for collaboration software and services continues to increase as new providers enter the marketplace and offer a broader range of collaboration solutions through new technologies. Many of our current and potential competitors, such as major telecommunications, business suite software, unified communications, application service and web conferencing providers, webcasting team workspace and desktop video conferencing providers, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, more robust service offerings, more comprehensive support organizations, larger customer bases and substantially greater financial, personnel, marketing, engineering, technical and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands. They may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. We believe that our current competitors are likely to expand their service offerings, and new competitors are likely to continue to emerge. Some of our existing and potential competitors may enter into or expand their positions in the markets in which we compete through mergers, acquisitions or strategic divestitures, strategic alliances and the development of integrated service offerings, such as NTT\u2019s acquisition of a majority interest in Arkadin and West Corporation's recent divestiture of its agent services business. Also, the composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key growth areas. We compete with companies with whom we also have reseller and distribution arrangements, as well as with internally developed solutions for companies who choose to insource these needs. As we expand our current market opportunity, we also face pressures from free conferencing providers, and smaller and niche conferencing providers, as well as consumer-oriented technology providers that are attempting to enter the enterprise collaboration market and CRM and social business platform providers, which are integrating real-time collaboration services into their offerings. In a number of international markets, we face substantial competition from local service providers, which may have a dominant market share in their territories or are owned by local telecommunication service providers. In addition, the composition of our competitors may change as we continue to expand our suite of collaboration solutions, including through acquisitions. Increased competition could result in pricing pressure on our services and a decrease in our market share in the various markets in which we compete, either of which could hinder our ability to grow our revenue.\nTechnological change and the development of alternatives to our services may cause us to lose market share and may hinder our ability to maintain or grow our revenue.\nThe market for our services is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. We expect new services and enhancements to existing services to be developed and introduced by existing companies and new entrants that will compete with our services. Technological advances may result in the development and commercial availability of alternatives to, or new methods of, delivering our services and pricing options that could be more attractive to our customers. These developments could cause our existing services to become obsolete, result in significant pricing pressure on our services or allow our existing and potential customers to meet their own business communications needs without using our services.\nWe must continually introduce new services and enhancements to existing services in response to technological changes, evolving industry standards and customer demands. Our ability to successfully develop and market such new services and enhancements depends, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022\nforesee changes in industry standards and customer needs;\n\u2022\nanticipate and apply advances in technologies;\n\u2022\nenhance our software, applications, equipment, systems and networks; and\n\u2022\nattract and retain qualified and creative technical personnel.\nIf we do not meet these challenges, we may lose market share and our ability to maintain and grow our revenue. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty integrating new technologies into our existing services and systems. The number of people using devices other than landline telephones and personal computers to access collaboration services has increased dramatically in the past few years. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict problems we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for these alternative devices. For example, our multi-platform presence currently includes access via market-leading web browsers, as well as apps for desktops, tablets and smartphones. If we cannot successfully integrate new technologies, or fail to capture a significant share of this increasingly important portion of the market, we may not generate sufficient revenue and operational synergies may not develop.\nOur future success depends on market acceptance of our SaaS solutions.\nMarket acceptance of our SaaS solutions often requires that individuals and enterprises accept new ways of communicating and exchanging information. Our growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new services and enhancements to our existing services. For example, we believe that the success of our SaaS solutions will depend on customer perceptions as to the technological and operational benefits or improved user experience associated with these services as compared to alternative services. A failure of our products to achieve broad market acceptance or a decline in the demand for our services could hinder our ability to maintain and increase our revenue. We believe that broad market acceptance of our collaboration solutions will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nease of use;\n\u2022\nprice;\n\u2022\nreliability;\n\u2022\naccessibility to our services;\n\u2022\nquality of service;\n\u2022\nsystem security and trustworthiness;\n\u2022\nproduct functionality; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our strategic marketing and sales efforts and distribution channels.\nIf we do not meet these challenges, our SaaS solutions may not achieve broad market acceptance or market acceptance may not occur quickly enough to justify our investment in these services. In addition, our services and enhancements may not be as successful as our competitors\u2019 solutions. Furthermore, if we are unable to develop new services and enhancements or if we experience delays or problems with their introduction, we may not be able to gain market share and increase our revenue.\nWe believe that continuing to strengthen our current services and brand and effectively launching new services and enhancements to our existing services will require continued focus on active marketing efforts. In addition, we continue to add to our suite of collaboration solutions through acquisitions. In order for our collaboration software applications to succeed in the future, we believe we will need to market and sell to our existing customer base and focus on new market opportunities and shifting\nto entirely new user communities. For this shift outside the traditionally-defined collaboration market to occur, our solutions must better meet a need than services currently offered in the market. The demand for and cost of advertising have been increasing and may continue to increase. Accordingly, we may need to spend increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users. Promotional efforts may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expense in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and expand the products and services we provide to existing customers.\nWe must retain and continue to expand our ability to reach and sell additional products and services to our customers by transitioning our customers from our more traditional audio-only conferencing services accessed via a telephone to our next-generation collaboration software applications accessed via devices, such as computers, tablets or smartphones. In addition, large global enterprise customers may request special customization, integration features or pricing, such as bundled pricing or volume discounts, which could negatively impact our revenue and margins and generally have longer sales cycles, making it difficult to predict when these sales will occur. Delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period.\nWe are subject to pricing pressures for our services which could cause a loss in market share and decreased revenue and profitability.\nWe compete for customers based on several factors, including price. If we cannot compete on price, we may lose market share. If we reduce our rates without increasing our volume or our market share, our revenue could decrease. For example, we have experienced declines in the average selling price per minute of our audio conferencing services and expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future. We also offer free trials of our SaaS solutions and introduced GlobalMeet at what we believe to be competitive pricing. In some cases, our competitors may offer their services for free, at reduced rates or on a trial basis in order to win customers. In addition, we compete with telecommunications service providers that generally have lower voice and data costs as a result of their ownership of an underlying telecommunications network and may offer services similar to ours at reduced rates. We believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace for our services. We have reduced our pricing to retain existing customers in certain circumstances and expect we may be required to further reduce our pricing in the future. If we are unable to offset any pricing declines through increased volumes or decreases in our costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur customer contracts typically do not contain revenue commitments and are not exclusive.\nMost of our customer contracts for audio conferencing do not contain revenue commitments, and we do not typically have long-term or exclusive contracts with our customers. Historically, our customer contracts for audio conferencing generally enable customers to terminate the contract or reduce volume without penalty and are often subject to renegotiation at any time. In addition, many of our larger enterprise customers allocate their business among multiple service providers with whom we must compete. For example, we previously disclosed that the partial loss of one of our larger enterprise audio conferencing customers negatively impacted our fourth quarter 2013 and 2014 financial results. Any of these developments could result in significant customer and associated revenue loss.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain strategic reseller and distribution relationships, our revenue may not grow or may decline.\nWe believe that our ability to increase the sales of our services depends in part upon maintaining and strengthening reseller and distribution relationships with our current strategic partners and any future strategic partners. We depend on strategic relationships with third-party resellers and distributors in order to reach a larger customer base than we can reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts, including in international markets. For example, we have announced strategic alliances with leading international telecommunications services, enterprise application software and technology distribution providers, including Deutsche Telekom, eircom, TeliaSonera, SAP, Ingram Micro Tech Data and Thinking Phone Networks, which will offer some or all of our collaboration solutions to their customers through resell opportunities or their online marketplaces. We can offer no assurances that any such existing or future strategic relationship will perform to our expectations or continue in the future. Because these relationships may involve revenue sharing, if our strategic relationships do not produce the revenue we anticipate, we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution, sales and marketing of our products and services, which would increase our costs. In addition, these relationships may not generate enough revenue to offset the resources used to develop the relationships. Some of these third parties offer products from several different companies, including products that compete with\nour products. In addition, some of these relationships are in the early stage, and we cannot control whether these third parties devote adequate resources to promote and sell our products. These relationships may also impede our ability to enter into other desirable strategic relationships.\nWe have also established reseller arrangements with a number of other companies pursuant to which we resell third-party web conferencing services, including with some of the companies listed in our \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d section of this annual report, which offer competing services to our collaboration solutions. These third parties may cease to offer some or all of their services or our services, pursue other relationships with our competitors, choose to increase their emphasis on their own offerings competitive to ours or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with us. In addition, these third-parties may choose to terminate their relationship with us as our reseller agreements generally allow termination without penalty. For example, we received a notice of termination for convenience from one of these companies in 2013. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to offset the loss of any revenue generated from any of these relationships upon their termination through growth in our collaboration solutions or the establishment of relationships with other resellers offering similar services.\nIn addition, many of our resellers and distributors have multiple strategic relationships and may not regard us as significant for their businesses. If we are unable to leverage the strength of our strategic reseller relationships to generate additional revenue, our revenue may not grow or may decline.\nGlobal economic or market conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business trends and revenue growth may be affected by negative changes in the global economic or market conditions, higher global unemployment or lower global business activity. Historically, challenging economic conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions have adversely affected our industry and our customers\u2019 level of spending, ability to make timely payments to us for our services and adoption of new technologies, which has required us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, negatively affected our days sales outstanding, led to increased price competition and adversely affected our results of operations.\nPrice increases from our telecommunications service providers or our inability to efficiently utilize or re-negotiate pricing or minimum purchase requirements in these agreements could decrease our profitability.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to obtain voice and data services on favorable terms from telecommunications service providers. The total amount of our minimum purchase requirements in 2014 was approximately $10.8 million, and we incurred telecommunications costs in excess of these minimums. Agreements with some of our telecommunications service providers contain minimum purchase requirements totaling approximately $6.2 million, $2.7 million and $0.7 million for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. In addition, certain circuits and colocation services that we purchase are subject to term requirements, including penalties for early termination. These service providers are not obligated to renew these agreements or offer the same or lower rates in the future, and these agreements may be subject to termination or modification for reasons outside of our control. Other telecommunications suppliers may provide similar services at lower prices, and we may not be able to re-negotiate our current supply agreements to achieve comparable lower rates. Such additional costs may require us to increase the prices for our services to our customers. We can give no assurance that we will be able to utilize the minimum amount of services that we are required to purchase under our telecommunications supply agreements or re-negotiate at competitive pricing without such minimums. If we are unable to obtain telecommunications services on favorable terms or if we are required to purchase more services than we are able to utilize in the operation of our business, the costs of providing our services would likely increase, which could decrease our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruption in third-party services that we use could result in service delays and disruptions, a loss of significant customers and revenue or an increase in costs.\nWe do not own a telecommunications network and host a significant portion of our operational and network systems through third parties. As a result, we depend on a variety of third-party providers for voice and data services, financial systems and Internet access. Our ability to maintain and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunications, financial systems hosting services and web-based services on favorable terms from traditional and VoIP telecommunications service providers, local exchange carriers, financial system providers, computer hosting providers and Internet service providers. We have experienced delays and disruptions in our services in the past due to service interruptions from telecommunications service providers. For example, in Fall 2013, we experienced a service interruption as a result of one of our\nprimary underlying carrier's network outage, which necessitated that we transition our traffic to more expensive back-up networks. In addition, we have experienced service interruptions as a result of our expanded international coverage access points and increased traffic volumes. Any interruptions in the delivery of our services due to third-party outages could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or harm our reputation, which would make attracting new customers more difficult. In addition, because many of our services are critical to our customers, any significant interruption in service could result in losses to customers. Although our customer contracts generally limit our liability for service failures and exclude liability for consequential damages, a court might not enforce these provisions, which could expose us to financial loss. Further, we often provide our customers with service level commitments, which if not met, may obligate us to provide service credits or other compensation to our customers or allow customers to terminate or renegotiate their contracts, which could negatively affect our results.\nDowntime in our network infrastructure could result in the loss of significant customers and revenue.\nWe currently maintain facilities with network infrastructure and telecommunications equipment in locations throughout the world. The delivery of our services is dependent, in part, upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our facilities against damage that may be caused by fire, power loss, technical failures, unauthorized intrusion, natural disasters, sabotage and other similar events. Despite taking a variety of precautions, we have experienced downtime in our networks from time to time, and we may experience downtime in the future. While our global expansion provides us with greater geographic diversity, it also can increase the complexity of managing and configuring our network. Although we believe that we take substantial precautions to protect ourselves and our customers from events that could interrupt delivery of our services, service interruptions could still occur and result in the loss of significant customers, which could cause us to lose revenue. While we maintain business interruption insurance, it may not cover all outages and we may not be able to maintain insurance for this risk in the future, or it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices. Even if we maintain insurance for this risk, it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers.\nDisruption to our customers\u2019 businesses may negatively impact our business and financial results.\nDisruption to our customers\u2019 businesses may affect our revenue. The number of business days within a financial reporting period affects our business and results of operations. Natural disasters and other catastrophic events could impact the business activity of our customers and lead to lower revenue than we anticipate. If a natural disaster or other major event significantly disrupts our customers\u2019 businesses, even if our infrastructure is unaffected, it could impact our revenue.\nIf we fail to increase our network capacity to meet customer demands, the quality of our service offerings may suffer.\nWe continuously attempt to predict growth in our network usage and add capacity accordingly. If we do not accurately predict and efficiently manage growth in our network usage, the quality of our service offerings may suffer, and we may lose customers.\nTechnological obsolescence of our equipment or systems could result in substantial capital expenditures.\nTechnological advances may result in the development of new or changing industry standards, which could cause our equipment or systems to become obsolete. These events could require us to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing our equipment. In addition, new standards could be introduced in the future that may require us to upgrade our media servers in certain regions around the world to enable us to more effectively meet our requirements and grow our business.\nSecurity and privacy breaches of the security measures we employ to protect our customers\u2019 confidential information may have an adverse impact on the use of our services.\nDespite the security measures we have taken to protect our customers\u2019 confidential information, such as customers\u2019 business, credit card or other personally identifiable information, transmitted over the Internet and public networks, our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, viruses or similar problems. If someone is able to circumvent our security measures, they could misappropriate our customers\u2019 or our proprietary information or cause an interruption in our operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nActual or perceived security breaches, whether from human error or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or accidental technical failure, could damage our reputation, expose us to a risk of loss or liability and result in a loss of\nconfidence in the security of our services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. For example, our customers may be targeted by parties using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201cTrojan horse\u201d programs to our customers\u2019 computers. We may be required to make additional significant investments in efforts to protect against and remedy these and other types of security breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate. In addition, some of our customers are subject to varying degrees of government regulation, particularly in the insurance, healthcare and financial services industries. Increased regulation of data privacy protections and information security obligations could impose additional regulatory pressures on our and our customers\u2019 businesses and indirectly, on our operations. Some of our customers have sought, and may continue to seek, to contractually impose certain data privacy and information security obligations on us and some of our customer contracts may not contractually limit our liability for the loss of confidential information. If we are unable to adequately address these concerns, our business and results of operations could suffer. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations, where required or undertaken by us, may result in cost increases due to various factors, including potential systems changes, the development of additional administrative processes and increased enforcement actions and fines and penalties. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply or any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of covered information, such as sensitive or confidential information, may result in proceedings or actions against us by government or other entities, private lawsuits against us such as class actions or the loss of customers, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nUndetected errors or defects in our software could affect market acceptance of our services and harm our business.\nOur solutions are complex and may contain undetected errors, defects or bugs. We face additional technical challenges because our customers use our solutions across a variety of devices and platforms and may be integrated with products and platforms developed by third parties. We have from time to time found bugs in our solutions, which is most common when we first introduce a solution or when we release new versions or enhancements, and we may detect such errors in the future. Such errors or defects could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and delays in, loss of market acceptance of or customer satisfaction with our services, which could adversely affect our reputation, result in lost sales and harm our business and results of operations.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our platform.\nSome of our SaaS solutions contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under open source licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain provisions that require attribution or that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software used. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public at no cost. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in an adverse impact upon our intellectual property rights and ability to commercialize our products.\nThe terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we cannot assure that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses form third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our products, to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur SaaS Solutions present execution and competitive risks.\nOur SaaS solutions offered in the cloud and accessible via the web without hardware installation or software downloads present new and difficult technology challenges. These offerings depend on integration of third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors working together with our products. We also expect other companies to enter into the emerging cloud computing market and to introduce their own initiatives that may compete with, or not be compatible with, our cloud initiatives. Our SaaS solutions may not attract or generate sufficient usage or revenue to recoup our investments in them. If we are not successful in our transition to a higher weighting of our revenue from these solutions, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims by customers if they experience service disruptions, breaches or other quality issues related to our cloud-based solutions.\nOur financial performance could cause future write-downs of goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $386.4 million of goodwill not subject to amortization and $102.4 million of other intangible assets, net of amortization, of which $100.9 million is subject to continuing amortization reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an annual impairment review. We are required to exercise significant judgment in identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition and general economic conditions. Any change in our key assumptions could result in an impairment charge that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nSome of our solutions may be subject to telecommunications excise tax and sales taxes in states and local jurisdictions where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively, $0.1 million and $0.9 million of payments of tax and interest related to the settlement of these state excise and sales tax contingencies were made. We have reserves for certain state excise and sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in \u201cAccrued taxes, other than income taxes\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had reserved $9.9 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for certain state excise and sales tax contingencies and interest. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, states may disagree with our method of assessing and remitting such taxes or additional states may subject us to inquiries regarding such taxes. For example, as discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, we received notices of deficiencies from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in March 2013 relating to telecommunications franchise and gross excise taxes assessed on our former subsidiary, Xpedite Systems, LLC, or Xpedite, for which we have agreed to indemnify EasyLink Services International Corporation, or EasyLink (subsequently acquired by Open Text Corporation, or OpenText), in connection with our PGiSend sale.\nWe generate a significant amount of revenue from outside the United States and any repatriation of funds from our foreign subsidiaries may result in higher effective tax rates. In addition, proposed changes to U.S. tax laws could significantly affect how we are taxed on foreign earnings. If passed, such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense.\nWe may not realize the anticipated savings from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives.\nTo allow us to operate more efficiently and control costs, we have incurred restructuring charges related to the consolidation and streamlining of various functions of our workforce. We incurred severance costs, lease termination costs and exit costs of approximately $0.7 million in 2014 as part of our restructuring efforts, and we anticipate incurring additional restructuring costs during the first quarter of 2015 as we continue to work to optimize and align our organizational and cost structures globally. We may not realize the expected benefits of these initiatives and may incur additional restructuring costs in the future. In addition, we could experience delays, business disruptions, unanticipated employee turnover and increased litigation-related costs in connection with our restructuring efforts. The complex nature of these restructuring initiatives could cause difficulties or delays in the implementation of any such initiative or the impact of the restructuring initiatives may not be immediately apparent. We can offer no assurance that our estimates of the savings achievable by these initiatives will be realized, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe performance of our business depends on attracting, retaining and integrating qualified key personnel.\nOur performance depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate qualified key personnel, including highly skilled executive, sales, marketing personnel, customer support, product development and other technical personnel. In the software and services industry in particular, there is substantial and continuous competition for software engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software applications and web-based services. The employment of our key personnel in the United States is at will and not subject to employment agreements. Failure to attract, retain and integrate qualified key employees or delay in hiring could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our business, our ability to successfully sell existing services, develop new services and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Level of Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had utilized approximately $334.2 million of indebtedness, including approximately $330.9 million in borrowings and $3.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under our $575.0 million credit facility, which consists of a $350.0 million revolver, a $150.0 million Term A loan and a $75.0 million accordion feature. Although we do not have any outstanding interest rates swaps at December 31, 2014, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates on interest payments associated with our credit facility.\nOur level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nA portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of any interest or amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nIncreases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure; and\n\u2022\nDepending on the levels of our outstanding debt, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes may be limited.\nAt the scheduled maturity of our credit facility in August 2019 or in the event of an acceleration of the indebtedness under the facility following an event of default, the entire outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness under the facility, together with all other amounts payable thereunder from time to time, will become due and payable. It is possible that we may not have sufficient funds to pay such obligations in full at maturity or upon such acceleration. If we default and are not able to pay any such obligations due, our lenders have liens on substantially all of our assets and could foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our obligations.\nOur dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business and our ability to meet our debt service obligations.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay amounts due under our indebtedness in the future will be dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash distributions of earnings, loans or other payments to us or to ATS, the borrower under our credit facility, based on our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and cash flows. Our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds or may not be able to distribute sufficient funds to us, due to tax implications or other restrictions, to enable us to service or repay such indebtedness or meet our other obligations.\nIf our quarterly results do not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price may decrease.\nOur quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast because the market for our services is rapidly evolving and our services are primarily usage-based and event-driven, as the majority of our revenue is currently derived without subscription-based or license fees or minimum commitments. In addition, our introduction of new solutions and changes in our product and customer mix has affected our gross margins. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations as to future revenue. If our revenue levels are below expectations, we may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately, and our operating results would likely be adversely affected. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. It is possible that our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors in a future quarter, which will likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Specific factors that may cause our future operating results to vary include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in organic growth, SaaS revenue growth, operating expenses or gross margins;\n\u2022\nincreased competition and pricing pressure;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute on our operating plans and strategy, including our SaaS business model;\n\u2022\nvariations in our customer mix and mix of products sold;\n\u2022\ntiming of our revenue;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our collaboration solutions;\n\u2022\nthe reliability and performance of our services;\n\u2022\nrenewal rates;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new service announcements;\n\u2022\nour investment in sales, marketing and advertising initiatives to promote the awareness and adoption of our SaaS solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulations and legislation that may affect the competitive environment for our services;\n\u2022\nour ability to realize benefits from strategic alliances; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, market conditions related to our industry and seasonal factors.\nOur stock price has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, the intraday trading price of our common stock ranged from a high of $14.05 to a low of $9.89. The volatility of our stock price can be due to factors such as:\n\u2022\nfluctuating operating results and forward-looking guidance, related to organic growth, SaaS revenue, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, gross margin and other financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nour success in transitioning our business model and increasing sales of our SaaS solutions;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technological innovations, customer contracts, mergers or acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nannouncements of customer additions and customer losses;\n\u2022\nchanges in security analysts\u2019 estimates of our future financial performance, investment ratings or target prices;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of shares of common stock, debt or other convertible securities by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital raising transaction;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock prices of our peer companies or in the stock market in general;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Additionally, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock price of many technology companies in ways that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.\nOur articles and bylaws and Georgia corporate law may inhibit a takeover which may be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nThere are several provisions in our articles and bylaws and under Georgia corporate law that may inhibit a takeover, even when a takeover may be in the interests of our shareholders. For example, our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action. The existence of this \u201cblank-check\u201d preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. We are also subject to provisions of the Georgia corporate law that relate to business combinations with interested shareholders, which may inhibit a takeover. In addition to considering the effects of any action on us and our shareholders, our articles permit our board to consider the interests of various constituencies, including employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, communities in which we maintain offices or operations and other factors which it deems pertinent, in carrying out and discharging its duties and responsibilities and in determining what the board believes to be in our best interests.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions and Divestures\nWe face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions.\nOur growth has been enhanced through our acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that we believe will complement our business. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, frequently engage in acquisition discussions, conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions and, if appropriate, engage in acquisition negotiations. For example, since the second half of 2013, we have acquired six companies. We incur significant transaction costs associated with our acquisitions, including fees for attorneys, accountants and other advisors. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets or do so at attractive valuations. In addition, we compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources, and competition with these companies for acquisition targets could result in increased prices for possible targets. In connection with the integrations of our acquisitions, we have experienced some delays in obtaining anticipated cost savings and increases in past due receivables due to delays in integrations and technology enhancements required of our infrastructure. Acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nrisk in retaining key acquired management, employees and acquired customers;\n\u2022\nthe impairment or loss of relationships with customers, resellers and strategic partners of the companies we acquired or with our customers, resellers and strategic partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;\n\u2022\n\u2022\nassumption of known or unknown contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of the operations, technology, services and personnel of the acquired assets or company, including the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a publicly traded company;\n\u2022\nentry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\npotential adverse financial impact from failure of acquisitions to meet revenue and earnings expectations;\n\u2022\nadverse financial impact from the incurrence of acquisition-related costs beyond expectations as we execute on our integration plans;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with currency and regulated risks;\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate an acquisition;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nregional economic and political conditions.\nWe have also made strategic investments in a number of companies and are likely to experience similar risks in connection with these investments or any future investments, including the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected. If we fail to adequately manage these risks, our acquisitions and strategic investments may not result in revenue growth, operational synergies or service or technology enhancements, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIndemnification claims stemming from the sale of our PGiSend business could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEasyLink, the entity that purchased our PGiSend business, has made several indemnification claims, including the state telecommunications excise and corporate tax matters discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, and may make additional claims. We will incur expenses to resolve such indemnification claims, which could harm our operating results and may divert management attention from our continuing operations. In addition, OpenText acquired EasyLink in July 2012, which may delay our ability to resolve these indemnification claims.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, we may be unable to compete effectively or operate profitably.\nTo some degree, our commercial success depends on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. Our ability to continue to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights will depend upon, among other things, complex legal and factual questions, and the standards regarding the procurement and enforcement of intellectual property rights are evolving constantly. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great extent as the laws of the United States. We can offer no assurance that the protections that are in place at any given time will successfully preclude others from using similar technologies. We could incur substantial costs in enforcing our intellectual property against infringement. Even if our pending domestic and foreign patent applications should issue, the various patents may not result in a scope of protection against all competitors using similar alternative technologies. Moreover, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, and how much protection will be realized by any particular patent is uncertain.\nChallenges against our intellectual property, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs.\nOur intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets in the general areas of information services, telecommunications, computer telephony and the Internet. From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we have received and expect to continue to receive notices, or be subject to third-party claims or challenges, alleging that our current or future products or services infringe or misuse the patent, trademark, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights of third parties. The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to challenges or litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, and we are unable to predict whether our business would be affected by such litigation. In addition, our use of open source software in some of our products may make us vulnerable to claims that our products infringe, misappropriate or misuse third-party intellectual property rights. Our resellers or customers also may allege that we are obligated to indemnify them for similar claims made against them. We evaluate such claims when they arise to determine whether the claims are valid and whether it would be more effective reach an amicable settlement, to obtain a license or to dispute the claims. We have in the past obtained a license from a patent owner claiming infringement or misuse. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we are unable to predict the outcome of any proceedings or claims, and an adverse outcome could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We ultimately may not prevail on any such claims and any claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than we have to pursue litigation of these types of claims. Furthermore, there is an increased risk that confidential information could be compromised during litigation or that public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or interim proceedings would be perceived by analysts or inventors as negatively impacting our business. Any claim, whether with or without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe time consuming and a diversion to management;\n\u2022\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u2022\ncause delays in introducing new services or enhancements; and\n\u2022\nresult in costly royalty or licensing agreements.\nIf a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nRegulatory and legislative changes may discourage our customers from using some of our services and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nRegulatory and legislative changes have imposed, or could impose, additional restrictions that may impact our business, including the passage of federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations relating to telecommunications services and to data privacy. The application of these laws and regulations to our services is often unclear, and the laws and regulations sometimes conflict with one another. Our business is affected by regulatory decisions, trends and policies made by international, federal and state telecommunications regulatory agencies, including the FCC and state public service or utility commissions, as well as state and local taxing authorities, among others. Regulatory change is an ongoing process, and such changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy affecting our activities and those of our competitors could significantly influence how we operate our business and introduce new products and services. Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot predict how existing or future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products or services.\nHistorically, we have viewed our conferencing services as private carrier teleconferencing services and as such we have not submitted to all regulations applicable to traditional common carrier telecommunication services in the United States. However, it is possible that the FCC may require us to submit to such regulations under the Communications Act. The extent to which our services are viewed as the provision of traditional common carrier services will affect the federal regulations with which we must comply. In addition, if telecommunications regulatory authorities disagree with our methodology or classification of our services and increase our contribution obligation to USF or conclude that our services are subject to additional regulations and requirements, we may not be able to recoup such fees from our customers, which would negatively affect our results of operations. It is possible that state regulatory authorities may also seek to require us to submit to similar regulations under various state laws and that state or local taxing authorities may similarly attempt to subject our conferencing solutions to their telecommunications excise tax statutes or universal service regulations and remittance requirements.\nFurther, through our Powwownow acquisition, a portion of our operations in the European Union are regulated and supervised by Ofcom and BNetzA, among other regulators. In particular, Ofcom has recently adopted a new regime applying to non-geographic calling services. It is currently anticipated that, once implemented, such changes will have no material adverse impact on our business in the United Kingdom.\nWe cannot predict how regulatory requirements may affect customer demand for our collaboration solutions or our existing or future competitors, as well as whether regulatory or taxing authorities will impose additional requirements, regulations, charges or taxes on the provision of certain of our services. Although we use reasonable efforts to monitor applicable regulatory requirements, if we fail to comply with any applicable government regulations, become subject to investigation by regulators, or are required to submit to the jurisdiction of state government authorities as providers of common carrier telecommunications services, we could become subject to additional reporting and compliance obligations and/or could be subject to litigation, enforcement actions, fines, forfeitures, taxes, regulatory surcharge remittance requirements or other penalties arising from any noncompliance. Subjecting our services to these regulations would increase our operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany states and foreign jurisdictions have passed laws requiring notification to consumers and to organizations that provide personal information to third parties when there is a security breach of personal data, including credit card and other personally identifiable information. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. For example, in January 2012, the European Commission proposed sweeping changes to its data protection rules that, if enacted, would impose more stringent operational requirements on our business and significant penalties for noncompliance. Those proposed rules remain under review and may be revised further. Failure to comply with any applicable data privacy laws could subject us to litigation, damages, fines, criminal penalties, adverse publicity and other losses that could harm our business. Further, any failure by us to protect our users\u2019 or our users\u2019 customers or employees\u2019 privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, to the extent we may be considered a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d under the HIPAA privacy and security rules, violations of\nthese rules could subject us to criminal and civil penalties, as well as possible contractual penalties and other losses that could harm our business. Although we believe we comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, we could nevertheless be subject to litigation, fines, losses or other penalties under such laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to International Operations and Expansion\nThere are risks inherent in international operations that could hinder our international growth strategy.\nOur ability to achieve future success will depend in part on the expansion of our international operations. For example, we have expanded into Brazil, China and India in addition to acquiring companies with international presences. Conducting our business internationally presents numerous inherent difficulties and risks that could prevent us from selling our services in other countries or hinder our expansion once we have established international operations, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nburdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws and regulations that may be inconsistent from country to country;\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations, licensing requirements and business practices that may favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership or investment;\n\u2022\nactivities by our employees, resellers or agents, especially in countries with developing economies, that are prohibited by laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other foreign anti-corruption laws despite our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws;\n\u2022\nantitrust and fair trade practices regulations;\n\u2022\nexport restrictions and controls relating to technology;\n\u2022\ndata privacy laws that may apply to the transmission of our customers\u2019 data across international borders;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing and maintaining strategic reseller and distribution relationships, including in certain international markets in which we do not have a local presence;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations including utilizing foreign telecommunication providers;\n\u2022\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\npotentially weaker protection for our intellectual property than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing our rights abroad;\n\u2022\naccounting (including managing internal control over financial reporting in our non-U.S. subsidiaries), tax and legal complexities arising from international operations;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and collection difficulties;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including terrorist activity and war;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in transferring funds generated overseas to the United States in a tax efficient manner;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity specific to certain parts of the world, including during the summer months in Europe; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA risk inherent in our international operations is the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We have a global presence in 25 countries and in 2014 approximately 39.8% of our consolidated net revenue and 34.6% of our operating expenses were generated in countries outside the United States. As a result, we may experience material losses in revenue and earnings from fluctuations in foreign currencies. For example, we estimate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2014 negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $2.5 million as compared to 2013. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar will adversely affect the value of our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings and could lead us to increase international pricing, which could potentially reduce demand for our products. We anticipate that such fluctuations will continue to impact our financial results. We cannot predict when this volatility will cease or the extent of its impact on our future financial results. We typically denominate foreign transactions in foreign currencies and have not engaged in hedging transactions, although we may engage in hedging transactions from time to time in the future relating to foreign currency exchange rates.
