{"cik": "855658", "company": "LATTICE SEMICONDUCTOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock. If any of the risks described below occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial results.\nWe rely on a limited number of independent suppliers for the manufacture of all of our products and a failure by our suppliers to provide timely, cost-effective, and quality products could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe depend on independent foundries to supply silicon wafers for our products. These foundries include Fujitsu in Japan, which supplies the majority of our programmable logic wafers, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which supplies most of our HDMI and MHL integrated circuits. We negotiate wafer volumes, prices, and other terms with our foundry partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis typically resulting in short-term agreements which do not ensure long-term supply or allocation commitments. We rely on our foundry partners to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes. If the foundries that supply our wafers experience manufacturing problems, including unacceptable yields, delays in the realization of the requisite process technologies, or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies, our operating results could be adversely affected. If for any reason the foundries are unable to, or do not, manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or continue to manufacture a product for the full life of the product, we may be required to prematurely limit or discontinue the sales of certain products or incur significant costs to transfer products to other foundries, and our customer relationships and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, weak economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and cause them to limit or discontinue their business operations, resulting in shortages of supply and an inability to meet their commitments to us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nA disruption of our foundry partners' operations as a result of a fire, earthquake, act of terrorism, political or labor unrest, governmental uncertainty, war, disease, or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, or any other reason, could disrupt our wafer supply and could adversely affect our operating results.\nEstablishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry relationships requires the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If we fail to maintain our foundry relationships, or elect or are required to change foundries, we will incur significant costs and manufacturing delays. The success of certain of our next generation products is dependent upon our ability to successfully partner with Fujitsu, Taiwan Semiconductor and other foundry partners. If for any reason one or more of our foundry partners does not provide its facilities and support for our development efforts, we may be unable to effectively develop new products in a timely manner.\nShould a change in foundry relationships be required, we may be unsuccessful in establishing new foundry relationships for our current or next generation products, or we may incur substantial cost and or manufacturing delays until we form and ramp relationships, and migrate products, each of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe Consumer end market is rapidly changing and cyclical, and a downturn in this end market or our failure to accurately predict the frequency, duration, timing, and severity of these cycles could adversely affect our financial condition and results.\nWith the acquisition of Silicon Image, the Consumer end market has increased in importance to us. Revenue from the Consumer end market accounted for 31% of our revenue in fiscal 2015. Revenue from the Consumer end market consists primarily of revenue from our products designed and used in a broad range of consumer electronics products including smartphones, tablets and e-readers, wearables, accessories such as chargers and docks, Ultra High-Definition (UHD) TVs, Digital SLR cameras, drones, and other connected devices. This market is characterized by rapidly changing requirements and product features and volatility in consumer demand. Our success in this market will depend principally on our ability to:\n\u2022\nmeet the market windows for consumer products;\n\u2022\npredict technology and market trends;\n\u2022\ndevelop IP cores to meet emerging market needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nmaintain multiple design wins across different markets and customers to dampen the effects of market volatility;\n\u2022\nbe designed into our customers' products; and\n\u2022\navoid cancellations or delay of products.\nOur inability to accomplish any of the foregoing, or to offset the volatility of this end market through diversification into other markets, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Cyclicality in the Consumer end market could periodically result in higher or lower levels of revenue and revenue concentration with a single or small number of customers. In addition, rapid changes in this market may affect demand for our products, may cause our revenue derived from sales in this market to vary significantly over time, adversely affecting our financial results.\nA downturn in the Communications end market could cause a meaningful reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results.\nRevenue from the Communications end market accounted for 28% of our revenue in fiscal 2015. Three of our top five programmable logic customers participate primarily in the Communications end market. In the past, cyclical weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the Communications end market has adversely affected our revenue and operating results. In addition, telecommunication equipment providers are building network infrastructure for which we compete for product sales. Any deterioration in the Communications end market, our end customers' reduction in spending, or a reduction in spending by their customers to support this end market or use of our competitors\u2019 products could lead to a reduction in demand for our products which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. This type of decline impacted our results during 2015.\nWe depend on a concentrated group of customers for a significant part of our revenues. If any of these customers reduce their use of our products, our revenue could decrease significantly.\nA large portion of our revenue depends on sales to a limited number of customers. During fiscal 2015, our top two end customers, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, accounted for 9% and 8%, respectively, of our total revenue as compared to fiscal 2014, which was prior to the acquisition of Silicon Image, during which these same top two customers accounted for 19% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenue. Additionally, during fiscal 2015, our top five end customers accounted for approximately 32% of our total revenue, which was down from fiscal 2014, during which our top five end customers accounted for approximately 45% of our total revenue. If any of these relationships were to diminish, or if these customers were to develop their own solutions, or adopt alternative solutions or competitors' solutions, our results could be adversely affected.\nWhile we strive to maintain a strong relationship with our customers, their continued use of our products is frequently reevaluated, as certain of our customers' product life cycles are relatively short and they continually develop new products. The selection process for our products to be included in our customers' new products is highly competitive. There are no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced by these customers. For example, in December 2014, one of its largest customers informed Silicon Image that the customer had decided not to include Silicon Image\u2019s MHL functionality in certain designs in order to reduce costs. Any significant loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, one or more of these customers, or their failure to meet their commitments to us, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If any one or more of our concentrated group of customers were to experience significantly adverse financial conditions, our financial condition and business could be adversely affected as well, as occurred when Silicon Image\u2019s fiscal 2014 mobile product revenue decreased as a result of a significant production slowdown by one of its key customers.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments and strategic partnerships present risks, and we may not realize the goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.\nOn March 10, 2015, we acquired Silicon Image, and we may make further acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. Acquisitions and strategic investments, including our acquisition of Silicon Image, present risks, including:\n\u2022\nour ongoing business may be disrupted and our management's attention may be diverted by investment, acquisition, transition, or integration activities;\n\u2022\nan acquisition or strategic investment may not perform as well or further our business strategy as we expected, and we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected;\n\u2022\nwe may incur unexpected costs, claims, or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may discover adverse conditions post-acquisition that are not covered by representations and warranties;\n\u2022\nwe may increase some of our risks, such as increasing customer or end product concentration;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines;\n\u2022\nwe may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products, and in general and administrative functions that support such products;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating business systems, processes, and tools, such as accounting software, inventory management systems, or revenue systems which may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nour liquidity and/or capital structure may be adversely impacted;\n\u2022\nour strategic investments may not perform as expected;\n\u2022\nwe may experience unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions and strategic investments pursuant to U.S. GAAP;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating acquired entities into our global tax structure with potentially negative impacts on our effective tax rate;\n\u2022\nif the acquisition or strategic investment does not perform as projected, we might take a charge to earnings due to impaired goodwill;\n\u2022\nwe may divest certain assets of acquired businesses, leading to charges against earnings; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience unexpected negative responses from vendors or customers to the acquisition, which may adversely impact our operations.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions or strategic investments. In addition, we may enter into strategic partnerships with third parties with the goal of gaining access to new and innovative products and technologies. Strategic partnerships pose many of the same risks as do acquisitions or investments.\nWe do not guarantee that we will be able to complete any future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from any of our past or future acquisitions, strategic investments, or strategic partnerships. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations, if at all. A sustained decline in the price of our common stock may make it more difficult and expensive to initiate or complete additional acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms.\nAs a result of current year and past acquisitions, as of January 2, 2016, we had $267.5 million in goodwill and $162.6 million in net intangible assets on our balance sheet, net of impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2015. We are required under U.S. GAAP to test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis, and to test goodwill and long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment at any other time that circumstances arise indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. For purposes of testing for impairment, the Company operates as two reporting units: the core Lattice (\"Core\") business, which includes intellectual property and semiconductor devices, and Qterics, a discrete software-as-a-service business unit in the Lattice legal entity structure. Although these two operating segments constitute two reportable segments, we combine Qterics with our Core business and report them together as one reportable segment due to the immaterial nature of the Qterics segment. Following our assessment of goodwill and long-lived asset impairment in the fourth quarter of 2015, we concluded that goodwill and long-lived assets had been impaired in the Qterics segment. As a result, we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in the Qterics segment amounting to $12.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended January 2, 2016. No impairment charges were recorded for the Core segment in fiscal 2015, and we had no impairment charges in either fiscal 2014 or 2013. There is no assurance that future impairment tests will indicate that goodwill will be deemed recoverable.\nWe depend on distributors to generate a significant portion of our revenue and complete order fulfillment and any adverse change in our relationship or the distributors' financial health, reduction of selling efforts, or inaccuracy in resale reports could harm our sales or result in misreporting our results.\nWe depend on our distributors to sell our products to end customers, complete order fulfillment, and maintain sufficient inventory of our products. Our distributors also provide technical support and other value-added services to our end customers. Resales of product through distributors accounted for 45% of our revenue in 2015, with two distributors accounting for 32% of our revenue in 2015. With the acquisition of Silicon Image, we expect that distributors will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue.\nWe expect our distributors to generate a significant portion of our revenue in the future. Any adverse change to our relationships with our distributors or a failure by one or more of our distributors to perform its obligations to us could have a material impact on our business. In addition, a significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nThe financial health of our distributors is important to our success. Economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of one or more of our distributors. This could result in the inability of distributors to finance the purchase of our products or cause the distributors to delay payment of their obligation to us and increase our credit risk. If the financial health of our distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nSince we have limited ability to forecast inventory levels at our end customers, it is possible that there may be significant build-up of inventories in the distributor channel, with the OEM or the OEM\u2019s contract manufacturer. Such a buildup could result in a slowdown in orders, requests for returns from customers, or requests to move out planned shipments. This could adversely affect our revenues and profits. Any failure to manage these challenges could disrupt or reduce sales of our products and unfavorably impact our financial results.\nWe depend on the timeliness and accuracy of resale reports from our distributors; late or inaccurate resale reports could have a detrimental effect on our ability to properly recognize revenue and our ability to predict future sales.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could reduce our strategic flexibility and liquidity and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Silicon Image, we entered into a secured Credit Agreement providing for a $350 million term loan. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our U.S. subsidiaries. Our obligations include a requirement to pay up to 75% of our excess cash flow toward repayment of the facility. The Credit Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, payment of dividends, and additional indebtedness. The amount and terms of our indebtedness, as well as our credit rating, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nour cash flow from operations may be allocated to the payment of outstanding indebtedness, and not to research and development, operations or business growth;\n\u2022\nwe might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the facility and to fund other liquidity needs;\n\u2022\nour ability to make distributions to our stockholders in a sale or liquidation may be limited until any balance on the facility is repaid in full; and\n\u2022\nour ability to incur additional debt, including for working capital, acquisitions, or other needs, is more limited.\nIf we breach a loan covenant, the lenders could accelerate the repayment of the term loan. We might not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness upon a default. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection proceedings with respect to our assets and subsidiaries securing the facility, which could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nOur success and future revenue depends on our ability to innovate, develop and introduce new products that achieve customer and market acceptance, and to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing, and sales resources. We currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products, as well as numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions such as applications processor, application specific standard product, microcontroller, analog, and digital signal processing technologies. Competition from these semiconductor companies may intensify as we offer more products in any of our end markets. These competitors include established, multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technology and product evolution, generally followed by a relatively longer process of ramping up to volume production on advanced technologies. Our markets are also characterized by evolving industry standards, frequent new product introduction, short product life cycles, and increased demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometry. Our competitive position and success depends on our ability to innovate, develop, and introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption, form factor, and performance addressing the evolving needs of the markets we serve. These new products typically are more technologically complex than their predecessors.\nOur future growth and the success of new product introductions depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ntimely completion and introduction of new product designs;\n\u2022\nability to generate new design opportunities and design wins, including those which result in sales of significant volume;\n\u2022\navailability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products;\n\u2022\nability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies;\n\u2022\nachieving acceptable yields and obtaining adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors;\n\u2022\nability to obtain advanced packaging;\n\u2022\navailability of supporting software design tools;\n\u2022\nutilization of predefined IP logic;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our MHL-enabled and wireless mobile products, and our 60 GHz wireless products;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our customers' products.\nOur product innovation and development efforts may not be successful; our new products, MHL-enabled products, and 60GHz wireless products may not achieve market or customer acceptance; and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production to achieve acceptable cost. Revenue relating to our mature products is expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenue derived from our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining acceptable margins. To the extent such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or that our products do not achieve market acceptance or market acceptance at acceptable pricing, our forecasts of future revenue, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral economic conditions and deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions, or our customers\u2019 perceptions of the economic environment, may negatively affect customer demand for our products and services and result in delayed or decreased spending. Weak global economic conditions in the past have resulted in weak demand for our products in certain geographies and had an adverse impact on our results of operations. If weak economic conditions persist or worsen, our business could be harmed due to customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders. In addition, the inability of customers to obtain credit, the insolvency of one or more customers, or the insolvency of key suppliers could result in sales or production delays. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, require additional restructuring actions, and decrease our revenue and profitability. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nThe intellectual property licensing component of our business strategy increases our business risk and fluctuation of our revenue.\nOur business strategy includes licensing our intellectual property to companies that incorporate it into their respective technologies, which address markets in which we do not directly participate or compete. We also license our intellectual property into markets where we do participate and compete. Our licensing and services revenue may be impacted by the introduction of new technologies by customers in place of the technologies based on our intellectual property, changes in the law that may weaken our ability to prevent the use of our patented technology by others, and changes of selling prices for products using licensed patents. We make no assurance that our licensing customers will continue to license our technology on commercially favorable terms or at all, or that these customers will introduce and sell products incorporating our technology, accurately report royalties owed to us, pay agreed upon royalties, honor agreed upon market restrictions, maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or will not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property. Our intellectual property licensing agreements are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones, allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances. Many of these require significant judgments. Additionally, this is a new end market for us, with which we do not yet have extensive experience.\nWe have also generated revenue from the sale of certain patents from our portfolio, generally for technology that we are no longer actively developing. While we plan to continue to monetize our patent portfolio through sales of non-core patents, we may not be able to realize adequate interest or prices for those patents. Accordingly, we do not provide assurance that we will continue to generate revenue from these sales. In addition, although we seek to be strategic in our decisions to sell patents, we might incur reputational harm if a purchaser of our patents sues one of our customers for infringement of the purchased patent, and we might later decide to enter a space that requires the use of one or more of the patents we sold.\nOur licensing and services revenue fluctuates, sometimes significantly, from period to period because it is heavily dependent on a few key transactions being completed in a given period, the timing of which is difficult to predict and may not match our expectations. Because of its high margin, the licensing and services revenue portion of our overall revenue can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit and profitability. Generating revenue from intellectual property licenses is a lengthy and complex process that may last beyond the period in which our efforts begin, and the accounting rules governing the recognition of revenue from intellectual property licensing transactions are increasingly complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, the amount of license revenue recognized in any period may differ significantly from our expectations.\nA single large customer may be in a position to demand certain functionality, pricing or timing requirements that may detract from or interfere with our normal business activities. If this happens, delays in our normal development schedules could occur, causing our products to miss market windows thereby reducing the total number of units sold of a particular product.\nThe products we develop are complex and require significant planning and resources. In the Consumer end market, new products are typically introduced early in the year, often in association with key trade shows. In order to meet these deadlines, our customers must complete their product development by year-end, which usually means we must ship sample parts in early spring. If we cannot ship sample parts in early spring, customers may be forced to remove the feature provided by our product,\nuse a competitor\u2019s product, or use an alternate technology in order to meet their timelines. We plan our product development with these market windows in mind, but if we receive requests from a large customer to deploy resources to meet their requirements or work on a specific solution, our normal development path could be delayed, causing us to miss sample deadlines and therefore future revenues.\nA number of factors, including our inventory strategy, can impact our gross margins.\nA number of factors, including yield, wafer pricing, cost of packaging raw materials, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and/or end market mix, and pricing strategies, can cause our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because a significant portion of our business is based on turns within the same quarter.\nOur customers typically test and evaluate our products prior to deciding to design our product into their own products, and then require additional time to begin volume production of those products. This lengthy sales cycle may cause us to experience significant delays and to incur additional inventory costs until we generate revenue from our products. It is possible that we may never generate any revenue from products after incurring significant expenditures.\nWhile our sales cycles are typically long, our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate. In addition, our inventory levels may be higher than historical norms, from time to time, due to inventory build decisions aimed at reducing direct material cost or enabling responsiveness to expected demand. In the event the expected demand does not materialize, or if our short sales cycle does not generate sufficient revenue, we may be subject to incremental excess and obsolescence costs. In addition, future product cost reductions could impact our inventory valuation, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe and our connectivity customers depend on the availability of certain functions and capabilities within mobile and personal computing operating systems over which we may have no control. New releases of these operating systems may render certain of our products inoperable or may require significant engineering effort to create new device driver software.\nCertain portions of our business operate within a market that is dominated by a few key OEMs. These OEMs could play a role in driving the growth of our business or could prevent our growth through deliberate or non-deliberate action. We do not have a presence in the iOS or Windows eco-systems or in all Android devices. Our success and ability to grow depend upon our ability to continue to be successful within the Android eco-system or gain significant traction within the iOS eco-system or Windows eco-system. Failure to maintain and grow our presence in these key eco-systems could adversely affect unit volumes.\nFurther, many of our products depend on the availability of certain functionality in the device operating system, typically Android, Linux, Windows, or iOS. Certain operating system primitives are needed to support video output. We have no control over these operating systems or the companies that produce them, and it is unlikely that we could influence any internal decision these companies make that may have a negative impact on our integrated circuits and their function. Updates to these operating systems that, for example, change the way video is output or remove the ability to output video could materially affect sales of MHL and HDMI integrated circuits.\nProducts targeted to personal computing or mobile, laptop, or notebook designs often require device driver software to operate. This software is difficult to produce and may require certifications before being released. Failure to produce this software could have a negative impact on our relation with operating system providers and may damage our reputation with end consumers as a quality supplier of products.\nWe may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses.\nTo remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller geometries. This requires us to change the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products as well as standard cells and other integrated circuit designs we may use in multiple products. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs. The transition to lower nanometer geometry process technologies will result in significantly higher mask and prototyping costs, as well as additional expenditures for engineering design tools.\nWe depend on our relationships with our foundry partners to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We make no assurance that our foundry partners will be able to effectively manage the transition in a timely manner, or at all. If we or any of our foundry partners experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses, all of which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial condition and operating results.\nShortages in, or increased costs of, wafers and materials could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.\nWorldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is relatively inelastic. If the demand for silicon wafers or assembly material materially exceeds market supply, our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited. A shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet product demand and therefore reduce our revenue. In addition, silicon wafers constitute a material portion of our product cost. If we are unable to purchase wafers at favorable prices, our gross margins will be adversely affected.\nWe depend on independent contractors for most of our assembly and test services, and disruption of these services, or an increased in cost of these services, could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on subcontractors to assemble, test, and ship our products with acceptable quality and yield levels. Our operations and operating results may be adversely affected if we experience problems with our subcontractors that impact the delivery of product to our customers. Those problems include: prolonged inability to obtain wafers or packaging materials with competitive performance and cost attributes; inability to achieve adequate yields or timely delivery; disruption or defects in assembly, test, or shipping services; or delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes or ramping up volume for new products,. Economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of our subcontractors and result in their inability to meet their commitments to us resulting in product shortages, quality assurance problems, reduced revenue, and/or increased costs which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past, we have experienced delays in obtaining assembled and tested products and in securing assembly and test capacity commitments from our suppliers. We currently anticipate that our assembly and test capacity commitments are adequate; however, these existing commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods. We negotiate assembly and test prices and capacity commitments from our contractors on a periodic basis. If any of our assembly or test contractors reduce their capacity commitment or increase their prices, and we cannot find alternative sources, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry routinely experiences cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to downturns in the semiconductor industry. These downturns can be severe and prolonged and can result in price erosion and weak demand for our products. Weak demand for our products resulting from general economic conditions affecting the end markets we serve or the semiconductor industry specifically and reduced spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. The dynamics of the markets in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results.\nOur expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations of future sales. Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to facilities, capital equipment, and other overhead, are relatively fixed. We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur participation in HDMI and MHL includes our acting as agent for these consortia for which we receive adopter fees. There is no guarantee that we will continue to act as agent for either or both of these standards, in which case we may lose adopter fees.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary, HDMI Licensing, LLC, we act as agent of the HDMI consortium and are responsible for promoting and administering the specification. We receive all of the adopter fees paid by adopters of the HDMI specification in connection with our role as agent. We are currently in discussions with the other HDMI founders regarding a restructuring of our role as agent. While not concluded, we believe these discussions will likely result in a narrowing of our agent functions, resulting in a lowering of the adopter fees received by us in the future.\nWe share HDMI royalties with the other HDMI founders based on an allocation formula, which is reviewed every three years. The current royalty sharing formula covers the period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016. Our portion of the royalty allocation has declined for the last several years, and in 2015 we received between 24% to 25% of the royalty allocation. If the level of this royalty allocation continues to decline, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary, MHL, LLC, we act as agent of the MHL specification and are responsible for promoting and administering the specification. As agent, we are entitled to receive license fees paid by adopters of the MHL specification sufficient to reimburse us for the costs we incur to promote and administer the specification. Given the limited number of MHL adopters to date, we do not believe the license fees paid by such adopters will be sufficient to reimburse us for these costs and we make no assurance that the license fees paid by MHL adopters will ever be sufficient to reimburse us the costs we incur as agent of the specification.\nWe currently intend to promote and continue to be involved and actively participate in other standard setting initiatives. For example, through Silicon Image\u2019s acquisition of SiBEAM, Inc. in May 2011, it achieved SiBEAM\u2019s prior position as founder and chair of the WirelessHD Consortium. We may decide to license additional elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing, developing, promoting, or adopting standards in our target markets, in certain circumstances at little or no cost. This may make it easier for others to compete with us in such markets. In addition, even if we receive license fees or royalties in connection with the licensing of our intellectual property, we make no assurance that such license fees or royalties will compensate us adequately.\nWe rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly may cause business disruptions.\nWe rely in part on various information technology (\"IT\") systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting, and we regularly make changes to improve them as necessary by periodically implementing new, or upgrading or enhancing existing, operational and IT systems, procedures, and controls. We are undergoing a significant integration and systems implementation as we integrate the operations and systems of Silicon Image into our operations and systems following the acquisition. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to or integration of, new or enhanced systems, procedures, or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. In addition, we are presently upgrading our main enterprise resource planning system, which if not completed on time and as planned, could result in cost overruns or limit our ability to manufacture and ship products as planned. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties or delays in managing and integrating them could result in excessive cost or business disruption.\nOur failure to control unauthorized access to our IT systems may cause problems with key business partners or liability.\nWe may be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security breach or cyber-attack. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. Cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance, or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and to assess the damage caused by them. In the past, third parties have attempted to penetrate and/or infect our network and systems with malicious software in an effort to gain access to our network and systems.\nThese data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations, and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. Our reputation, brand, and business could be significantly harmed, and we could be subject to third party claims in the event of such a security breach.\nForeign sales, accounting for the majority of our revenue, are subject to various risks associated with selling in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from sales outside of the United States. Accordingly, if we experience a decline in foreign sales, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our foreign sales are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic conditions;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate volatility;\n\u2022\ngovernmental stimulus packages, controls, and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental policies that promote development and consumption of domestic products;\n\u2022\nexport license requirements, foreign trade compliance matters, and restrictions on the use of technology;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war, terrorism, or pandemic disease;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rates, tariffs, or freight rates;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlonger receivable collection periods;\n\u2022\nnatural or man-made disasters in the countries where we sell our products;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in transportation;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in the global communication infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nlabor regulations.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nWe have significant international operations exposing us to various economic, regulatory, political, and business risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, and operational and research and development sites in China, India, the Philippines, and other Asian locations. In addition, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries; have our commercial products assembled, packaged, and tested by subcontractors located outside of the United States; and rely on an international service provider for inventory management, order fulfillment, and direct sales logistics.\nThese and other integral business activities outside of the United States are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments including trade barriers; economic sanctions; environmental regulations; import and export regulations; duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions; changes in trade policies; anti-corruption laws; domestic and foreign governmental regulations; potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for intellectual property; disruptions or delays in production or shipments; and instability or fluctuations in currency exchange rates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, with the acquisition of Silicon Image, we have increased the operational challenges of conducting our business in and across multiple geographic regions around the world, especially in the face of different business practices, social norms, and legal standards.\nMoreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political instability, terrorist activity, U.S. or other military actions, or economic crises in countries where our main wafer suppliers, end customers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers are located.\nOur global organizational structure and operations expose us to unanticipated tax consequences.\nOur legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have a global tax structure to more effectively align our corporate structure with our business operations including responsibility for sales and purchasing activities. We created new and realigned existing legal entities; completed intercompany sales of rights to intellectual property, inventory, and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions; and implemented cost-sharing and intellectual property licensing and royalty agreements between our legal entities. We currently operate legal entities in countries where we conduct supply-chain management, design, and sales operations around the world. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. In addition, we are currently conducting further restructuring activities following our acquisition of Silicon Image as we integrate Silicon Image and its subsidiaries, which include numerous foreign entities, into our existing global tax and corporate structures. These integration activities, changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of the Company and its subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, Singapore, and other countries. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws. We compute our effective tax rate using actual jurisdictional profits and losses. Changes in the jurisdictional mix of profits and losses may cause fluctuations in the effective tax rate. Adverse changes in tax rates, our tax assets, and tax liabilities could negatively affect our results in the future.\nWe make no assurance as to what taxes we pay or the ability to estimate our future effective tax rate because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. The U.S. government and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have proposed tax policy changes with respect to the taxation of global operations of multinational companies. As a result, our actual effective tax rate or taxes paid may vary materially from our expectations. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and related interpretations in the countries in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.\nIn general, we warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non-conformance to our specifications and certain other defects. Because our products, including hardware, software, and intellectual property cores, are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology, our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects, whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments. Inability to detect a defect could result in a diversion of our engineering resources from product development efforts, increased engineering expenses to remediate the defect, and increased costs due to customer accommodation or inventory impairment charges. On occasion we have also repaired or replaced certain components, made software fixes, or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product or software defects. If there are significant product defects, the costs to remediate such defects, net of reimbursed amounts from our vendors, if any, or to resolve warranty claims may adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and net income.\nThe nature of our business makes our revenue and gross margin subject to fluctuation and difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and gross margin guidance.\nIn addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers' products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers' designs, the design to volume production process for many of our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, we are dependent upon \"turns,\" orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales weakens our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. The difficulty in forecasting revenues as well as the relative customer and product mix of those revenues inhibits our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and gross margin guidance.\nReductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins.\nThe average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature or may decline as we compete for market share or customer acceptance in competitive markets. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions, and increased unit sales. We also seek to continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, we do not guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our financial results and our ability to compete effectively may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and we rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology, however, we may be unsuccessful in asserting our intellectual property rights or such rights may be invalidated, violated, circumvented, or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright, and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against us in the future. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims, or other legal actions, and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products or require us to pay costly royalties to third parties in connection with sales of our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA material change in the agreements governing encryption keys we use could place additional restrictions on us, or our distributors or contract manufacturers, which could restrict product shipment or significantly increase the cost to track products throughout the distribution chain.\nMany of the components in our products contain encryption keys used in connection with High Definition Content Protection (HDCP). The regulation and distribution of these encryption keys are controlled through license agreements with Digital Content Protection (DCP), a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel Corporation. These license agreements have been modified by DCP from time to time, and such changes could impact us, our distributors, and our customers. An important element of both HDMI and MHL is the ability to implement link protection for high definition (HD), and more recently, 4K UltraHD, content. We implement various aspects of the HDCP link protection within certain parts we sell. We also, for the benefit of our customers, include the necessary HDCP encryption keys in parts we ship to customers. These encryption keys are provided to us from DCP. We have a specific process for tracking and handling these encryption keys. If DCP changes any of the tracking or handling requirements associated with HDCP encryption keys, we may be required to change our manufacturing and distribution processes, which could adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs associated with these products. If we cannot satisfy new requirements for the handling and tracking of encryption keys, we may have to cease shipping or manufacturing certain products.\nOur participation in consortia for the development and promotion of industry standards in certain of our target markets, including the HDMI, MHL, and WirelessHD standards, requires us to license some of our intellectual property for free or under specified terms and conditions, which makes it easier for others to compete with us in such markets.\nAn element of our business strategy includes participating in consortia to establish industry standards in certain of our target markets; promoting and enhancing specifications; and developing and marketing products based on those specifications and future enhancements. We intend to continue participating in consortia that develop and promote the HDMI, MHL, and WirelessHD specifications. In connection with our participation in these consortia, we make certain commitments regarding our intellectual property, in each case with the effect of making certain of our intellectual property available to others, including our competitors, desiring to implement the specification in question. For example, we must license specific elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing the HDMI specification, including enhancements, as long as we remain part of the consortium. Also, we must agree not to assert certain necessary patent claims against other members of the MHL consortium, even if those members may have infringed upon those patents in implementing the MHL specification.\nAccordingly, certain companies that implement these specifications in their products may use specific elements of our intellectual property to compete with us. Although in the case of the HDMI and MHL consortia, there are annual fees and royalties associated with the adopters\u2019 use of the technology, we make no assurance that our shares of such annual fees and royalties will adequately compensate us for having to license or refrain from asserting our intellectual property.\nOur business depends, in part, on the continued adoption and widespread implementation of the HDMI and MHL specifications and the new implementation and adoption of the WirelessHD specifications.\nSilicon Image has depended on its participation in standard setting organizations, such as the HDMI and MHL consortiums, and the widespread adoption and success of those standards. From time to time, competing standards have been established which negatively impact the success of existing standards or jeopardize the creation of new standards.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon the continued adoption and widespread implementation of the HDMI, MHL, and WirelessHD specifications. A significant portion of Silicon Image\u2019s total revenue was derived from the sale of HDMI and MHL-enabled products and the licensing of our HDMI and MHL technology. Silicon Image\u2019s leadership in the market for HDMI and MHL-enabled products and intellectual property has been based on the ability to introduce first-to-market semiconductor and intellectual property solutions to customers and to continue to innovate within the standard. Our inability to continue to drive innovation in the HDMI and MHL specifications could have an adverse effect on our business going forward.\nMHL has not been widely adopted and Silicon Image had a reduction in mobile design wins at one of our largest customers as a result of not including MHL. If other manufacturers who have included MHL in their designs decide that MHL is no longer necessary or cost-effective as a product feature, they too could choose to omit the MHL functionality (and our product) from their designs. Such decisions would adversely affect our revenues. Similarly, if our largest customer decides to remove MHL from other products, our revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe now have 60GHz wireless technology that we hope will be made widely available and adopted by the marketplace through the efforts of the WirelessHD consortium and incorporated into certain of our future products. As with our HDMI and MHL products and intellectual property, our success with this technology will depend on our ability to introduce first-to-market WirelessHD-enabled semiconductor and intellectual property solutions to our customers and to continue to innovate within the WirelessHD standard. WiGig is an example of a competing 60GHz standard that has been created as an alternative high-bandwidth wireless connectivity solution for the personal computing industry. While the WiGig standard has not been in the market as long as the WirelessHD standard, it does represent a viable alternative to WirelessHD for 60GHz connectivity. If WiGig should gain broader adoption before WirelessHD is adopted, it could negatively impact the adoption of WirelessHD.\nAs successor-in-interest to Silicon Image, we have granted Intel Corporation certain rights with respect to our intellectual property, which could allow Intel to develop products that compete with ours or otherwise reduce the value of our intellectual property.\nSilicon Image entered into a patent cross-license agreement with Intel in which each of them granted the other a license to use the patents filed by the grantor prior to a specified date, except for use related to identified types of products. We believe that the scope of this license to Intel excludes our current products and anticipated future products. Intel could, however, exercise its rights under this agreement to use certain of our patents received in the acquisition of Silicon Image to develop and market other products that compete with ours, without payment to us. Additionally, Intel\u2019s rights to these patents could reduce the value of the patents to any third-party who otherwise might be interested in acquiring rights to use these patents in such products. Finally, Intel could endorse competing products, including a competing digital interface, or develop its own proprietary digital interface. Any of these actions could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nLitigation and unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are discussed under Note 20 contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and certain portions of our business.\nWe depend upon a third party to provide inventory management, order fulfillment, and direct sales logistics and disruption of these services could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on a third party vendor to provide cost-effective and efficient supply chain services. Among other activities, these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics, including order fulfillment; inventory management and warehousing; and distribution of inventory to third party distributors. If our third party supply chain partner were to discontinue services for us or its operations are disrupted as a result of a fire, earthquake, act of terrorism, political unrest, governmental uncertainty, war, disease, or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, or any other reason, our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute inventory timely, cost effectively, or at all, would be hindered, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on independent software and hardware developers and disruption of these services could negatively affect our operations and financial results.\nWe rely on independent software and hardware developers for the design, development, supply, and support of intellectual property cores; design and development software; and certain elements of evaluation boards. As a result, failure or significant delay to complete software or deliver hardware in accordance with our plans, specifications, and agreements could disrupt the release of or introduction of new or existing products, which could be detrimental to the capability of our new or existing products to win designs. Any of these delays or inability to complete the design or development could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks, and, as a result, our financial condition and results may be adversely affected.\nWe carry insurance customary for companies in our industry, including, but not limited to, liability, property, and casualty; workers' compensation; and business interruption insurance. We also insure our employees for basic medical expenses. In addition, we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers. Other than the specific areas mentioned above, we are self-insured with respect to most other risks and exposures, and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies. Based on management's assessment and judgment, we have determined that it is more cost effective to self-insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs. The risks and exposures for which we self-insure include, but are not limited to, certain natural disasters, certain product defects, political risk, certain theft, patent infringement, and employment practice matters. Should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event (such as an earthquake) or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self-insured, our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nWe depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers who can respond to market demands and required product innovation. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. From time to time we have effected restructurings which have eliminated a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, we could have difficulty competing in our highly-competitive and innovative environment.\nThe conflict minerals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could result in additional costs and liabilities.\nAs part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission established new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. As these new requirements are fully implemented, they could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor products. There are also costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, including for due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of any required remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Although we filed the required conflict minerals reports in 2014 and 2015, it may be several years before we can fully assess the internal and external cost of compliance of the effect the rules will have on our business.", "PERMNO": 75854, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "LSCC"}
