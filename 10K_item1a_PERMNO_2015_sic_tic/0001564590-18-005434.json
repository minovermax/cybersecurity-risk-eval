RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this Report, as well as the information discussed under the section entitled, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d in evaluating us, our business and your investment in us. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business and financial performance depend on the level of activity in the oil and gas industries.\nApproximately 87% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were derived from sales to companies in the oil and gas industry. As a result, our operations are materially dependent on the levels of activity in oil and gas exploration, development, and production. More specifically, the demand for the proppants we produce is closely related to the number of oil and gas wells completed in geological formations where sand-based proppants are used in fracturing activities. These activity levels are affected by both short- and long-term trends in oil and gas prices, among other factors.\nIn recent years, oil and gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development, and production activity, have experienced significant fluctuations. Worldwide economic, political, and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East, growth in U.S. non-conventional oil production, and initiatives by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other large non-OPEC producers have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to price and volume volatility. In 2016, OPEC producers reached an initial agreement to limit production, and in November 2017, the agreement was extended through December 2018. These agreements contributed to an increase in global oil and gas prices. However, this limit is voluntary and political and other issues may create varying degrees of adherence to this limitation, which could cause volatility and price fluctuations in the demand for oil and gas.\nPrices remain subject to volatility. A return to a reduction in oil and gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and gas exploration, development, production, and well completion activity and may result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the proppants we produce. Such a decline would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and we may not be able to meet our debt obligations. The commercial development of economically-viable alternative energy sources could have a similar effect. Any future decreases in the rate at which oil and gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to the passage of legislation, increased governmental regulation leading to limitations, or prohibitions on exploration and drilling activity, including hydraulic fracturing, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.\nAlthough our indebtedness was significantly reduced in 2016 and 2017 and its maturity extended, it continues to be substantial and increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, or refinance that indebtedness on favorable terms. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $745.0 million of outstanding long-term debt that matures in May and November 2022. Our indebtedness could have other important consequences and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, railcar or other future purchase commitments, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other general corporate purposes.\nIncreasing logistics costs, a lack of dependability or availability of transportation services or infrastructure, and geographic shifts in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTransportation and handling costs are a significant component of the total delivered cost of our products. In many instances, transportation costs can represent 70% to 80% of the delivered cost of frac sand. The high relative cost of transportation could favor suppliers located in close proximity to the customer. In addition, as we continue to expand our sand-based proppant production, we will need increased investment in transportation infrastructure, including terminals and railcars. We contract with truck, rail, ship, and barge services to move sand-based proppants from our production facilities to distribution terminals. Labor disputes, derailments, adverse weather conditions or other environmental events, increased railcar congestion, and other changes to rail freight systems could interrupt or limit available transportation services or result in a significant increase in transportation service rates. Increased costs resulting from these types of events that we are not able to pass on to our customers could impair our ability to deliver our products economically to our customers or to expand our markets. Accordingly, because we are so dependent on rail infrastructure, if there are disruptions of the rail transportation services utilized by us or our customers, and we or our customers are unable to find alternative transportation providers to transport our products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, declining volumes could result in railcar over-capacity, which would lead to railcar storage fees while, at the same time, we would continue to incur lease costs for those railcars in storage.\nA portion of our distribution infrastructure is located in or near oil and gas producing areas. A shift in demand away from areas where we have significant distribution infrastructure or relocation of our customers\u2019 businesses to areas farther from our plants or distribution infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent on timely securing and maintaining various permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Furthermore, state and local governments could impose a moratorium on mining operations in certain areas. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or other permits, including air permits for our coated manufacturing, and water rights or approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our facilities are located near existing and proposed third-party industrial operations that could affect our ability to fully extract, or the manner in which we extract, the mineral reserves to which we have mining rights.\nWe may be adversely affected by decreased or shifted demand for sand-based proppants or the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.\nFrac sand and coated sand are proppants used in the completion and re-completion of oil and gas wells through the process of hydraulic fracturing. A significant shift in demand from sand-based proppants to other proppants, or a shift in demand from higher-margin sand-based proppants to lower-margin sand-based proppants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The development and use of new technology for effective alternative proppants, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could also cause a decline in demand for the sand-based proppants we produce and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur proppant sales are subject to fluctuations in market pricing.\nSubstantially all of our supply agreements involving the sale of sand-based proppants have market-based pricing mechanisms. Accordingly, in periods with decreasing prices, our results of operations may be lower than if our agreements had fixed prices. In periods with increasing prices, our agreements permit us to increase prices; however, our customers may elect to cease purchasing our sand-based proppants if they do not agree with our price increases or are able to find alternative, cheaper sources of supply. Furthermore, certain volume-based supply agreements may influence the ability to fully capture current market pricings. These pricing provisions may result in significant variability in our results of operations and cash flows from period to period.\nChanges in supply and demand dynamics could also impact market pricing for proppants. A number of existing frac sand providers and new market entrants have recently announced reserve acquisitions, processing capacity expansions and greenfield projects. In periods where sources of supply of raw frac sand exceed market demand, market prices for frac sand may decline and our results of operations and cash flows may continue to decline, be volatile, or otherwise be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to complete greenfield development or expansion projects or, if we do, we may not realize the expected benefits.\nAny greenfield development or expansion project requires us to spend substantial capital and obtain numerous state and local permits. A decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could prevent us from pursuing the development or expansion project. In West Texas, our current or future expansion plans could be slowed or halted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or other agencies due to conservation efforts targeted at the habitat of the dunes sagebrush lizard. In addition, if the demand for our products declines during the period we experience delays in raising capital or completing the permitting process, we may not realize the expected benefits from our greenfield facility or expansion project. Furthermore, our new or modified facilities may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect. The inability to complete greenfield development or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis and in turn grow our business could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, contractual restrictions and patents to protect our proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nOur commercial success depends on our proprietary information and technologies, know-how and other intellectual property. Because of the technical nature of our business, we rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights, particularly with respect to our coated products. The measures we take to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient. Failure to protect, monitor, and control the use of our existing intellectual property rights could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. It is possible that our competitors or others could independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us. As a result, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, third parties or our employees may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could also harm our business and results of operations. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.\nIn addition, third parties may claim that our products infringe or otherwise violate their patents or other proprietary rights and seek corresponding damages or injunctive relief. Defending ourselves against such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could subject us to significant liability to third parties (potentially including treble damages) or temporary or permanent injunctions prohibiting the manufacture or sale of our products, the use of our technologies or the conduct of our business. Any adverse outcome could also require us to seek licenses from third parties (which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all) or to make substantial one-time or ongoing royalty payments. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation. In addition, we may not have insurance coverage in\nconnection with such litigation and may have to bear all costs arising from any such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe development and marketing of Propel SSP\u00ae products may prove to be unsuccessful.\nThe technology supporting Propel SSP\u00ae products is unproven through field trials. Although the results of field trials have been encouraging, and some customers are using Propel SSP\u00ae products on a commercial basis in all of thier wells, additional testing ultimately may demonstrate that the product is ineffective or not commercially viable. A return to or a prolonged decline in the oil and gas market may make the adoption of higher-value products, such as Propel SSP\u00ae products, more difficult. Additionally, competitive products could be developed and marketed. A failure to capitalize on Propel SSP\u00ae products in commercial application would result in a significant unrecouped investment and the failure to realize certain anticipated benefits, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as remedial actions with regard to the contractual agreement with Soane Energy LLC. For more information on Propel SSP\u00ae products, please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions.\u201d\nOur future performance will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to appropriately react to potential fluctuations in demand for and supply of sand-based proppants.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market that is characterized by several large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional or local producers. Competition in the industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering, and technical support. In the proppant business, we compete with producers such as Badger Mining Corporation, CARBO Ceramics Inc., Emerge Energy Services LP, Hi-Crush Partners, LP, Momentive Performance Materials Inc., Preferred Sands LLC, Smart Sand Inc., Unimin Corporation, and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. Certain of our large competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production facilities that are located closer to key customers than ours.\nWe also compete with smaller, regional or local producers. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of small producers servicing the sand-based proppants market which could result in increased competition and pricing pressure in certain market conditions. In addition, oil and gas exploration and production companies and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services could acquire their own sand reserves, expand their existing sand-based proppant production capacity or otherwise fulfill their own proppant requirements and existing or new sand-based proppant producers could add to or expand their sand-based proppants production capacity, which could increase competition in the proppant industry. We may not be able to compete successfully against either our larger or smaller competitors in the future, and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA large portion of our sales is generated by a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, our largest customers could adversely affect our operations.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, three customers exceeded 10% of revenues. These customers collectively accounted for 45% of revenues in 2017. In the year ended December 31, 2016, two customers exceeded 10% of revenues. These customers collectively accounted for 42% of revenues in 2016. These customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of our sand-based proppants in the future due to a variety of reasons. Over the course of our relationships, we have sold proppant to these customers on a purchase order basis and pursuant to supply agreements. We currently have supply agreements with these customers that contain customary termination provisions for bankruptcy related events and uncured breaches of the applicable agreement. If any of our major customers substantially reduces or altogether ceases purchasing our sand-based proppants and we are not able to generate replacement sales of sand-based proppants into the market, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected for a short-term period until such time as we generate replacement sales in the market.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations are concentrated solely in the global oilfield services industry which, as described above, is subject to volatility and therefore credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use the production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe demand for industrial and recreational sand fluctuates, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our sales are to customers in industries that have historically been cyclical, such as glassmaking, building products and foundry. During periods of economic slowdown, our customers often reduce their production rates and also reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. Such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties.\nDemand in many of the end markets for industrial and recreational sand is driven by the construction and automotive industries. For example, the flat glass market depends on the automotive and commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets. The market for industrial sand used to manufacture building products is driven primarily by demand in the construction markets. The demand for foundry silica substantially depends on the rate of automobile, light truck and heavy equipment production. Other factors influencing the demand for industrial and recreational sand include (i) the substitution of plastic or other materials for glass, (ii) competition from offshore producers of glass products, (iii) changes in demand for our products due to technological innovations, and (iv) prices, availability, and other factors relating to our products.\nWe cannot predict or control the factors that affect demand for our products. Negative developments in the above factors, among others, could cause the demand for industrial and recreational sand to decline, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.\nOur operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond our control and could adversely affect production levels and costs, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.\nOur mining, processing and production facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the proppant and industrial and recreational sand industries. These risks include:\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of transportation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of natural gas or electricity;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;\n\u2022\ncave-ins, pit wall failures, or rock falls, particularly in underground mines;\n\u2022\nunanticipated ground, grade, or water conditions;\n\u2022\nextreme seasonal weather conditions;\n\u2022\nhazardous or catastrophic weather conditions or events, including flooding, tornadoes, and hurricanes, and the physical impacts of climate change;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards;\n\u2022\nindustrial accidents;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) or increased public scrutiny related to the mining and the drilling and well completion industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;\n\u2022\ninability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on blasting and mining operations, including potential moratoriums on mining as result of local activism or complaints;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;\n\u2022\nreduction in the amount of water available for processing;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity breaches;\n\u2022\nlate delivery of supplies;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, or other accidents; and\n\u2022\nfacility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions\nAny of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, our mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses, or possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining properties or production facilities could have a material adverse effect on us.\nNot all of these risks are reasonably insurable, and our insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions, and endorsements. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet our needs in the event of loss and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on us.\nA significant portion of our sales is generated at our Wedron Silica facility. Any adverse developments at this plant could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 67% of our total volumes were produced at our Wedron Silica Facility. As of December 31, 2017, this facility accounts for approximately 43% of our annual sand processing capacity and approximately 25% of our annual coating capacity. A casualty event or other adverse event affecting the production at this plant, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events or weather (including floods, windstorms, ice storms, freezing temperatures, or tornadoes), adverse government regulatory impacts, private actions by residents of Wedron or surrounding communities, decreased demand for the products this plant produces, adverse developments affecting this plant\u2019s customers, or transportation-related constraints, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe manufacture of value-added proppants is an important process for us and is dependent on the availability of raw materials.\nIf we are unable to secure adequate, cost effective supply commitments for the raw materials associated with value-added proppants our ability to sell this product to the marketplace at profitable margins may be adversely impacted. Decreased sales of value-added proppants or the inability to control the costs associated with manufacturing and distribution of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results from operations.\nDiminished access to water may adversely affect our operations or the operations of our customers.\nThe mining and processing activities in which we engage at a number of our facilities require significant amounts of water, and some of our facilities are located in areas that are water-constrained. Additionally, the development of oil and gas properties through fracture stimulation likewise requires significant water use. We have obtained water rights that we currently use to service the activities on our various properties, and we plan to obtain all required water rights to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that we and our customers are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we and our customers may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights.\nThese new regulations, which could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs and effectiveness if implemented. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we and our customers do business, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTitle to our mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to our production of sand may be disputed.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to our production of sand, may be disputed. Even though we obtain title guarantees on properties that we purchase, a successful claim that we lack appropriate mineral and water rights on one or more of our properties could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop and operate mines on that property. Any decrease or disruption in our mineral rights may adversely affect our operations. In some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to our results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy includes supplementing internal growth by pursuing acquisitions. Any acquisition may involve potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe validity of our assumptions about mineral reserves and future production, sales, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nthe use of a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions and the subsequent decrease in our liquidity;\n\u2022\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel both to manage and to operate our growing business and assets;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation, or restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas;\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses, and other information used when deciding to acquire a property, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations.\nIf we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe will be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, develop and increase our asset base. The inability to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nAlthough we currently use a significant amount of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations to fund the maintenance and development of our existing mineral reserves and production capacity and our acquisitions of new mineral reserves and production capacity, we may depend on the availability of credit to fund future capital expenditures and capital leases. Our ability to obtain financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, the covenants contained in our existing credit facility, term loans or future debt agreements, adverse market conditions or other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds necessary to maintain, develop, and increase our asset base, including our substantial railcar fleet, could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nEven if we are able to obtain financing or access the capital markets, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and our level of indebtedness could restrict our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities.\nOur asset-based revolving credit facility and term loans contain affirmative and negative covenants and substantial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur revolving credit facility and term loans contain, and any future financing agreements that we may enter into will likely contain operating and financial restrictions and covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand, or pursue our business activities.\nOur revolving credit agreement has availability based on a defined borrowing base, which is a percentage of accounts receivable and inventory. A decline in or restrictions of our borrowing base could result in our ability to draw additional amounts on the revolving credit facility, as well as trigger repayments of existing revolver borrowings.\nIf we violate any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, our obligations under our debt agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under these agreements, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nWe may have the need to incur substantial debt in the future to enable us to maintain or increase our production levels and to otherwise pursue our business plan. We may not be able to borrow funds successfully or, if we do, this debt may impair our ability to operate our business.\nA significant amount of capital expenditures would be required to grow our production capacity. If prices for the products we produce were to decline for an extended period of time, if the costs of our acquisition and development opportunities were to increase substantially or if other events were to occur which reduced our sales or increased our costs, we may be required to borrow in the future to enable us to finance the expenditures necessary to replace the reserves we extract. The cost of the borrowings and our obligations to repay the borrowings could have important consequences to us, because:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in future credit and debt arrangements may require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business, including possible acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nwe will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour debt level will make us more vulnerable than our less leveraged competitors to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient generate cash flows in order to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures; selling assets; restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness; or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all.\nInaccuracies in our estimates of mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.\nWe base our mineral reserve estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our engineers and geologists, which are reviewed by outside firms. However, sand reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of mineral reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable mineral reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future prices of sand-based products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs, and reclamation costs;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies; and\n\u2022\ndemand for product by grade.\nAny inaccuracy in our estimates related to our mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.\nMine closures entail substantial costs, and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies that we perform from time to time, but our studies and assumptions do not always prove to be accurate. If we close any of our mines sooner than expected, sales will decline unless we are able to increase production at any of our other mines, which may not be possible. The closure of an open pit mine also involves significant closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs, and the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds, roads, and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. If we were to reduce the estimated life of any of our mines, the fixed mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nApplicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, re-vegetation, and post-mining land use. In some cases, we are required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance\nequal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If our accruals for expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which we will be responsible were later determined to be insufficient, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nA shortage of skilled labor together with rising labor costs in the mining industry may further increase operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEfficient mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with several years of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks, including processing of mined minerals. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens or if we are unable to train the necessary number of skilled laborers, there could be an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production.\nOur production process consumes large amounts of natural gas and electricity. An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of these or any other significant raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nNatural gas is the primary fuel source used for drying sand in the production process and, as such, our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties. The price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, and environmental concerns. Furthermore, utility companies could enforce natural gas curtailments which affect our operations. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. In the past, the price of natural gas has been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the monthly closing price of natural gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange ranged from a high of $3.93 per million British Thermal Units (\u201cBTUs\u201d) to a low of $2.63 per million BTUs.\nPhenol is the primary component of the resins we buy, and our resin supply agreements contain market-based pricing provisions based on the cost of phenol. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for phenol.\nA significant increase in the price of phenol or of energy that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing industrial mineral properties, maximizing production from such properties, marketing industrial mineral production, and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. Further, we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our named executive officers. The loss of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, especially with the announced Merger with Unimin, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. In addition, due to the broad base of shares and options owned by our current employee base, a significant amount of readily-accessible wealth and liquidity may be generated in favorable market conditions. If any of our executives or other key employees were to retire as a result of this potential wealth creation, join a competitor, or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know-how, and key personnel. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success is dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ, and retain highly-skilled personnel.\nOur profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, various labor unions represented 16% of our domestic employees. The current collective bargaining agreements expire in 2019. If we are unable to renegotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with these labor unions in the future, we could experience, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns by our workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages, health care costs, or benefits paid to our employees. An inability to maintain good relations with our workforce could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSilica-related health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, or results of operations.\nThe inhalation of respirable crystalline silica can lead to the lung disease silicosis. There is disputed evidence of an association between respirable silica exposure and lung cancer as well as a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the silica industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of silica, may have the effect of discouraging our customers\u2019 use of our silica products. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing, and handling silica could materially and adversely affect silica producers, including us, through reduced use of silica products, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers, or reduced financing sources available to the silica industry. Further, any additional regulations that reduce the allowable silica exposure levels could materially and adversely affect the silica industry.\nWe and/or our predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of our customers alleging damages caused by silica exposure. As of December 31, 2017, we were subject to approximately six active silica exposure claims. Almost all of the claims pending against us arise out of the alleged use of our silica products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Texas, Mississippi, and Illinois, although cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years. In accordance with our insurance obligations, these claims are being defended by our subsidiaries\u2019 insurance carriers, subject to our payment of approximately 7% of the costs associated with these claims, which is not material. If the litigants prevail and our insurance coverage or indemnities prove to be insufficient or unavailable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nOur competitors may develop products or services that impede our ability to compete.\nOur ability to compete with competitors on a cost-effective or service basis may be limited if competitors develop products or services for customers that provide additional advantages over our own products or services. This includes, but is not limited to, a logistical \u201clast mile\u201d solution for delivering proppant to the well site.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our mining, processing and production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nThe performance, quality and safety of our products are critical to the success of our business. These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program, and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to the quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nSeasonal factors may impact our ability to process sand and our customers\u2019 demand for our products.\nBecause raw sand cannot be wet-processed during extremely cold temperatures, frac sand is typically washed only eight months out of the year at our surface mines in Wisconsin and our Minnesota and Ohio operations. Our inability to mine and process frac sand year round in these surface mines results in a seasonal build-up of inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a stockpile that will feed our drying facilities during the winter months.\nUnexpected winter weather conditions may result in our having an insufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our drying plants for the winter months and result in our being unable to satisfy customer requirements during these periods. As a result of these seasonal supply impacts, the cash flows of our North American operations can fluctuate if plant operations must remain shut down due to harsh winter weather conditions.\nIn addition to supply considerations, severe weather conditions may curtail our customers\u2019 drilling activities and impair rail shipment and transportation services and, as a result, our sales volumes to customers may similarly be adversely affected. Unexpected winter weather conditions may compound these seasonal impacts, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches, or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nOur international operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business abroad.\nWe conduct business in many parts of the world, including Argentina, Mexico, China, and northern Europe. Our ability to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents and business partners, and supervise, train, and retain competent employees. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of the FCPA by us or any of our employees.\nIn addition, our international operations are subject to the various laws and regulations of those respective countries as well as various risks peculiar to each country, which may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical actions and requirements of national governments including trade restrictions, embargoes, seizure, detention, nationalization, and expropriations of assets;\n\u2022\ninterpretation of tax statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide, routine examination by taxing authorities, and assessment of additional taxes, penalties, and/or interest;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism;\n\u2022\ndevaluations and other fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe impact of inflation; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of the local currency requirements.\nSignificant impairment losses related to goodwill, intangibles, and other assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe assess the impairment of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets at least annually and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. In 2015, we recorded an impairment of goodwill in our Proppant Solutions segment of $69.2 million. We assess impairment of our intangible assets when circumstances indicate the recoverability of the asset group or individual assets within the asset group may be impaired. In 2016, we recorded impairment of assets in our Proppant Solutions segment of $59.8 million as well as impairment of corporate assets of $33.3 million. We did not record any impairment of assets in 2017. Any significant impairment of goodwill, intangibles, or other assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries in which we operate could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our products and services. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Mining, and Other Regulation\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our customers, which could cause a decline in the demand for our sand-based proppants and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe supply proppants to oilfield service companies. Hydraulic fracturing is a widely used industry production technique that is used to recover natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals, under pressure, into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities. However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has become controversial in some areas and is undergoing increased scrutiny. Several federal agencies, regulatory authorities, and legislative entities are investigating the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and whether additional regulation may be necessary. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has asserted limited federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has indicated it may seek to further expand its regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management has proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal and Indian oil and gas leases. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, various state, local and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. For example, many states - including the major oil and gas producing states of North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia - have imposed disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing well owners and operators. Some local governments have adopted and others may seek to adopt ordinances prohibiting or regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions.\nAlthough we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing, the adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and gas wells, increase our customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our sand-based proppants. In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices, including nuisance lawsuits, could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our sand-based proppants, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulatory environmental requirements affecting the mining and mineral processing industry, including among others, those relating to employee health and safety,\nenvironmental permitting and licensing, air and water emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, waste management, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, hazardous materials, and natural resources. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA, or similar state and local laws, may be imposed as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Failure to properly handle, transport, store or dispose of hazardous materials or otherwise conduct our operations in compliance with environmental laws could expose us to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs and civil or criminal liability associated with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property or natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our mineral reserves or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Future events, including changes in any environmental requirements (or their interpretation or enforcement) and the costs associated with complying with such requirements, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nissuance of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndenial, modification, or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022\nimposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on our operations, including cessation of operations; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to perform site investigatory, remedial, or other corrective actions.\nMoreover, environmental requirements, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, greenhouse gas emission regulation is becoming more rigorous. We expect to be required to report annual greenhouse gas emissions from our operations to the EPA, and additional greenhouse gas emission related requirements at the supranational, federal, state, regional and local levels are in various stages of development. The U.S. Congress has considered, and may adopt in the future, various legislative proposals to address climate change, including a nationwide limit on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations, including the \u201cTailoring Rule,\u201d that subject greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such regulations could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase significantly our operating costs. Any regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including, for example, through a cap-and trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, reputation, operating performance, and product demand.\nIn addition to environmental regulation, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. For instance, in August 2013, OSHA proposed regulations that would reduce permissible exposure limits to 50 micrograms of respirable crystalline silica per cubic meter of air, averaged over an eight-hour day. Both the North American Industrial Mining Association and the National Industrial Sand Association, both of which we are a member, track silicosis related issues and aim to work with government policymakers in crafting such regulations.\nWe may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our operations or equipment or shut down some or all of our plants. Additionally, our customers may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our customers\nby requiring them to shut down old plants or to relocate plants to locations with less stringent regulations farther away from our facilities. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate our costs of compliance or the timing of any costs associated with any new laws and regulations, or any material adverse effect that any new standards will have on our customers and, consequently, on our operations.\nWe are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment, and other matters. Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including licensing, plant and wildlife protection, and reclamation regulation, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to the regulatory matters described above, we and our customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed. Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity of our mineral reserves and our ability to extract these reserves profitably, and our customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.\nIn order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the impact that any proposed exploration or production activities, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the environment. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition, including nuisance lawsuits, and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit essential to our operations or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the environment, or the identification of certain species as \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cendangered\u201d could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our ability to extract mineral reserves), our cost structure or our customers\u2019 ability to use our sand-based proppants. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to restore property in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved reclamation plan after it has been mined. We are required under federal, state and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The inability to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state and local laws, could subject us to fines and penalties as well as the revocation of our operating permits. Such inability could result from a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability, higher expense, or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;\n\u2022\nthe ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe exercise by financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew necessary financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership among our largest stockholders and their affiliates could limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the AS Group (\u201cAmerican Securities\u201d) indirectly owned approximately 44.1% of our outstanding common stock. In December 2016, American Securities sold 23 million shares, or 22.6% of our common stock, in a secondary public offering. As a result of the transaction, American Securities indirectly owns approximately 21.5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017. Our management, directors, and other employees own a significant portion of our stock. As a result, the portion of our stock held by the balance of the investing public taken as a whole is approximately 47.6% as of March 9, 2018. Consequently, our management and employees will continue to have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view as beneficial.\nFurthermore, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and American Securities and its affiliates, including its portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. American Securities is a private equity firm in the business of making investments in entities in a variety of industries. As a result, American Securities\u2019 existing and future portfolio companies which it controls may compete with us for investment or business opportunities. These conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur stock price could be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of your common stock at or above the price you paid.\nBroad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchased the stock. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to the risks described in this section, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as revenues, EBITDA, net income, and net income per share;\n\u2022\nactions taken by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet revenue or earnings estimates by research analysts or other investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nthe failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, the selling stockholders, or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations, or standards;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices, sand-based proppants, or industrial and recreational sand-based products;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully complete the merger with Unimin; and\n\u2022\nthe realization of any risks described under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us and American Securities. Under these provisions, neither American Securities, its affiliates and subsidiaries, nor any of their officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, or partners will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate, other than opportunities related to hydraulic fracturing proppants. For instance, a director of our company who also serves as a director, officer or employee of American Securities or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may pursue certain acquisitions or other opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition or other opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by American Securities to itself or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our Board elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and\namended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nadvance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the Board to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding that the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\ngiving the Board the power to authorize the issuance of one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions; and\n\u2022\nproviding that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder actions involving the Company.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and our debt agreements place certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our existing revolving credit facility and our term loan both place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, unless we revise our dividend policy, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common stock at a price greater than you paid for it.\nFuture sales of our common stock by significant shareholders, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. As of March 9, 2018, we had 224,630,307 shares of common stock outstanding. A substantial number of these shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. However, any shares of our common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, will be considered restricted or control shares under the Securities Act. Restricted or control shares may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. If a large number of these shares are sold on the open market, the price of our common stock could decline.\nIn the future, we may also issue securities if we need to raise capital in connection with a capital raise, acquisition, or to meet our debt obligations. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with a capital raise or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding shares of common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nRisks related to the Merger with Unimin\nThe announcement of the Merger with Unimin could adversely affect our business, financial results, and/or operations.\nThe announcement of the Merger could cause disruptions and create uncertainty surrounding our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel if this transaction is consummated, and could cause suppliers, customers, and other counterparties to change existing business relationships. Changes to existing business relationships, including termination or modification of contractual or other agreements, could negatively affect our revenues, earnings, and cash flow, as well as the market price of our common stock.\nWe are also subject to restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the transaction as provided in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness or expenditures, paying certain dividends, repurchasing or issuing securities and taking other specified actions without the consent of the other party until the earlier of the closing of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement. These restrictions could prevent or delay the pursuit of strategic corporate or business opportunities, could result in our ability to respond effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures, industry developments, developments relating to our customers and suppliers, and future opportunities, and may as a result or otherwise have a significant negative impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, management and financial resources have been diverted and will continue to be diverted towards the completion of the Merger. We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs, expense, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nWe may not complete the Merger within the timeframe we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results, and/or operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will occur. Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, and an affirmative stockholder vote. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will be satisfied and, if all required approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions, and timing of such approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to approve the Merger, our ongoing business may be adversely affected. Our business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the Merger, by the failure to obtain the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger, by payment of certain costs relating to the Merger (whether or not the Merger is completed), by the focus of our management on the Merger for an extended period of time rather than on normal business operations or opportunities or by the loss of certain senior managers and other key personnel by us as a consequence of the Merger not completing. We could experience negative reactions from our customers, regulators, and employees. In addition, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, and the market price of our common stock might decline as a result of any such failures to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. Any of these factors, among others, could have a material impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and if our Board seeks another merger, business combination, or other transaction, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration our stockholders would receive in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Unimin, or Unimin may be required to pay us, a termination fee of $52 million, depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. We also may be negatively impacted if we become subject to litigation related to entering into or failing to consummate the Merger.\nEven if the Merger is consummated, the anticipated benefits to stockholders may not be realized.\nThe success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, the combined company\u2019s ability to combine our business with that of Unimin in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and meets or exceeds the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends anticipated by each company. On a combined basis, the combined company expects to benefit from significant synergies, including integrating and optimizing our supply chain with that of Unimin in order to reduce logistics costs, decease cycles times of the companies\u2019 combined rail fleet and optimize the combined company\u2019s footprint. In the longer term, the combined company will evaluate applying our coating technologies to other minerals and applications in markets Unimin serves, advancing both companies\u2019 collective dust control technologies, growing our blending businesses across Unimin\u2019s assets and geographies and leveraging the best operational and commercial excellence programs of each company across the combined business. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, or the cost to achieve these synergies is greater than expected, then the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger and the integration of our business with Unimin\u2019s business.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in connection with the Merger and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of coordinating our business and that of Unimin after completion of the Merger. The parties cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the coordination of the two businesses after the completion of the Merger will offset the transaction and coordination costs in the near term or at all.\nThere are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies, and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Merger. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount of, or the timing of, anticipated expenses with respect to integration and implementation of the combined businesses.\nThere also may be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Merger that the combined company may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional income we expect to achieve from the Merger. Although we expect that the benefits of the Merger will offset the transaction expenses and integration costs over time, no assurance can be given that any benefits will be achieved in the near term, if at all.\nFurther, even if the Merger is not completed, we will need to pay certain pre-tax costs relating to the Merger incurred prior to the date the Merger was abandoned, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees, reorganization and restructuring costs, employee-benefit related expenses, and other related charges. Additionally, if the Merger is not completed within the expected timeframe, such delay may materially adversely affect the benefits we may achieve as a result of the Merger and could result in additional pre-tax transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Merger. Satisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the Merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, we expect.\nCombining our business with that of Unimin may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s results of operations and negatively affect the value of the combined company common stock following the Merger.\nWe have entered into the Merger Agreement with Unimin because we believe that the Merger will be beneficial to our respective companies and stockholders and that combining our business with that of Unimin will produce cost synergies and other benefits. However, Unimin and we have historically operated as independent companies and will continue to do so until the closing of the Merger. Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company\u2019s management will need to integrate Unimin\u2019s and our respective businesses. The combination of two independent businesses of our size of and scale is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process and the management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, some of which may be beyond their control including, without limitation:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving, in a timely manner, anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a larger combined company, addressing differences in historical business culture, and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating Unimin\u2019s business practices as a private company into that of a public company and building a public company infrastructure of the combined company;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our respective management teams\u2019 attention from ongoing business operations as a result of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of incorrect assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022\nunanticipated difficulties in integrating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems (including those provided by third-party service providers), procedures and policies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nunforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the Merger or our business;\n\u2022\nany potential deterioration of credit ratings resulting from the Merger;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nmanaging tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company;\n\u2022\ncombining separate organizations located in different regions of the country; and\n\u2022\nany other unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger.\nSome of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs or decreased revenue, which could materially impact the combined company\u2019s business, financial conditions, and results of operations, as well as increase the risk of operational errors due to management teams being diverted from ongoing business concerns, which could have negative reputational or regulatory impacts. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Merger may also adversely affect the combined company\u2019s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors, and other with whom we have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating our business with that of Unimin could harm the reputation of the combined company.\nIf the combined company is not able to combine our business with that of Unimin successfully in an efficient, cost-effective, and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of the combined company common stock or the revenue, levels of expenses, and results of operations of the combined company may be affected adversely. If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, the combined company may be unable to successfully realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nFurther, while either party can, in general, refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) affecting the other party prior to the completion of the Merger, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such changes would have a material adverse effect on us. If adverse changes occur but we must still complete the Merger, the market price of the combined company common stock may suffer.\nWe may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity related to the Merger and in connection with other matters.\nFrom time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with the Merger and in connection with other matters could result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Unimin and us. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, also may result in investigations by regulators, legislators, and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of Unimin\u2019s and our respective businesses. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement, or other legal proceedings is time-consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on our reputation, on the morale and performance of our employees, and on our relationships with our regulators. It also may have a negative impact on our ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential alternative acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire us.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to us during the pendency of the Merger. In particular, the Merger Agreement includes a general prohibition on soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition or combination proposal or offers for competing transactions, subject to limited exceptions. While our Board may withdraw or change its recommendation regarding the Merger Agreement in response to an unsolicited third-party proposal to acquire us that our Board determines to be superior to the Merger with Unimin, there are restrictions on our Board\u2019s ability to do so. Further, even if our Board withdraws its approval or recommendation of the Merger, we will still be required to submit the Merger proposal to a vote of our stockholders at a special meeting unless the Merger Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. In addition, we may be required to pay Unimin a termination fee of $52 million in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer from considering or proposing an alternative acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the proposed to be paid in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another strategic transaction, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nFollowing the closing of the Merger, any inability to access the debt capital markets could impair the combined company\u2019s liquidity, business, or financial condition.\nAny limitation on the ability of the combined company to raise money in the debt markets could have a substantial negative effect on the combined company\u2019s liquidity. The combined company\u2019s access to the debt markets in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a result of various factors, some of which are not specific to the combined company, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and interest rate fluctuations.\nThe costs and availability of financing from the debt capital markets also will be dependent on the creditworthiness of the combined company. The level and quality of the combined company\u2019s earnings, operations, business, and management, among other things, will impact its creditworthiness and potentially any credit ratings assigned by rating agencies to the combined company. A decrease in credit ratings assigned to the combined company by the ratings agencies may, to the extent that the combined company wishes to secure further borrowing, negatively impact the combined company\u2019s access to the debt capital markets and increase the combined company\u2019s cost of borrowing. It may also impact investor confidence in the combined company and consequently cause a decline in the price of the combined company common stock. There can be no assurance that the combined company will have a credit rating assigned to it by rating agency or maintain any specific credit rating on a stand-alone basis. Any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the combined company.\nOur current stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over management of, the combined company after the Merger than they did with respect to Fairmount Santrol prior to the Merger.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of our Board and on other matters affecting us that are subject to a vote of stockholders. Upon the closing of the Merger, each Fairmount Santrol stockholder who receives combined company common stock in the Merger will become a combined company stockholder with a percentage ownership of, and voting interest in, the combined company that is smaller than such stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership of, and voting interest in, us immediately prior to the Merger. Immediately following the closing of the Merger, our stockholders, as a group, will own 35% of the combined company. In addition, our former directors will constitute less than half of the combined company\u2019s board of directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on our management and policies.\nSibelco will exercise significant influence over the combined company, and its interests in the combined company may be different than yours.\nUpon the completion of the proposed Merger, Sibelco will beneficially own approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of combined company common stock. In addition, pursuant to a Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco will have certain preemptive rights pursuant to which it will be able to purchase its pro rata portion of any new securities that the combined company may from time to time propose to issue or sell to any person, with certain exceptions. Accordingly, subject to applicable law and the limitations set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco will be able to exercise significant influence over the combined company\u2019s business policies and affairs, including any action requiring the approval of the combined company\u2019s stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the combined company\u2019s assets.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco will have the right to nominate the majority of the initial directors of the combined company. Subject to the limitations included in the Stockholders Agreement, the directors designated by Sibelco will have significant authority to effect decisions affecting the capital structure of the combined company, including the issuance of additional capital stock, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends.\nThe interests of Sibelco may conflict with the interests of other combined company stockholders. For example, Sibelco may support certain long-term strategies or objectives for the combined company that may not be accretive to combined company stockholders in the short term. The concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of the combined company, even if such a change in control would benefit the other combined company stockholders and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Sibelco. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for the combined company common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with stockholders who own significant percentages of a company\u2019s outstanding stock.\nThe combined company will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and, as a result, will qualify for, and intends to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nIn addition to the consequences of the concentration of share ownership and possible conflicts between the interests of Sibelco and your interests discussed above, the combined company will initially be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company in which over 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and is not required to have:\n\u2022\na majority of its board of directors be independent directors;\n\u2022\na nominating and corporate governance committee or a compensation committee, or to have such committees be composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe compensation of the chief executive officer be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee comprised of independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on the board of directors.\nFollowing the proposed Merger, the combined company intends to rely on certain of these exemptions. In particular, a majority of the combined company\u2019s directors will not be independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE without regard to the exemptions available for \u201ccontrolled companies,\u201d and the combined company\u2019s initial status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may adversely affect the trading price for the combined company common stock.\nUpon the completion of the Merger, the combined company will become a public reporting company subject to financial reporting and other requirements.\nUpon the completion of the proposed Merger, as a public company, the combined company will become subject to reporting, disclosure control and other obligations under the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the NYSE. The combined company\u2019s management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. As a result, the combined company may incur higher legal, accounting and other expenses than before, and these expenses may increase even more in the future. For example, subject to certain exceptions, Section 404 of SOX requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and a report by the combined company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. If the combined company is unable to implement its compliance initiatives in a timely and effective fashion, its ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired.\nIn addition, the combined company cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit the combined company\u2019s ability to accurately report its cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. If the combined company is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm determines that the combined company has a material weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting, the combined company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, the market price of its common stock could decline, and the combined company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the combined company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict its future access to the capital markets and reduce or eliminate the trading market for the combined company common stock.", "PERMNO": 14961, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "FMSA"}
