{"cik": "857737", "company": "ICONIX BRAND GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could impact our operations. The following highlights some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations:\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND DEBT\nSubstantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs described in Note 1 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements, our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding the Company. This means there is substantial doubt we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have experienced substantial and recurring losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of $429.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Net losses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $(101.9) million and $(89.7) million, respectively. While we have positive cash flows from operations in recent periods, the potential adverse impact of the novel coronavirus on our operating results, liquidity and financial condition raise substantial doubt we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months.\nThe substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may negatively affect the price of our common stock, have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, including our licensees and employees, and make it challenging for us to issue additional debt to the extent needed. Our ability to successfully raise additional funds is uncertain and subject to market conditions generally, the market for our common stock and other risks. There can be no assurances as to the availability or terms upon which capital might be available, if needed. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to meet our financial obligations, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or cease our operations or otherwise impede our ongoing business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and long-term prospects, and investors may lose their entire investment in the Company. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash in the next twelve months necessary to fund continue operations.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund future operations will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including fees payable in connection with waivers obtained from our creditors and lenders, costs related to the impairment analysis discussed below and costs related to ongoing litigation (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and the risk factor entitled\u201d-We have also been named in securities litigations, which could be expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention. There may be additional class action and/or derivative claims\u201d). As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity, obtain additional equity or debt financing, sell existing assets or enter into strategic alliances with other parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow, refinance our indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our financial condition and could cause us to be unable to service our existing debt. If we are unable to obtain a waiver, we would be in default under our existing indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Even if we are able to obtain such waivers, limited liquidity may cause us to delay or abandon some or all of our plans to invest in new brands and may have a material and adverse effect our ability to generate and/or increase revenue going forward or cause us to be unable to maintain existing licenses on favorable terms and conditions. Additionally, we have historically received cash payments of management fees and residual fees under the agreements governing our Senior Secured Notes (as defined below). However, there is no guarantee we will receive any or all of these amounts in future years. Any decrease in cash received under these arrangements in future periods could adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and in the event we are unable to meet our debt obligations we could lose title to certain trademarks.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet reflects debt of approximately $645.7 million (which is net of $15.3 million of debt issuance costs and original issue discount), including (i) securitization debt of $437.1 million (net of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $1.1 million) under our Series 2012-1 4.229% Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2, Series 2013-1 4.352% Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (collectively, the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d), and the Variable Funding Notes (as defined below), (ii) senior secured debt of $161.3 million (net of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $14.2 million) under our Senior Secured Term Loan (as defined below), and (iii) subordinated secured debt of $94.4 million (which is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 at a fair value of $47.3 million) under our 5.75% convertible senior subordinated secured second lien notes due 2023 (the \u201c5.75% Convertible Notes\u201d). We may also assume or incur additional debt, including secured debt, in the future in connection with, or to fund, future acquisitions or refinance our existing debt obligations. Our outstanding debt obligations:\n\u2022\ncould impair our liquidity;\n\u2022\ncould make it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its other obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt obligations, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\ncould impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on us with respect to the use of our available cash;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects and could limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our licensing markets; and\n\u2022\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors who have less debt and/or less leverage.\nIn the event that we fail to make any required payment under any current or future agreements governing our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in those agreements, we would be in default regarding that indebtedness. A debt default could significantly diminish the market value and marketability of our common stock, result in the acceleration of the payment obligations under all or a portion of our consolidated indebtedness and impact the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe terms of our debt agreements have restrictive covenants and our failure to comply with any of these could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects, and could cause us to lose title to our key IP assets.\nUnless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitization debt, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings. The securitization debt, under which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (as defined below, the \u201cCo-Issuers\u201d) issued and guaranteed the Senior Secured Notes and a revolving financing facility consisting of variable funding notes, herein referred to as Variable Funding Notes, contain a number of covenants, with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation. These covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay distributions on their equity interests;\n\u2022\nincur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees; and\n\u2022\nincur liens.\nThese restrictions could reduce our liquidity and thereby affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. The securitization debt requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio relating to available cash to service the borrowings at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy such a test. A breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitization debt.\nIn the event that a rapid amortization event occurs or continues under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitization debt at the end of the five year interest-only period), the funds available to us would be or are reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.\nFurthermore, a reserve account has been established for the benefit of the secured parties under the indenture for the purpose of trapping cash upon the occurrence of our failure to maintain a specified financial ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Once it commences, such cash trapping period would extend until the quarterly payment date on which that financial ratio becomes equal to or exceeds the minimum ratio. In the event that a cash trapping period commences, the funds available for the Co-Issuers to pay amounts to us will be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to support our business and service repayment obligations under our other financing arrangements (including under the Senior Secured Term Loan and 5.75% Convertible Notes).\nIn an event of default, all unpaid amounts under the Senior Secured Notes and Variable Funding Notes could become immediately due and payable at the direction or consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes. Such acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we are unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with our lenders or if alternate funding is not available to us.\nFurthermore, if amounts owed under the securitization debt were to become accelerated because of a failure to meet the specified financial ratio or to make required payments, the holders of our Senior Secured Notes would have the right to foreclose on the Candie\u2019s, Bongo, Joe Boxer, Rampage, Mudd, London Fog, Mossimo, Ocean Pacific/OP, Danskin/Danskin Now, Rocawear, Cannon, Fieldcrest, Royal Velvet, Charisma, Starter and Waverly trademarks in the United States and Canada (with the exception of the London Fog brand for outerwear in the United States); on our joint venture interests in Hardy Way, MG Icon and ZY Holdings; on the equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries; and on other related assets securing the notes.\nThe Senior Secured Term Loan and the indenture in respect of our 5.75% Convertible Notes (the \u201c5.75% Notes Indenture\u201d) also contain a number of covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, their respective subsidiaries and certain joint ventures to, among other things:\n\u2022\ngrant liens on certain assets;\n\u2022\nconsummate specified types of acquisitions or acquisitions requiring cash consideration in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\nmake fundamental changes (including mergers and consolidations);\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments and investments; and\n\u2022\nincur or prepay certain indebtedness.\nIn addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary IBG Borrower LLC (\u201cIBG Borrower\u201d), as borrower under the Senior Secured Term Loan, must maintain a specified minimum asset coverage ratio and leverage ratio.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Term Loan or a default under the 5.75% Notes Indenture, in addition to the interest rate increasing by an additional 3% per year under the Credit Agreement, all unpaid amounts under the Senior Secured Term Loan and the 5.75% Convertible Notes could become immediately due and payable. An acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were to be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with our lenders or holders of the 5.75% Convertible Notes or other debt obligations as they come due. In addition, a default under one debt instrument relating to our existing indebtedness could in turn permit lenders or holders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be due and payable pursuant to cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses.\nIn the event of a default under our indebtedness under our Senior Secured Term Loan, which is not waived by our lenders thereunder, such lenders may be able to declare all of the indebtedness under such facilities, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable.\nIn the event of a default under our indebtedness under our Senior Secured Term Loan, which is not waived by our lenders thereunder, such lenders generally would be able to declare all of the indebtedness under such facilities, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. In addition, borrowings under our Senior Secured Term Loan are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Guarantors defined therein. In the event of a default under that facility, such lenders generally would be entitled to seize the collateral, including assets which are necessary to operate our business.\nPursuant to the terms of the 5.75% Note Indenture, the 5.75% Convertible Notes are secured by a second-priority lien on all of the assets of the same Guarantors listed in the Senior Secured Term Loan. Subject to the terms of an Intercreditor Agreement governing the relationship between the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loan and the holders of the 5.75% Convertible Notes, in the event of a default under our Senior Secured Term Loan, the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loan generally would be entitled to seize the collateral, including assets which are necessary to operate our business. In addition, default under one debt instrument relating to our existing indebtedness could in turn permit lenders or holders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be due and payable pursuant to cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses. Moreover, upon the occurrence of an event of default relating to our indebtedness, any commitments to extend further credit to us could be terminated.\nAccordingly, the occurrence of a default under any debt instrument, unless cured or waived, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR.\nOur Senior Secured Term Loan uses LIBOR as a reference rate to determine the rate of interest payable on our borrowings. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the phase out of the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. To identify a successor rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, a U.S. based group convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was formed. Similarly, financial regulators in the UK, the European Union, Japan, and Switzerland formed working groups with the aim of recommending alternatives to LIBOR denominated in their local currencies. The ARRC is comprised of a diverse set of private-sector entities and a wide array of official-sector entities, banking regulators, and other financial sector regulators. The ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the U.S.\nAt this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to, or discontinuation of, LIBOR. If reference rates under our Senior Secured Term Loan are no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in reference rates, we may experience increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock, which has traded with significant volatility in the past year, may continue to be volatile, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has traded with significant volatility, and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility could further reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could change significantly over short periods of time in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, announcements by us, our licensees or our respective competitors, factors affecting our licensees\u2019 markets generally and/or changes in national or regional economic conditions, making it more difficult for shares of our common stock to be sold at a favorable price or at all. The market price of our common stock could also be reduced by general market price declines or market volatility in the future or future declines or volatility in the prices of stocks for companies in the trademark licensing business or companies in the industries in which our licensees compete. In addition, any future conversions of the 5.75% Convertible Notes would dilute the holdings of our then existing stockholders, including any remaining holders of our 5.75% Convertible Notes that receive shares of our common stock upon conversion of their notes, and could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of our common stock may cause the prevailing market price of our shares to decrease.\nWe have issued a substantial number of shares of common stock that are eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and that may become freely tradable. We may, in the future, issue additional shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of our 5.75% Convertible Notes, we may elect to pay interest on such notes in shares of our common stock, rather than in cash. Upon conversion of our 5.75% Convertible Notes, we may elect to satisfy our conversion obligations solely in shares of our common stock, which would result in an increase in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock that, subject to certain limitations, would be freely tradable. We have also issued a substantial number of restricted shares of common stock as inducement grants in connection with the Company\u2019s hiring of a new CEO in October 2018 and a new CFO in February 2019 and may do so again in the future. If the holders of 5.75% Convertible Notes choose to exercise their conversion rights and sell the underlying shares of common stock in the public market, or if holders of currently restricted shares of our common stock choose to sell such shares in the public market under Rule 144 or otherwise, the prevailing market price for our common stock may decline. The sale of shares issued upon the exercise of our derivative securities or other issuances of our common stock could also further dilute the holdings of our then existing stockholders, including holders of convertible notes that receive shares of our common stock upon conversion of their notes. In addition, future issuances of shares of our common stock could impair our ability to raise capital by offering equity securities.\nFuture issuances of equity or convertible notes to raise additional needed capital may result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nIn order to raise additional needed capital, the Company may issue shares of its common stock or shares of preferred stock or debt convertible into shares of its common stock or preferred stock. There can be no assurance that such issuances will be at current market rates or on terms favorable to the Company and its existing stockholders. Any raising of capital involving the issuance of equity is expected to result in a significant dilution to existing stockholders. The terms of any debt securities issued could also impose significant restrictions on our operations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and may adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds.\nWe have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and during the course of preparing our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of this material weakness is not effective, we may be unable to report our financial condition or results of operations accurately or on a timely basis and investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs previously disclosed, we and our auditors have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for prior periods. Following the identification of the material weaknesses for prior periods, management implemented a remediation plan for such material weaknesses. Although such material weaknesses have been remediated, there can be no assurance that the internal controls we implement will be effective or that in the future we will not suffer from additional ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting, which would further impair our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports.\nMoreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to remediate effectively these material weaknesses, we may be unable to report our financial condition or financial results accurately or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC, and our business may be further harmed. Historical restated financial statements and failures in internal controls may also cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting process and the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the short term.\nAn investor should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income in the short term, as we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing licensing operations, further develop our trademarks and finance the acquisition of additional trademarks. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe failure of our licensees to adequately produce, market, import and sell products bearing our brand names in their license categories, continue their operations, renew their license agreements or pay their obligations under their license agreements could result in a decline in our results of operations.\nOur revenue is almost entirely dependent on royalty payments made to us under our license agreements. Although the license agreements for our brands usually require the advance payment to us of a portion of the license fees and, in most cases, provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees to satisfy their obligations under these agreements, or their inability to operate successfully or at all, could result in their breach and/or the early termination of such agreements, their non-renewal of such agreements or our decision to amend such agreements to reduce the guaranteed minimums or sales royalties due thereunder, thereby eliminating some or all of that stream of revenue. There can be no assurances that we will not lose the licensees under our license agreements due to their failure to exercise the option to renew or extend the term of those agreements or the cessation of their business operations (as a result of their financial difficulties or otherwise) without equivalent options for replacement. Any of such failures could reduce the anticipated revenue stream to be generated by the license agreements. In addition, the failure of our licensees to meet their production, manufacturing and distribution requirements, or to be able to continue to import goods (including, without limitation, as a result of changes to laws or trade regulations, trade embargoes, labor strikes or unrest, especially, for example, given the recent uncertainty around tariffs in respect of trade between the US and China and the US and European Union), could cause a decline in their sales and potentially decrease the amount of royalty payments (over and above the guaranteed minimums) due to us. Also, the recent global Coronavirus outbreak has the potential to cause a disruption in production, manufacturing, distribution and sales globally, which could have a material negative impact on royalty payments made to us under our license agreements. Further, the failure of our licensees and/or their third party manufacturers, which we do not control, to adhere to\nlocal laws, industry standards and practices generally accepted in the United States in areas of worker safety, worker rights of association, social compliance, and general health and welfare, could result in accidents and practices that cause disruptions or delays in production and/or substantial harm to the reputation of our brands, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. A weak economy or softness in certain sectors including apparel, consumer products, retail and entertainment could exacerbate this risk. This, in turn, could decrease our potential revenues and cash flows.\nA substantial portion of our licensing revenue is concentrated with a limited number of licensees, such that the loss of any of such licensees or their renewal on terms less favorable than today, could slow our growth plans, decrease our revenue and impair our cash flows.\nOur licenses with, Centric Brands Inc. and Kohl\u2019s, represent, each in the aggregate, our two largest licensees during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, representing approximately 12% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenue for such period.\nBecause we are dependent on these licensees for a significant portion of our licensing revenue, if any of them were to have financial difficulties affecting their ability to make payments, cease operations, or if any of these licensees decides not to renew or extend any existing agreement with us, or to significantly reduce its sales of licensed products under any of the agreement(s), our revenue and cash flows could be reduced substantially.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company was notified of the following non-renewals of license agreements: (i) the Candie\u2019s and Mudd license at Kohl\u2019s, (ii) the Danskin Now DTR license agreements with Walmart, (iii) the Royal Velvet license agreement with J.C. Penney\u2019s, (iv) the Mossimo DTR license agreement with Target and (v) the Material Girl DTR license agreement with Macy\u2019s. While the Company is actively working to place these brands with other licensees, the failure to enter into replacement license agreements for these brands on economic terms similar to such DTR arrangements may adversely affect our future revenues and cash flows.\nIn addition, we may face increasing competition in the future for DTR licenses as other companies owning established brands may decide to enter into licensing arrangements with retailers similar to those we currently have in place. Furthermore, our current or potential DTR licensees may decide to more prominently promote and market competing brands, or develop or purchase other or establish their own brands, rather than continue their licensing arrangements with us. In addition, increased competition could result in lower sales of products offered by our DTR licensees under our brands. If our competition for retail licenses increases, it may take us longer to procure additional retail licenses.\nWe have a material amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, including our trademarks, recorded on our balance sheet. As a result of changes in market conditions and declines in the estimated fair value of these assets, we may, in the future, be required to further write down a portion of this goodwill and other intangible assets and such write-down would, as applicable, either decrease our net income or increase our net loss.\nAs of December 31, 2019, goodwill represented approximately $26.1 million, or approximately 5% of the Company\u2019s total consolidated assets, and trademarks and other intangible assets represented approximately $274.1 million, or approximately 54% of our total consolidated assets. Under current U.S. GAAP accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, including most of our trademarks, are no longer amortized, but instead are subject to impairment evaluation based on related estimated fair values, with such testing to be done at least annually.\nIn FY 2019 and FY 2018, as a result of a decline in net sales as well as a decline in future guaranteed minimum royalties from license agreements for certain brands, the Company recorded non-cash asset impairment charges, related to the write-off of certain of our trademarks of $65.6 million and $136.4 million, respectively. In FY 2018 the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to write-off goodwill, in the amount of $37.8 million.\nThere can be no assurance that any future downturn in the business of any of the Company\u2019s segments, or a continued decrease in our market capitalization, will not result in a further write-down of goodwill or trademarks, which would either decrease the Company\u2019s net income or increase the Company\u2019s net loss, which may or may not have a material impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations.\nAs a result of the intense competition within our licensees\u2019 markets and the strength of some of their competitors, we and our licensees may not be able to continue to compete successfully.\nMany of our trademark licenses are for products in the apparel, fashion accessories, footwear, beauty and fragrance, home products and d\u00e9cor industries in which our licensees face intense competition, including from our other brands and licensees, as well as from third party brands and licensees. In general, competitive factors include quality, price, style, name recognition and service. In addition, various fads and the limited availability of shelf space could affect competition for our licensees\u2019 products. Many of our licensees\u2019 competitors have greater financial, importation, distribution, marketing and other resources than our licensees and have achieved significant name recognition for their brand names. Our licensees may be unable to compete successfully in the markets for their products, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to our licensing arrangements.\nOur business is dependent on continued market acceptance of our brands and the products of our licensees bearing these brands.\nAlthough most of our licensees guarantee minimum net sales and minimum royalties to us, a failure of our brands or of products bearing our brands to achieve or maintain market acceptance could cause a reduction of our licensing revenue and could further cause existing licensees not to renew their agreements. Such failure could also cause the devaluation of our trademarks, which are our primary IP assets, making it more difficult for us to renew our current licenses upon their expiration or enter into new or additional licenses for our trademarks. In addition, if such devaluation of our trademarks were to occur, a material impairment in the carrying value of one or more of our trademarks could also occur and be charged as an expense to our operating results.\nThe industries in which we compete, including the apparel industry, are subject to rapidly evolving trends and competition. In addition, consumer tastes change rapidly. The licensees under our licensing agreements may not be able to anticipate, gauge or respond to such changes in a timely manner. Failure of our licensees to anticipate, identify and capitalize on evolving trends could result in declining sales of our brands and devaluation of our trademarks. Continued and substantial marketing efforts, which may, from time to time, also include our expenditure of significant additional funds to keep pace with changing consumer demands, are required to maintain market acceptance of the licensees\u2019 products and to create market acceptance of new products and categories of products bearing our trademarks; however, these expenditures may not result in either increased market acceptance of, or licenses for, our trademarks or increased market acceptance, or sales, of our licensees\u2019 products. Furthermore, while we believe that we currently maintain sufficient control over the products our licensees\u2019 produce under our brand names through the provision of trend direction and our right to preview and approve a majority of such products, including their presentation and packaging, we do not actually design or manufacture products bearing our marks, and therefore, have more limited control over such products\u2019 quality and design than a traditional product manufacturer might have.\nOur success is largely dependent on the continued service of our key personnel.\nAs previously disclosed, we have experienced significant turnover in our senior management team. While we are not aware of any further pending changes in key management positions, we cannot provide assurance that we will effectively manage our current management transition or other future management changes we may experience. An inability to effectively manage these changes may impact our ability to retain our senior executives and other key employees, which could harm our operations. Additional turnover at the senior management level may create instability within the Company and our employees may terminate their employment, which could further impede our ability to maintain day to day operations. Such instability could also impede our ability to fully implement our business plan and growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or policies, or interpretations thereof. In addition, our current global tax structure could be negatively impacted by various factors, including changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions in which we earn income or changes in, or in the interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. An increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe also are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities both domestically (including state and local entities) and abroad. We regularly assess the likelihood of recovering the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations by various taxing authorities in order to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We cannot guarantee that the outcomes of these evaluations and continuous examinations will not harm our reported operating results and financial conditions.\nWe are subject to additional risks associated with our international licensees and joint ventures.\nWe market and license our brands outside the United States and many of our licensees are located, and joint ventures operate, outside the United States. As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales, including, without limitation, through joint ventures. We and our joint ventures face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including: (i) unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements; (ii) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes, sanctions and other trade barriers (including, for example, given the recent uncertainty around tariffs in respect of trade between the US and China and the US and European Union); (iii) competition from foreign companies; (iv) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (v) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our IP; (vi) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region (including, without limitation, as a result of political unrest), particularly in emerging markets; (vii) fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar and the cost of currency exchange; (viii) potentially adverse tax consequences; (ix) disruptions in supply chain continuity, including from natural disasters, global disease outbreaks such as the novel coronavirus, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control and (x) cultural differences in the conduct of business. Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales, or distributions from our international joint ventures, to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion. In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all other applicable anti-bribery laws, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.\nA portion of our revenue and net income are generated outside of the United States, by certain of our licensees and our joint ventures, in countries that may have volatile currencies, capital control regimes, legal prohibitions on enforcing payment terms in license agreements or other risks.\nA portion of our revenue is attributable to activities in territories and countries outside of the United States by certain of our joint ventures and our licensees. The fact that some of our revenue and certain business operations of our joint ventures and certain licensees are conducted outside of the United States exposes them to several additional risks, including, but not limited to social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or to laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment in the territories and countries where our joint ventures or certain licensees currently have operations or will in the future operate. Certain foreign jurisdictions also create difficulties collecting bad debts or other outstanding receivables owed to the Company or its joint ventures. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on the business and operations of our joint ventures and certain of our licensees operations, which could also adversely impact our results of operations. Increase of revenue generated in foreign markets may also increase our exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates and exposure to capital controls that trap cash in these foreign currencies and/or jurisdictions. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our joint ventures and licensees. In the past, we and our joint ventures have attempted to have contracts that relate to activities outside of the United States denominated in U.S. currency, however, we do not know to the extent that we will be able to continue this as we increase our contracts with foreign licensees. In certain instances we have entered into foreign currency hedges to mitigate our risk related to fluctuations in our contracts denominated in foreign currencies; however, we cannot predict the effect that future exchange rate fluctuations will have on our operating results. We also cannot guarantee that we can distribute cash out of these foreign jurisdictions or otherwise enforce all of our legal and economic rights therein. From time to time, particularly in countries with strong capital controls in place by a central bank or other centralized governmental monetary authority (e.g. the People\u2019s Republic of China, Brazil and Argentina), we have had difficulty from time to time distributing cash on a timely basis out of such countries. Similarly, in the past in certain foreign countries, we have faced difficulties in legally enforcing the payment terms in our license agreements or otherwise collecting past due payables due from certain licensees. A material rise in any of the aforementioned challenges, especially with respect to any unpaid material sums, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur licensees are subject to risks and uncertainties of foreign manufacturing and importation of goods, and the price, availability and quality of raw materials, along with labor unrest at shipping/receiving ports, could interrupt their operations or increase their operating costs, thereby affecting their ability to deliver goods to the market, reduce or delay their sales and decrease our potential royalty revenue.\nSubstantially all of the products sold by our licensees are manufactured overseas and there are substantial risks associated with foreign manufacturing and importation, including changes in laws and policies relating to quotas and current and proposed international trade agreements, the payment of tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays, labor unrest that could hinder or delay shipments, effects on the ability to import goods or the cost associated with such importation and international political, regulatory and economic developments. Further, our licensees may experience fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics and raw materials used by them in their manufactured or purchased finished goods. Any of these risks could increase our licensees\u2019 operating costs. Our licensees also import finished products and assume all risk of loss and damage with respect to these goods once they are shipped by their suppliers. If these goods are destroyed or damaged during shipment, the revenue of our licensees, and thus our royalty revenue over and above the guaranteed minimums, could be reduced as a result of our licensees\u2019 inability to deliver or their delay in delivering their products.\nWe participate in international joint ventures which we do not typically legally control.\nWe participate in a number of international joint ventures, some of which we do not control. As we continue to expand our business internationally and execute our strategy for growth, we may enter into additional International Joint Ventures in the future. Joint ventures pose an inherent risk. Regardless of whether we hold a majority interest in or directly control the management of our International Joint Ventures, our partners may have business goals and interests that are not aligned with ours, exercise their rights in a manner of which we do not approve, be unable to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture agreements, or exploit our trademarks in a manner that harms the overall quality and image of our brands. In addition, any of our joint venture partners may simply be unable to identify licensees for our brands. In these cases, the termination of an arrangement of one of our joint venture partners or their failure to build the business could result in the delay of our expansion in a particular market or markets, and will not allow us to achieve the worldwide growth that we seek on our current timeline. We may not be able to identify another suitable partner for a particular joint venture or foreign territory in such market or markets, which could result in further delay, and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, such as the novel coronavirus, or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme terrestrial or solar weather events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties that could impair our ability to manage our businesses.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. This coronavirus has since spread to other parts of the world, including South Korea, the United States and Europe, and efforts to contain the spread of this coronavirus have intensified. If this outbreak continues to spread, we or our licensees may need to limit operations regionally or globally. We are reliant upon the ongoing operations of our licensees to generate revenue and cash flow for our business, and a number of our licensees are unable to operate all or a portion of their retail sales points. Also, our selling partners may have limited or no access to manufacturing, production or distribution facilities as a result of regional or country-wide shutdowns of non-essential businesses. While the closures are expected to be temporary, the extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Also, if the spread of the coronavirus continues and our, or our licensees\u2019, operations are impacted, we may be subject to claims arising from force majeure under our existing license agreements. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could materially adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nA sale of our trademarks or other IP related to our brands in a jurisdiction could have a negative effect on the brands in other jurisdictions or worldwide.\nFrom time to time, we may sell IP related to our brands to a third party in a domestic or foreign territory, where we do not intend to continue exploiting the brand. In these instances, we may enter into co-existence agreements with any such third party, the terms of which require that the sold IP be exploited in a manner befitting the brand image and prestige. Though we try to limit our potential exposure related to potential misuse of the IP, we cannot ensure that third parties will comply with their contractual requirements or that they will use the IP in an appropriate manner. Any misuse by a third party of IP related to our brands could lead to a negative perception of our brands by current and potential licensees, international joint venture partners or consumers, and could adversely affect our ability to develop the brands and meet our strategic goals. This, in turn, could decrease our potential revenue.\nOur failure to protect our proprietary rights could compromise our competitive position and result in cancellation, loss of rights or diminution in value of our brands.\nWe monitor on an ongoing basis, unauthorized filings of our trademarks and imitations thereof, and rely primarily upon a combination of U.S., Canadian and other international federal, state and local laws, as well as contractual restrictions to protect and enforce our IP rights. We believe that such measures afford only limited protection and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish, protect and enforce our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent infringement of our IP rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused therefrom.\nFor instance, despite our efforts to protect and enforce our IP rights, unauthorized parties may misappropriate or attempt to copy aspects of our IP, which could harm the reputation of our brands, decrease their value and/or cause a decline in our licensees\u2019 sales and thus our revenue. Further, we and our licensees may not be able to detect infringement of our IP rights quickly or at all, and at times we or our licensees may not be successful combating counterfeit, infringing or knockoff products, thereby damaging our competitive position. In addition, we depend upon the laws of the countries where our licensees\u2019 products are sold to protect our IP. IP rights may be unavailable or limited in some countries because standards of register ability vary internationally. Consequently, in certain foreign jurisdictions, we have elected or may elect not to apply for trademark registrations. If we fail to timely file a trademark application in any such country, we may be precluded from obtaining a trademark registration in such country at a later date. Failure to adequately pursue and enforce our trademark rights could damage our brands, enable others to compete with our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively.\nIn addition, our license agreements provide our licensees with rights to our trademarks and contain provisions requiring our licensees to comply with certain standards to be monitored by us. Our failure to adequately monitor our licensees\u2019 compliance with the license agreements or take appropriate corrective action when necessary may subject our IP assets to cancellation, loss of rights or diminution in value.\nFurther, the rights to our brands in our International Joint Venture territories are controlled primarily through our joint ventures in these regions. While we believe that our partnerships in these areas will enable us to better protect our trademarks in the countries covered by the ventures, we do not control all of our joint venture companies and thus most decisions relating to the use and enforcement of the marks in these countries will be subject to the approval of our local partners.\nWe also own the exclusive right to use various domain names containing or relating to our brands. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent third parties from acquiring and maintaining domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our brands which could cause a decline in our licensees\u2019 sales and the related revenue and in turn decrease the amount of royalty payments (over and above the guaranteed minimums) due to us.\nThird-party claims regarding our intellectual property assets could result in our licensees being unable to continue using our trademarks, which could adversely impact our revenue or result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us or our licensees.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement or violation of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties or third parties may assert infringement claims against us and/or our licensees. To the extent that any of our intellectual property assets is deemed to violate the proprietary rights of others in any litigation or proceeding or as a result of any claim, then we and our licensees may be prevented from using it, which could cause a breach or termination of certain license agreements. If our licensees are prevented from using our trademarks, this could adversely impact the revenue of our licensees with respect to those IP assets, and thus the royalty payments over and above the guaranteed minimums could be reduced as a result of the licensees\u2019 inability to continue using our trademarks. Litigation could also result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us and our licensees. Further, if we, our International Joint Ventures or our licensees are alleged to have infringed the IP rights of another party, any resulting litigation could be costly and could damage the Company\u2019s reputation. There can be no assurance that we, our International Joint Ventures or our licensees would prevail in any litigation relating to our IP.\nWe may not be able to establish or maintain our trademark rights and registrations, which could impair our ability to perform our obligations under our license agreements, which could cause a decline in our licensees\u2019 sales and potentially decrease the amount of royalty payments (over and above the guaranteed minimums) due to us.\nWhile we intend to take reasonable steps to protect our trademark rights, it may not be possible to obtain or maintain legal protection and registrations for all of our trademarks for all forms of goods and services based on certain facts, such as the timing of our or our predecessors\u2019 entrance into the market or the fact that a third party previously adopted a similar mark for use in connection with a similar set of goods or services. As a result, it may be difficult or not possible for our trademarks to be registered or even protected so as to prohibit third party use in a particular manner. Moreover, third parties may challenge or seek to oppose or cancel existing trademark applications or registrations, and we cannot guarantee we will succeed against such challenges. Any failure to secure and maintain rights and registrations could impair our ability to perform our obligations under the license agreements, enter new product or service categories or could affect our ability to enter into new license agreements or renew existing license agreements, both of which could cause a decline in our licensees\u2019 sales and potentially decrease the amount of royalty payments (over and above the guaranteed minimums) due to us.\nWe are subject to local laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business. Our International Joint Ventures are subject to similar regulations in the countries where they operate. While we actively identify and monitor our obligations and the applicability of all laws to ensure that we are compliant and our contractual arrangements with our International Joint Venture partners require them to do the same, our efforts to maintain compliance with local laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenses, and our failure to comply with such laws may expose us to potential liability. In addition, our ability to operate or compete effectively, as well as our financial results, could be adversely affected by the introduction of new laws, policies or regulations; changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws, policies and regulations; or our failure to obtain required regulatory approvals.\nWe may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we may be made a party to litigation in the normal course of business. For example, as the owner of a trademark, we may be named as a defendant in a lawsuit relating to a product designed and manufactured by a licensee of that trademark. In most cases, our licensees under the existing license agreements are obligated to defend and indemnify us, as licensor, and our affiliates with respect to such litigation. In addition, while third parties could assert infringement claims involving our trademarks, we believe our trademarks are not subject to significant litigation risk because they are widely known and well-established trademarks, which have been consistently used by us and the previous owners. We also maintain insurance for certain risks, but it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all possible liabilities. Although historically the litigation involving us has not been material to our financial position or our liquidity, any litigation has an element of uncertainty and if any such litigation were to be adversely determined and/or a licensee were to fail to properly indemnify us and/or we did not have appropriate insurance coverage, such litigation could affect our financial position and liquidity.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate or available for us to avoid or limit our exposure in respect of pending actions or in future claims and adequate insurance coverage may not be available in sufficient amounts or at a reasonable cost in the future. Even in the event the Company is able to resolve outstanding disputes as they relate to the Company, the Company retains significant obligations to advance legal fees and costs related to the government investigations of certain of its current and former directors, officers and employees as either targets or witnesses for the government, and the amount of such fees and the duration of this liability will be difficult to predict.\nIn the past, we have been named in and settled securities litigations, which were expensive and diverted our management\u2019s time. Further, the Company received a formal order of investigation into certain accounting and reporting issues occurring during 2013 through the third quarter of 2015 from the SEC staff in December 2015 and was contacted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York in December 2018 regarding the same matters underlying the SEC\u2019s investigation (together, the \u201cGovernment Investigations\u201d). The Company has cooperated fully with the SEC and SDNY regarding this matter. As previously disclosed, on December 5, 2019, the Company reached an agreement with the SEC to resolve the SEC portion of the Investigation. As part of the settlement, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (\u201cSDNY\u201d), the Company agreed to pay a civil penalty of $5.5 million. On the same day, the U.S. Attorney for the SDNY unsealed charges against the Company\u2019s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as its former Chief Operating Officer (who subsequently plead guilty). The criminal trial in this matter is set to begin on May 11, 2020. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of its articles and bylaws, the Company is obligated to advance legal and other fees to its current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to the Governmental Investigations, which such amounts to date have been significant. As of the third quarter of 2019, as a result of the expenses related to such matters, the Company\u2019s insurance coverage related to such matters has been exhausted. As such, the Company will not be reimbursed for any further expenses incurred related to such matters, including by its former Chairman and CEO or certain of its current and former directors, officers and employees that may be witnesses in the afore-mentioned or any additional enforcement, investigatory or other legal actions taken by the SEC or SDNY in respect of such individuals.\nWhile we audit our licensees from time to time in the ordinary course, we otherwise rely on the accuracy of our licensees\u2019 retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenue could be delayed or inaccurately reported.\nMost of our revenue is generated from retailers that license our brands for manufacture and sale of products bearing our brands in their stores. Under our existing agreements, these licensees pay us licensing fees based in part on the retail value of products sold. We rely on our licensees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license fees, preparing our financial reports, projections, budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts. All of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees. If any of our licensee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.\nA decline in general economic conditions or an increase in inflation resulting in a decrease in consumer-spending levels and an inability to access capital may adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions, including increasing inflation, and its corresponding impact on the levels of consumer spending which may affect our licensees\u2019 sales. It is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending or inflation and any such predictions are inherently uncertain. The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of goods offered under our brands tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines. As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy.\nA significant disruption in our computer systems, including from a malicious attack, and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems, could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our operations and to communicate with our licensees, International Joint Venture partners and other third parties, and to collect, summarize and analyze results. We depend on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems. Our systems are potentially subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other malicious activities, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged, threatened, attacked or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to manage our internal control system, a loss in confidence by our partners, negative publicity and lost revenue, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nProvisions in our charter and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, discourage a takeover and adversely affect our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of making more difficult, delaying or deterring unsolicited attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock, none of which is outstanding.\nWe are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date it acquired that status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation and business.\nWe rely on social media, as one of our marketing strategies, to have a positive impact on both the value and reputation of our brands. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation, or that of any of our licensees or business partners, were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Use of social media platforms and weblogs by third parties provides access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested parties. The opportunity for dissemination of information on these platforms, including negative or inaccurate information about Iconix or its brands, is virtually limitless and the effect is immediate. For example, any bad, controversial or otherwise offending behavior by any of our paid spokespeople or other persons associated with our brands (whether paid or unpaid, and whether there is any current affiliation with such persons), could negatively impact our brands or the perception of such branded products in the marketplace, even if the offending behavior has no connection to such brand, product or the Company. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our reputation, business and financial results. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. It could also result in decreases in sales by our licensees, which in turn could negatively impact our revenues and cash flows.\nRecent and ongoing developments relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s leaving the European Union could adversely affect us or our licenses.\nThe decision made in the United Kingdom referendum in June 2016 to leave the European Union (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d) has led to volatility in global financial markets, and in particular in the markets of the United Kingdom and across Europe, and may also lead to weakening in political, regulatory, consumer, corporate and financial confidence in the United Kingdom and Europe. The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, governed by transitional terms that will expire on December 31, 2020. During this transition phase, the United Kingdom and the European Union will seek to negotiate and finalize a new, more permanent trade deal. Due to political uncertainty, it is not possible to anticipate whether the United Kingdom and the European Union will be able to agree on and implement a new trade agreement or what the nature of such trade arrangement will be. In the absence of such an agreement there would be no transitional provisions and the relationship between the United Kingdom and\nthe European Union would be based on the World Trade Organization rules. The process for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, and the longer term economic, legal, political, regulatory and social framework to be put in place between the United Kingdom and the European Union remain unclear and may lead to ongoing political and economic uncertainty and periods of exacerbated volatility in both the United Kingdom and in wider European markets for some time. The mid-to-long term uncertainty may have a negative effect on the performance of Iconix Europe, our London-based joint venture, as well as Iconix MENA LTD and Diamond Icon, LLC, our joint ventures which were established under the laws of the United Kingdom. In addition, we have license agreements in place with licensees across many of our brands in the United Kingdom, maintain a wholly-owned subsidiary established under the laws of the United Kingdom; and have employees, offices and showroom space in the United Kingdom related to our Umbro and Lee Cooper brands. The impact of Brexit on the foregoing aspects of our business are unknown at this time. Brexit could have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and negatively impact our business and that of our licensees. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain and will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom may make to retain access to European Union markets. Brexit also could lead to uncertainty with respect to the United Kingdom legal and regulatory framework and the enforcement of our legal and intellectual property rights. Additionally, the decision made in the United Kingdom referendum may lead to a call for similar referenda in other European jurisdictions which may cause increased economic volatility and uncertainty in the European and global markets. This volatility and uncertainty may have an adverse effect on the economy generally and on the ability of us and our portfolio companies to execute our respective strategies and to receive attractive returns. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business, licensees, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.", "PERMNO": 76215, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "ICON"}
