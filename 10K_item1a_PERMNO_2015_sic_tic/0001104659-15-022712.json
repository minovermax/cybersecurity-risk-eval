{"cik": "887359", "company": "Vericel Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not known to us or that we do not consider to be material at this time. If the events described in these risks occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have incurred losses, anticipate continuing to incur losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability for some time or at all.\nWhile we are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company following our acquisition of the cell therapy and regenerative medicine (CTRM) business of Sanofi, a French soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme (Sanofi), we have not yet generated significant revenues. We have incurred net losses each year since our inception in 1989, including net losses of $19.9 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had accumulated a deficit of approximately $308 million and had $30.3 million of cash. On September 17, 2014, we sold 15,784,313 shares of our common stock in a public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $37.5 million. Based on our current plan, we expect that this cash will be sufficient to sustain our operations until we achieve profitability.\nAlthough we believe we will achieve profitability without the need to raise additional capital, we may continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years despite sales increasing and margins improving, due to continuing expenses related to our research and development programs, and the expense associated with continuing the commercialization of our approved products. We cannot predict with any certainty the amount of future losses. Our ability to maintain profitability will depend, among other things, increasing sales of our current products, improving gross margins, successfully commercializing our new products, completing the development of our product candidates, timely initiation and completion of clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, establishing manufacturing, sales and marketing arrangements with third parties, maintaining supplies of key manufacturing components and the possible acquisition and development of complementary products. Therefore, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn the longer term, we may need to raise additional funds in order to continue to complete product development programs and complete clinical trials needed to market and commercialize our current product candidates. We cannot be certain that actual results will not differ materially from our current projections and that current capital will be sufficient to achieve profitability nor that funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Some of the factors that will impact our ability to raise additional capital and our overall success include:\n\u00b7 Our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business with our existing business and streamline its operations;\n\u00b7 The rate and degree of progress for our product development;\n\u00b7 Our ability to maintain our facility as an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compliant and validated product manufacturing facility;\n\u00b7 The rate of regulatory approval to proceed with clinical trial programs;\n\u00b7 The level of success achieved in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 The requirements for marketing authorization from regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7 The liquidity and market volatility of our equity securities;\n\u00b7 Regulatory and manufacturing requirements and uncertainties; and\n\u00b7 Technological developments by competitors.\nWhile we have access to certain amounts of financing through an agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park) and an at-the-market sales agreement (ATM) with MLV & Co., LLC (MLV) (formerly McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak), there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock and our stock price and the ability to terminate the agreement with notice, which limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through these agreements with Lincoln Park and the ATM. We anticipate that we will incur certain non-recurring charges in connection with the integration of the CTRM business; however, we cannot identify the timing, nature and amount of all such charges. These costs could materially affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded. If funding is needed and we cannot raise such funds, we will not be able to develop, manufacture or enhance products, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to successfully integrate the acquired business and operations in the expected time frame may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results.\nWe believe that the acquisition of the acquired business will result in certain benefits, including certain manufacturing, sales and distribution and operational efficiencies. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, Vericel\u2019s existing business and the acquired business must be successfully combined. We may be unable to effectively integrate the acquired business into our organization, make the acquired business profitable, and may not succeed in managing the acquired business or the larger company that results from this acquisition. The process of integration of an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 Failure to successfully manage relationships with clients, distributors and suppliers;\n\u00b7 Demands on management related to the increase in size of the company after the acquisition;\n\u00b7 Diversion of management attention;\n\u00b7 Potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems;\n\u00b7 Difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u00b7 Inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u00b7 Inability to establish uniform standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7 Inability to retain the customers of the acquired business;\n\u00b7 Exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition; and\n\u00b7 Incurrence of additional expenses in connection with the integration process.\nIf the acquired business is not successfully integrated into our company, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, as well as our professional reputation. Furthermore, if we are unable to successfully integrate the acquired business and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Successful integration of the acquired business will depend on our ability to manage these operations, to realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by our products and eliminate certain excess costs of the acquired business.\nThe acquisition has resulted in the expansion of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs a result of our acquisition of the CTRM business on May 30, 2014, our employee base increased significantly from 38 employees as of March 31, 2014 to approximately 190 full-time employees as of December 31, 2014. We expect that such growth will impose significant additional responsibilities on our management. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The effective management of the acquired business could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our existing or future product candidates. In connection with the operation of the acquired business we expect to expand our internal sales and marketing capabilities as we build an internal sales and marketing organization and hire additional manufacturing, quality control, pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs, quality assurance, and management personnel as necessary to maintain or expand our processing operations. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and our other product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our current growth.\nWe may not be able to raise the required capital to conduct our operations, develop and commercialize our product candidates and otherwise grow and expand our business.\nNotwithstanding the net proceeds of approximately $37.5 million we received from our September 2014 public offering and our current projections that we can achieve profitability without raising additional capital, we will require substantial additional capital resources in order to complete the development of ixmyelocel-T for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM. Further, while we believe we have adequate capital to conduct a confirmatory trial for MACI as well as a pediatric trial for Epicel in pediatric patients, if the trials requested are larger or more costly than anticipated, we may need to raise additional capital.\nIn order to grow and expand our business, to introduce our new product candidates into the marketplace, we may need to raise additional funds. We may also need significant additional funds or a collaborative partner, or both, to finance the research and development activities of our cell therapy product candidates for additional indications.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including:\n\u00b7 Continued scientific progress in our research, clinical and development programs;\n\u00b7 Costs and timing of conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 Competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7 Avoiding infringement and misappropriation of third-party intellectual property;\n\u00b7 Obtaining valid and enforceable patents that give us a competitive advantage;\n\u00b7 Our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships;\n\u00b7 Our ability to scale up our production capabilities for larger quantities of our products;\n\u00b7 The effect of commercialization activities and facility expansions, if and as required; and\n\u00b7 Complementary business acquisitions or development opportunities.\nWe may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $15 million worth of shares of our common stock over a 30-month period generally in amounts up to 50,000 shares of our common stock on certain business days under a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) we entered into with Lincoln Park on January 21, 2014 (the Lincoln Park Equity Line). As of December 31, 2014, we had sold $3.7 million worth of shares to Lincoln Park. However, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock and our stock price, which limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time. The extent to which we rely on the Lincoln Park Equity Line as sources of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove impracticable or prohibitively dilutive, we may need to secure other sources of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Even if we sell the maximum amount we are eligible to sell to Lincoln Park the Purchase Agreement, we may need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive should we require it, the consequences may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company raised net proceeds of $7.1 million utilizing our ATM with MLV. The ATM, which as of December 31, 2014 had remaining capacity of approximately $7.8 million, allowed the Company to sell its common stock from time to time under a registration statement on Form S-3 filed in June 2011, pursuant to which the Company registered $100 million of its securities for public sale. The Form S-3 registration statement filed in June 2011 expired in July 2014.\nWe may try to access the public or private equity markets if conditions are favorable to complete a financing, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time, or whenever we require additional operating capital. In addition, we may seek collaborative relationships, incur debt and access other available funding sources. This additional funding may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Some of the factors that will impact our ability to raise additional capital and our overall success include:\n\u00b7 Our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business and further commercialize our products;\n\u00b7 The rate and degree of progress for our product development;\n\u00b7 The rate of regulatory approval to proceed with clinical trial programs;\n\u00b7 The level of success achieved in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 The requirements for marketing authorization from regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7 The liquidity and market volatility of our equity securities; and\n\u00b7 Regulatory and manufacturing requirements and uncertainties, and technological developments by competitors.\nIf adequate funds are not available in the future, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements and we may be required to delay or terminate research and development programs, curtail capital expenditures, and reduce business development and other operating activities, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals would severely limit our ability to sell our products and product candidates.\nWe must maintain our domestic and foreign regulatory approvals to continue to commercialize our products. In addition, we must obtain the approval of the FDA before commercial sales of our cell therapy product candidates may commence in the United States, which we believe will ultimately be the largest market for our products. We anticipate that we will also be required to obtain additional approvals from various foreign regulatory authorities to initiate sales activities of cell therapy product candidates in those jurisdictions. If we cannot demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of our product candidates, including our cell therapy product\ncandidates, produced in our production system, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could delay or withhold regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nEven after granting regulatory approval, the FDA and regulatory agencies in other countries continue to review and inspect marketed products, manufacturers and manufacturing facilities, which may create additional regulatory burdens. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including a withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, regulatory agencies may establish additional regulations that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or adversely affect the regulatory approvals of our products.\nAny changes in the governmental regulatory classifications of our products and product candidates could prevent, limit or delay our ability to market or develop our products and product candidates.\nThe FDA establishes regulatory requirements based on the regulatory status of a product. Because our product development programs are designed to satisfy the standards applicable to biological licensure for our cell therapy products, any change in the regulatory classification or designation would affect our ability to obtain FDA approval of our product candidates. As each of our cell therapy product candidates is, under current regulations, regulated as a biologic, a Biologics License Application (BLA) is required to be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to the marketing of any of our product candidates.\nOur product candidate, ixmyelocel-T, is still in clinical development. If we do not successfully continue or complete the clinical development of ixmyelocel-T, our ability to finance our operations may be adversely affected.\nOur near-term prospects depend in part upon our ability to successfully continue and complete clinical trials of our product candidate, ixmyelocel-T, and to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness, as well as its superiority over existing therapies and standards of care, if any. We are conducting an ongoing Phase 2b ixCELL DCM clinical trial in which we are following patients who have been treated with ixmylocel-T. Our ability to finance our company and to generate revenues will depend in part on our ability to obtain favorable results in the ongoing and planned clinical trials of ixmyelocel-T, including the ongoing ixCELL-DCM Phase 2b clinical trial, and to successfully develop and commercialize ixmyelocel-T. Ixmyelocel-T could be unsuccessful if it:\n\u00b7 Does not demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy in clinical trials, or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory standards for approval;\n\u00b7 Does not offer sufficient, clinically meaningful therapeutic or other improvements over existing or future drugs used to treat advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM;\n\u00b7 Is not capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or\n\u00b7 Is not accepted as safe, efficacious, cost-effective, less costly and preferable to current therapies in the medical community and by third-party payers.\nIf we are not successful in developing and commercializing ixmyelocel-T or are significantly delayed in doing so, our financial condition and future prospects may be adversely affected and we may experience difficulties in raising the substantial additional capital required to fund our business.\nOur products and product development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky.\nWe are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on new technologies. The novel nature of our therapeutics creates significant challenges in regard to product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance. For example, if regulatory agencies have limited experience in approving cellular therapies for commercialization, the development and commercialization pathway for our therapies may be subject to increased uncertainty, as compared to the pathway for new conventional drugs.\nFurther, when manufacturing autologous cell therapies, the number and the composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient, in part due to the age of the patient, since the therapy is dependent on patient specific physiology. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale. As a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for autologous cell therapy products could be delayed or may never be completed.\nOur products represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept. Furthermore, the success of our products is dependent on wider acceptance by the medical community.\nWhile our acquired products have had some commercial success to date, the broader market may not understand or accept our products. Our products represent new treatments or therapies and compete with a number of more conventional products and\ntherapies manufactured and marketed by others. The new nature of our products creates significant challenges in regards to product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, and third-party reimbursement. As a result, the commercialization of our current products and development pathway for our potential products may be subject to increased scrutiny, as compared to the pathway for more conventional products.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of our marketed or potential products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 The clinical safety and effectiveness of our products and their perceived advantage over alternative treatment methods;\n\u00b7 Our ability to convince health care providers that the use of our products in a particular procedure is more beneficial than the standard of care or other available methods;\n\u00b7 Our ability to explain clearly and educate others on the autologous use of patient-specific human tissue, to avoid potential confusion with and differentiate ourselves from the ethical controversies associated with human fetal tissue and engineered human tissue;\n\u00b7 Adverse reactions involving our products or the products or product candidates of others that are human tissue based;\n\u00b7 Our ability to supply a sufficient amount of our product to meet regular and repeated demand in order to develop a core group of medical professionals familiar with and committed to the use of our products; and\n\u00b7 The cost of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.\nIf patients or the medical community do not accept our potential products as safe and effective for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, it could affect our sales, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While acceptance by the medical community may be fostered by broad evaluation via peer-reviewed literature, we may not have the resources to facilitate sufficient publication.\nOur inability to complete our product development activities successfully would materially limit our ability to operate or finance our operations.\nIn order to commercialize our cell product candidates in the United States, we must complete substantial clinical trials and obtain sufficient safety, purity and potency results to support required regulatory approval and market acceptance of our cell product candidates. We may not be able to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, or successfully market our technologies or product candidates. We, and any of our potential collaborators, may encounter problems and delays relating to research and development, regulatory approval and intellectual property rights of our technologies and product candidates. Our research and development programs may not be successful, and our cell culture technologies and product candidates may not facilitate the production of cells outside the human body with the expected results. Our technologies and cell product candidates may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials, and we may not obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our technologies or product candidates and the cells produced in such products. If any of these events occur, we may not have adequate resources to continue operations for the period required to resolve any issues delaying commercialization and we may not be able to raise capital to finance our continued operations during the period required for resolution of any such issues.\nWe must successfully complete our clinical trials to be able to market certain of our products and product candidates. Clinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent the continued commercialization of our products or future therapeutic product candidates.\nTo be able to market therapeutic cell products in the United States, we must demonstrate, through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials, the safety and effectiveness of our processes and product candidates. If our clinical trials are not successful, our products may not be marketable. The results of early stage clinical trials do not ensure success in later clinical trials, and interim results are not necessarily predictive of final results.\nWith respect to any clinical trials affecting our products or product candidates, failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 Delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 Delays in obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 Slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment in our clinical trials, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u00b7 Limited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third party payers for the use of biological products supplied for use in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 Negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u00b7 Unforeseen side effects interrupting, delaying, or halting clinical trials of any future therapeutic product candidates, and possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of any future therapeutic product candidates;\n\u00b7 Unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 Approval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u00b7 Inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u00b7 Inability to replicate in large controlled studies safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials;\n\u00b7 Inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u00b7 Unavailability of clinical trial supplies.\nMoreover, our ability to complete the clinical trials for our product candidates in a timely manner depends on additional factors such as rate of patient enrollment. Patient enrollment can vary with the size of the patient population, the proximity of suitable patients to clinical sites, perceptions of the utility of cell therapy for the treatment of certain diseases, and the eligibility criteria for the study. For example, patients enrolling in future studies of ixmyelocel-T need to provide an adequate amount of bone marrow to process and expand for injection and some patients may not be able to provide sufficient starting material despite our study inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to prevent this. Bone marrow is an inherently variable starting material. We have experienced delays in patient accrual in our previous clinical trials. On March 27, 2013, we announced that we were stopping enrollment in the Phase 3 REVIVE clinical trial due to the slow patient accrual rate for the study and to optimize the use of our financial resources. If we experience similar delays in patient enrollment for other clinical trials, we could experience increased costs and delays associated with these trials, which would impair our product development programs and our ability to market our products.\nFurthermore, the FDA monitors the progress of clinical trials and it may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time due to patient safety or other considerations.\nOur research programs are currently directed at improving product functionality for certain clinical indications, improving product shelf life, and decreasing the cost of manufacturing our products. These production process changes may alter the functionality of our cells and require various additional levels of experimental and clinical testing and evaluation. Any such testing could lengthen the time before these products would be commercially available.\nEven if successful clinical results are reported for a product from a completed clinical trial, this does not mean that the results will be sustained over time, or will be sufficient for a marketable or regulatory approvable product.\nWe may rely on third parties to conduct some of our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may use clinical research organizations (CROs) to assist in conduct of our clinical trials. There are numerous alternative sources to provide these services. However, we may face delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or competent fashion, or if we are forced to change service providers. Any third party that we hire to conduct clinical trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If we experience significant delays in the progress of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for product candidates could be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue would be delayed or prevented. In addition, we and any provider that we retain will be subject to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements. If GCP and other regulatory requirements are not adhered to by us or our third-party providers, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nAny failure of such CRO to successfully accomplish clinical trial monitoring, data collection, safety monitoring and data management and the other services it provides for us in a timely manner and in compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical development of our products and obtain regulatory approval. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a CRO may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternate service provider. However, making such changes may be costly and may delay our trials, and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible. Additionally, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct our trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost.\nFailure of third parties, including Vention Medical, to manufacture or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials used in our ixmyelocel-T cell manufacturing process would impair our cell product development.\nWe rely on third parties, including Vention Medical, Inc. (Vention), to manufacture and/or supply certain of our devices/manufacturing equipment and to manufacture and/or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other\nmaterials used in our cell manufacturing process to develop our marketed cell therapy products and our product candidates. Vention is our sole supplier of cell cassettes used in the ixmyelocel-T manufacturing process, and it would be difficult to obtain alternate sources of supply on a short-term basis. If any of our manufacturers or suppliers fails to perform its respective obligations, or if our supply of certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials is limited or interrupted, it could impair our ability to manufacture our products, which would delay our ability to conduct our clinical trials or market our product candidates on a timely and cost-competitive basis, if at all.\nIn addition, we may not be able to continue our present arrangements with our suppliers, supplement existing relationships, establish and maintain new relationships or be able to identify and obtain the ancillary materials that are necessary to develop our product candidates in the future. Our dependence upon third parties for the supply and manufacture of these items could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver commercially feasible products on a timely and competitive basis.\nFailure by our third-party manufacturers, including Vention, to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our products could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.\nThird-party manufacturers, such as Vention, must be inspected by the FDA for current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, compliance before they can produce commercial product. We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.\nManufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements. A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval. This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nComplying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nThe manufacture of cell therapy products is characterized by inherent risks and challenges and has proven to be a costly endeavor relative to manufacturing other therapeutics products. We have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully and efficiently manage the manufacturing of our products, either ourselves or through third-party contractors with whom we may enter into strategic relationships.\nThe manufacture of cell therapy products, such as our products and product candidates, is highly complex and is characterized by inherent risks and challenges such as autologous raw material inconsistencies, logistical challenges, significant quality control and assurance requirements, manufacturing complexity, and significant manual processing. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy, such as most pharmaceuticals, cell therapy products are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. We attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by continuing to improve the characterization of all of our input materials, utilizing multiple vendors for supply of qualified biological materials, and manufacturing some of these materials ourselves. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture cell therapy products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and could experience difficulties in the continued manufacturing of our products. Because our experience in manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution is limited, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in our efforts to efficiently manage the manufacturing, sale and distribution of our products or have to rely on third-party contractors over which we may not have direct control to manufacture our products. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we or any third-party contractors with whom we enter into strategic relationships will be successful in streamlining manufacturing operations and implementing efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price and production standards or production volumes to achieve profitability. Our failure to develop these\nmanufacturing processes and capabilities in a timely manner could prevent us from achieving our growth and profitability objectives as projected or at all.\nWe intend to obtain assistance to market our products and some of our future cell products through collaborative relationships with companies with established sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our inability to develop and maintain those relationships would limit our ability to market, sell and distribute our products. Our inability to enter into successful, long-term relationships could require us to develop alternate arrangements at a time when we need sales, marketing or distribution capabilities to meet existing demand. We may market one or more of our products through our own sales force. Our inability to develop and retain a qualified sales force could limit our ability to market, sell and distribute our cell products.\nWe have limited manufacturing capacity and our commercial manufacturing operations in the U.S. depend on one facility. Similarly, manufacturing of our lead product candidate, ixmyelocel-T, is conducted at one facility. If either facility is destroyed or we experience any manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays, this could limit supply of our products or adversely affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials and our business would be adversely impacted.\nWe presently conduct all of our commercial manufacturing operations in the U.S. at one facility located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a result, all of the commercial manufacturing of our marketed products, Epicel and Carticel, for the U.S. market takes place at a single U.S. facility. In addition, clinical trials for certain product candidates would primarily depend upon the manufacturing of such product candidates in the same Cambridge facility. Similarly, manufacturing of our product candidate ixmyelocel-T takes place at one facility located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. If regulatory, manufacturing or other problems require us to discontinue production at either facility, we will not be able to supply our products to our patients or have supplies for any clinical trials, which would adversely impact our business. If either facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss or similar events, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity or replace our facility at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to a third party. Even if we could transfer manufacturing from one facility to the other or to a third party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since an alternative facility would need to comply with the applicable regulatory and quality standard requirements whereby validation and FDA approval would be required before any products manufactured at that facility could be made commercially available.\nCurrently, we maintain insurance coverage totaling $4.8 million in Denmark and $33.7 million in the U.S. against damage to our property and equipment, an additional $33 million to cover business interruption and extra expenses, and $1.0 million to cover research and development restoration expenses. If we have underestimated our insurance needs, we will not have sufficient insurance to cover losses above and beyond the limits on our policies.\nWe are subject to significant regulation with respect to the manufacturing of our products.\nAll of those involved in the preparation of a cellular therapy for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing supply contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators, are subject to extensive and continuing government regulations by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third party contractors and suppliers must pass inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of FDA approval of our products. The FDA also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third party contractors. In addition, the FDA may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our products or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted.\nOur manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts was inspected by the FDA in 2014. On March 19, 2014, the FDA issued a Form 483 List of Inspectional Observations. A Form 483 is issued when, in an investigator\u2019s judgment, the observed conditions or practices observed during an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility indicate that an FDA-regulated product may be in violation of FDA\u2019s requirements. We have completed remedial measures to improve our manufacturing process and have responded to all FDA observations. Generally, if any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the FDA may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales, recalls, warning letters, market withdrawals, seizures or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nWe could incur significant costs complying with environmental and health and safety requirements, or as a result of liability for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use.\nOur research and development and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental requirements, including regulations governing the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, discharge to air and water, the cleanup of contamination and occupational health and safety matters. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury. Under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites where we have sent wastes. These could include costs relating to contamination that did not result from any violation of law, and in some circumstances, contamination that we did not cause. We may incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with environmental laws. Any such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. The enactment of stricter laws or regulations, the stricter interpretation of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at our own or third party sites may require us to make additional expenditures, which could be material.\nIn order to market any of our product candidates, including MACI and ixmyelocel-T, in the United States, the FDA requires us to file a BLA.\nThe FDA approved Carticel as a biological product, for which we currently hold a biologics license. MACI and ixmyelocel-T are also subject to the FDA\u2019s biological product requirements, which will require us to submit a new BLA for each product prior to being granted marketing approval. To the extent the FDA regulates each of MACI and ixmyelocel-T as a biological product and requires us to file a BLA, we would be unable to sell MACI or ixmyelocel-T unless and until we receive BLA approval from the FDA, which requires that we conduct clinical trials in support of approval of a BLA, which would be expensive and time consuming, and uncertain as to outcome. For example, the FDA may require that we conduct one or more clinical trials in support of approval of a BLA, which would result in the expenditure of additional financial resources and extended timelines to commercialization.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be significantly and negatively affected by substantial governmental regulations.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Overall, there appears to be a trend toward more stringent regulation worldwide, and we do not anticipate this trend to dissipate in the near future.\nIn general, the development, testing, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. The regulatory process requires the expenditure of significant time, effort and expense to bring new products to market. For example, the FDA approved Epicel as a HUD pursuant to an HDE application. A HUD is a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States per year. A HUD with an approved HDE is approved by the FDA for marketing. However, Investigational Review Board (IRB) approval is required before a HUD can be used at a facility, with the exception of emergency use. The HDE holder is responsible for ensuring that a HUD approved under an HDE is administered only in facilities having an IRB constituted and acting in accordance with the agency\u2019s regulation governing IRBs, including continuing review of use of the device. HUDs are also subject to additional FDA requirements, such as adverse event reporting and the submission of updated information on a periodic basis to demonstrate that the HUD designation is still valid. Failure to meet FDA requirements pertaining to a HUD could result in the suspension or revocation of the HDE.\nIf the HDE is suspended or revoked, marketing approval for Epicel would require the submission and approval of a premarket approval application (PMA) in order to be made commercially available. The PMA process is costly, lengthy and uncertain. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. If the HDE approval for Epicel was withdrawn, and we were unable to obtain approval of a PMA, we could not market Epicel for sale in the U.S.\nWe are also required to implement and maintain stringent reporting, labeling and record keeping procedures. More specifically, in the United States, both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. Compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements, including the FDA\u2019s cGMP recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. Our failure to comply with U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental regulations could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory clearance or approvals, product\nrecalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facility are possible.\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical, biologic and medical industries also are subject to many complex laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and targeting healthcare fraud and abuse, with these laws and regulations being subject to interpretation. In many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In certain public statements, governmental authorities have taken positions on issues for which little official interpretation was previously available. Some of these positions appear to be inconsistent with common practices within the industry but have not previously been challenged.\nVarious federal and state agencies have become increasingly vigilant in recent years in their investigation of various business practices, such as the federal Anti-kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. Governmental and regulatory actions against us can result in various actions that could adversely impact our operations, including:\n\u00b7 The recall or seizure of products;\n\u00b7 The suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product;\n\u00b7 The suspension of shipments from particular manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7 The imposition of fines and penalties;\n\u00b7 The delay of our ability to introduce new products into the market;\n\u00b7 Our exclusion or the exclusion of our products from being reimbursed by federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, or VA, health programs and Civilian Health and Medical Program Uniformed Service, or CHAMPUS); and\n\u00b7 Other civil or criminal prosecution or sanctions against us or our employees, such as fines, penalties or imprisonment.\nAny of these actions, in combination or alone, or even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the United States, if the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of certain products, refuse to grant pending approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products.\nIn many of the foreign countries in which our products are marketed, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, clinical efficacy, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import/export restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries, such as the Medicinal Products Directive and the ATMP guidelines, governing products in the EU, are similar to those of the FDA. In addition, in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. Failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs both the U.S. and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent, we may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future. Our products and our operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization, or ISO. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business will be harmed.\nChanges to our products or product candidates may require new regulatory approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until approvals are obtained.\nModifications to our products or product candidates may require new regulatory approvals, including supplements to any of our Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) requesting FDA authorization to administer our investigational biological product to humans or supplements to our BLA or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified products until these approvals are obtained. We may not be able to obtain those additional approvals for the changes or additional indications in a timely manner, or at all. Obtaining approvals can be a time consuming process, and delays in obtaining\nrequired future approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or improved products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nThe manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for each of our products is subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with cGMP and Good Tissue Practice (GTP) regulations for the manufacture of our products and other regulations which cover requirements such as the methods and documentation pertaining to production controls, labeling, packaging, storage and shipment of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, enforce the cGMP, GTP and other regulations through periodic inspections. For example, the holder of an approved BLA or HUD is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet its specifications. The holder of an approved BLA or HDE device must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP and to confirm that the manufactured products conform with the description in the PMA. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nThe failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u00b7 Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7 Unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u00b7 Client notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;\n\u00b7 Recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u00b7 Operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u00b7 Refusing or delaying our requests for approval of new products or modified products;\n\u00b7 Operating restrictions;\n\u00b7 Withdrawing product approvals that have already been granted;\n\u00b7 Refusal to approve a pending marketing application, such as a BLA or supplements to a BLA submitted by us;\n\u00b7 Refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u00b7 Criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all. In addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-approval studies, and post-market surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products. We also must comply with adverse event reporting requirements, which require that we report certain adverse events involving patient use or treatment with our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as cGMP or GTP, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur marketed products may be used by physicians for indications that are not approved by the FDA. If the FDA finds that we marketed our products in a manner that promoted off-label use, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means, for example, that we may not make claims about the use of our marketed products, Carticel or Epicel, outside\nof their approved indications, and we may not proactively discuss or provide information on off-label uses of Carticel or Epicel, with very specific and limited exceptions. The FDA does not, however, restrict physicians from prescribing products for off-label uses in the practice of medicine. Should the FDA determine that our activities constitute the promotion of off-label uses, the FDA could bring action to prevent us from distributing Carticel or Epicel for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecutions.\nIf the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, the DOJ, or another federal or state agency determines that we have promoted off-label use of our products, we may be subject to various penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, and the off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nIn addition to the FDA restrictions on our marketed products, several other types of state and federal healthcare laws have been applied by DOJ and state attorneys general to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. While physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses and indications, if other federal or state regulatory authorities determine that we have engaged in off-label promotion through remuneration, kickbacks or other monetary benefits to prescribers, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and could be prohibited from participating in government healthcare programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. In addition, government agencies or departments could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion and, potentially, caused the submission of false claims. Even if we are successful in resolving such matters without incurring penalties, responding to investigations or prosecutions will likely result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nThe price and sale of any of our products may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation.\nMaintaining and growing sales of our products will depend in large part on the availability of adequate coverage and the extent to which third-party payers, including health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and government health administration authorities such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs will pay for the cost of the products and related treatment. Hospitals and other healthcare provider clients that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which such products are used, including the cost of the purchase of these products. Third-party payers are also increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both coverage and the amounts that they will pay for certain products, and, as a result, they may not cover or continue to provide adequate payment for our products. We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products and product candidates to such payers\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our products and future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in our products and future product development. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, reimbursement is available only to limited levels, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels, we may not be able to successfully grow the sales of our products or commercialize any product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained.\nCoverage decisions and payment amounts are established at the discretion of the individual third-party payer, and the regulations that govern pricing, coverage and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Many private payers in the United States, however, use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicare continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. While certain procedures using our products are currently covered by Medicare and other third-party payers, future action by CMS or other government agencies may diminish payments to physicians, outpatient centers and/or hospitals for covered services. As a result, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level or reimbursed at all.\nFurthermore, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level. Nor can we be certain that third-party payers using a methodology that sets amounts based on the type of procedure performed, such as those utilized by Medicare and in many privately managed care systems, will view the cost of our products to be justified so as\nto incorporate such costs into the overall cost of the procedure. Moreover, we are unable to predict what changes will be made to the reimbursement methodologies used by third-party payers in the future.\nThere are no assurances that we will be able to submit a Humanitarian Device Exemption supplement for Epicel or obtain FDA approval in order to sell Epicel for profit.\nEpicel was designated as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) in 1998 and a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for the product was submitted in 1999. HUDs are devices that are intended for diseases or conditions that affect or are manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals annually in the United States. Under the HDE approval of 2007, Epicel cannot not be sold for an amount that exceeds the cost of research and development, fabrication and distribution. However, pursuant to the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA), a HUD can be sold for profit if certain conditions are met. Under current law, an HDE holder can make a profit on its HUD after receiving HDE approval if the device is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that occurs in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation, and such device is labeled for use in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation in which the disease or condition occurs; or is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that does not occur in pediatric patients or that occurs in pediatric patients in such numbers that the development of the device for such patients is impossible, highly impracticable, or unsafe. HUD devices are assigned an Annual Distribution Number (ADN) by the FDA that caps the number of devices that can be distributed.\nWe are currently investigating Epicel\u2019s eligibility for exemption from the profit prohibition and have requested a pre-submission meeting with the FDA to discuss the process and required data for submitting an HDE supplement to obtain an exemption from the profit prohibition. Even if we submit an HDE supplement, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve our application in a timely manner, or at all. If we are unable to submit an HDE supplement, or if the supplement is not approved by the FDA, we will be unable to sell Epicel for profit. The FDA can and does reject requests for an exemption from the profit prohibition if the required eligibility criteria are not met. If we are unable to sell Epicel for profit, we will not be able to attain profitability for Epicel and may be forced to discontinue sales of Epicel, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe face intense competition in the markets targeted by our products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our products will face intense competition from existing or future products.\nAll of our products face intense competition from existing and future products marketed by large companies. These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify product candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective or cost less than our products. These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming. These activities would adversely affect our ability to effectively commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.\nIf we do not keep pace with our competitors and with technological and market changes, our products will become less attractive or obsolete and our business may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, subject to rapid technological changes, and vary for different candidates and processes that directly compete with our products. Our competitors in the medical and biotechnology industries may have superior products, research and development, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities, and financial resources or marketing positions. Furthermore, our competitors may have developed, or could in the future develop, new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete. As an example, in the past, published studies have suggested that hematopoietic stem cell therapy use for bone marrow transplantation, following marrow ablation due to chemotherapy, may have limited clinical benefit in the treatment of breast cancer, which was a significant portion of the overall hematopoietic stem cell transplant market. This resulted in the practical elimination of this market for our cell-based product for this application.\nOur cell manufacturing system for ixmyelocel-T is designed to improve and automate the processes for producing cells used in therapeutic procedures. Even if we are able to demonstrate improved or equivalent results, the cost or process of treatment and other factors may cause researchers and practitioners to not use our products and we could suffer a competitive disadvantage. To the extent that others develop new technologies that address the targeted application for our products, our business will suffer. Finally, if we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies in a timely manner, the demand for our products may decrease or our products could become obsolete, and our revenue may decline.\nEthical, legal, social and other concerns surrounding the use of human tissue in synthetic biologically engineered products may negatively affect public perception of us or our products, or may result in increased scrutiny of our products and any future product candidates from a regulatory perspective, thereby reducing demand for our products, restricting our ability to market our products, or adversely affecting the market price for our common stock.\nThe commercial success of our products depends in part on general public acceptance of the use of human tissue for the treatment of human diseases and other conditions. While not as controversial as the use of embryonic stem cells and fetal tissue, the use of adult tissue has been the subject of substantial debate regarding related ethical, legal and social issues. We do not use embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue, but the public may not be able to, or may fail to, differentiate our autologous use of adult tissue from the use by others of embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue. This could result in a negative perception of our company or our products.\nFuture adverse events in the field of cellular based therapy or changes in public policy could also result in greater governmental regulation of our products and potential regulatory uncertainty or delay relating to any required testing or approval.\nUse of animal-derived materials could harm our product development and commercialization efforts.\nSome of the manufacturing materials and/or components that we use in, and which are critical to, implementation of our technology involve the use of animal-derived products, including fetal bovine serum. Supplier changes or regulatory actions may limit or restrict the availability of such materials for clinical and commercial use for a variety of reasons including contamination or perceived risk of contamination with an adventitious agent, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in one of our suppliers\u2019 herds. This may lead to a restricted supply of the serum currently required for our product manufacturing processes. Any restrictions on these materials would impose a potential competitive disadvantage for our products or prevent our ability to manufacture our cell products. The FDA has issued regulations for controls over bovine material in animal feed. These regulations do not appear to affect our ability to purchase the manufacturing materials we currently use. However, the FDA may propose new regulations that could affect our operations. Our inability to develop or obtain alternative compounds would harm our product development and commercialization efforts. There are certain limitations in the supply of certain animal-derived materials, which may lead to delays in our ability to complete clinical trials or eventually to meet the anticipated market demand for our cell products.\nCarticel, MACI or any other product candidate for which we seek approval as a biologic, may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, as part of the PPACA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCI Act, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement the BPCI Act may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. While the BCPI Act provides for a twelve-year period of exclusivity, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider any of our future product candidates to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated.\nMoreover, the extent to which a biosimilar product, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nHealth care reform measures and changes in policies, funding, staffing and leadership at the FDA and other agencies could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future results of operations and the future results of operations of our potential customers.\nFurthermore, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (jointly, the PPACA), which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u00b7 An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u00b7 Expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u00b7 Expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\nNew requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the PPACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection required and reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) required by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u00b7 Expansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u00b7 A licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u00b7 A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u00b7 Creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and\n\u00b7 Establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the\nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nAdditionally, individual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally-mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payers or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. This can reduce demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAdditionally, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nTissue-based products are regulated differently in different countries. These requirements may be costly and result in delay or otherwise preclude the distribution of our products in some foreign countries, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nTissue based products are regulated differently in different countries. Many foreign jurisdictions have a different and may have a more difficult regulatory pathway for human tissue based products, which may prohibit the distribution of these products until the applicable regulatory agencies grant marketing approval, or licensure. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and we may never seek such approvals, or if we do, we may never gain those approvals. Any adverse events in our clinical trials for a future product under development could negatively impact our products.\nCompetitor companies or hospitals may be able to take advantage of the EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without a marketing authorization.\nThe EU medicines rules allow individual member states to permit the supply of a medicinal product without a marketing authorization to fulfill special needs, where the product is supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of a healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility.\nThis may, in certain countries, also apply to products manufactured in a country outside the EU and imported to treat specific patients or small groups of patients. In addition, Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products do not need a marketing authorization if they are prepared on a non-routine basis and are used within the same EU member state in a hospital under the exclusive professional responsibility of a medical practitioner and in accordance with a medical prescription for a custom-made product for an individual patient (named-patient basis).\nThese exemptions could allow our competitors to make sales in the EU without having obtained a marketing authorization and without undergoing the expense of clinical trials, especially if those competitors have cell processing facilities in the relevant EU member state. Similarly, certain hospitals may be able to compete with us on the basis of these rules. Because any such sales would be made without a marketing authorization, there would be no need for the competitor company or hospital to refer to the clinical data in our marketing authorization dossiers, and so any data exclusivity protection that we may obtain for our products would not prevent such competing sales.\nThe current credit and financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business.\nWe rely upon third parties for certain aspects of our business, including collaboration partners, wholesale distributors, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and third-party suppliers. Because of the recent tightening of global credit and the\nvolatility in the financial markets, there may be a delay or disruption in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our key manufacturing, quality and other management personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nOur success depends in large part upon the efforts of our key management and manufacturing and quality staff. The loss of any of these individuals, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel in a timely manner, could materially and adversely affect our business and our future prospects. In the future, we may need to seek additional manufacturing and quality staff members. There is a high demand for highly trained manufacturing and quality personnel in our industry. We face competition for such personnel from other companies, research and academic institutions and other entities. We do not know whether we will be able to attract, train and retain highly qualified manufacturing and quality personnel in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A loss of one or more of our key personnel could severely and negatively impact our operations. Our key personnel are employed \u201cat-will,\u201d and any of them may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. We have no present intention of obtaining key man life insurance on any of our key management, manufacturing, quality or other personnel.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe have no patent protection for Epicel.\nWe have no issued patents or pending patent applications relating to Epicel. While we attempt to protect our proprietary information as trade secrets through certain agreements with our employees, consultants, agents and other organizations to which we disclose our proprietary information, we cannot give any assurance that these agreements will provide effective protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. If other cultured epidermal autografts are approved and marketed, we will be unable to prevent them from competing with Epicel in the marketplace. We expect that the presence of one or more competing products would reduce our market share and could negatively impact price levels and third party reimbursement policies for Epicel, any of which would materially affect our business.\nOur issued patents relating to Carticel and MACI will expire soon and may be insufficient to protect our business.\nWe have issued patents in the United States and in certain foreign countries that relate to the combinations of chondrocytes and collagen membranes used in Carticel and MACI. However, the issued patents relating to Carticel are scheduled to expire by August of 2016 in the U.S. and by 2022 in Europe. Furthermore, the issued patents relating to MACI are scheduled to expire by August of 2016 in the U.S. and by August of 2017 in Europe. When these patents expire we may be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated.\nThe patents we own may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with significant commercial protection or commercial advantage, and competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are similar to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications will be issued or that the scope of the claims in our pending patent applications will not be significantly narrowed or determined to be invalid\nIf our patents and proprietary rights do not provide substantial protection, then our business and competitive position will suffer.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to develop or license intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products and technologies. This involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions and uncertainties. We rely upon patent, trade secret, copyright and contract laws to protect proprietary technology and trademark law to protect brand identities. However, we cannot assure you that any patent applications filed by, assigned to, or licensed to us will be granted, and that the scope of any of our issued or licensed patents will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents or patents licensed to us could be successfully challenged, invalidated, held to be unenforceable, or circumvented so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. We also cannot assure you that the inventors of the patents and applications that we own or license were the first to invent or the first to file on the inventions, or that a third party will not claim ownership in one of our patents or patent applications. We cannot assure you that a third party does not have or will not obtain patents that dominate the patents we own or license now or in the future.\nPatent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights in this country and abroad are subject to this uncertainty. For example, from time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court (Supreme Court), other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may change the standards of patentability and any such changes\ncould have a negative impact on our business. There have been several cases involving \u201cgene patents\u201d and diagnostic claims that have been considered by the Supreme Court. A suit brought by multiple plaintiffs, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against Myriad Genetics (Myriad) and the USPTO, could impact biotechnology and diagnostic patents. That case involves certain of Myriad\u2019s U.S. patents related to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Federal Circuit court issued a written decision on July 29, 2011 that reversed the decision of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that Myriad\u2019s composition claims to \u201cisolated\u201d DNA molecules cover unpatentable subject matter. The Federal Circuit court instead held that the breast cancer genes are patentable subject matter. Subsequently, on March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories (Prometheus) a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient. According to that decision, Prometheus\u2019 claims failed to add enough inventive content to the underlying correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari in the Myriad case, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit court for further consideration in light of their decision in the Prometheus case. The Federal Circuit court heard oral arguments on July 20, 2012, and issued a decision on August 16, 2012. The Federal Circuit court reaffirmed its earlier decision and held that composition of matter claims directed to isolated nucleic acids are patent-eligible subject matter, but that method claims consisting of only abstract mental processes are not patent-eligible. On September 25, 2012, the ACLU filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the Federal Circuit court\u2019s decision with respect to the composition of matter claims. On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court granted the petition and agreed to review the case. On June 13, 2013, the Supreme Court issued a decision in the Myriad case. According to the decision, claims directed to genomic DNA cover unpatentable subject matter. However, claims directed to cDNA are patent eligible subject matter.\nOn March 4, 2014, the USPTO issued a memorandum entitled \u201c2014 Procedure For Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis Of Claims Reciting Or Involving Laws Of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, And/Or Natural Products\u201d. This memorandum provides guidance to patent examiners for examining claims reciting laws of nature/natural principles, natural phenomena, and/or natural products for patent eligibility in view of the Supreme Court decisions in Prometheus and Myriad. The guidance indicates that claims reciting such natural subject matter, read as a whole, that do not significantly differ from such natural subject matter should be rejected as non-statutory subject matter. We cannot assure you that our patent portfolio or our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and products will not be negatively impacted by the guidance issued by the USPTO, the decisions described above, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nCongress directed the USPTO to study effective ways to provide independent, confirming genetic diagnostic test activity where gene patents and exclusive licensing for primary genetic diagnostic tests exist. This study will examine the impact that independent second opinion testing has on providing medical care to patients; the effect that providing independent second opinion genetic diagnostic testing would have on the existing patent and license holders of an exclusive genetic test; the impact of current practices on testing results and performance; and the role of insurance coverage on the provision of genetic diagnostic tests. The USPTO was directed to report the findings of the study to Congress and provide recommendations for establishing the availability of independent confirming genetic diagnostic test activity by June 16, 2012. On August 28, 2012, the Department of Commerce sent a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary Committee leadership updating them on the status of the genetic testing report. The letter stated in part: \u201cGiven the complexity and diversity of the opinions, comments, and suggestions provided by interested parties, and the important policy considerations involved, we believe that further review, discussion, and analysis are required before a final report can be submitted to Congress.\u201d The USPTO issued a Request for Comments and Notice of Public Hearing on Genetic Diagnostic Testing on January 25, 2012, and held additional public hearings in February and March 2013. It is unclear whether the results of this study will be acted upon by the USPTO or result in Congressional efforts to change the law or process in a manner that could negatively impact our present or future patent portfolio.\nThere can be no assurance that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in either the Myriad or Prometheus case will not have a negative impact on biotechnology patents generally or the ability of biotechnology companies to obtain or enforce their patents in the future. Such negative decisions by the Supreme Court could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and un-patentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers and licensees. These agreements may be breached, and we might not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our competitors may also independently develop technologies substantially equivalent or superior to ours. If this were to occur, our business and competitive position would suffer.\nGiven our patent position in regard to our products, if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to these products, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our technology, including our knowledge regarding the processing our products, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. In an effort to protect these trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products or product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nWith respect to MACI and ixmyelocel-T, if we are unable to obtain and enforce patents and to protect our trade secrets, others could use our technology to compete with us, which could limit opportunities for us to generate revenues by licensing our technology and selling products.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secrets in the United States and in other countries. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents, our competitors could use our technology and create products that compete with our products, without paying license fees or royalties to us.\nThe preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications can be costly and time consuming. Our limited financial resources may not permit us to pursue patent protection of all of our technology and products throughout the world.\nEven if we are able to obtain issued patents covering our technology or products, we may have to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses to enforce our patent rights in order to protect our technology and products from infringing uses. We may not have the financial resources to finance the litigation required to preserve our patent and trade secret rights.\nA successful challenge to our trademarks could force us to rebrand Epicel, Carticel, or MACI.\nWe rely on our trademarks to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register a number of these trademarks. Third parties may challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing these new brands.\nIntellectual property litigation could harm our business. We may be subject to patent infringement claims that could be costly to defend, which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies, and which could prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of some of our products, require us to pay licensing fees to have freedom to operate and/or result in monetary damages or other liability for us.\nThe success of our business will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and other proprietary rights of others. Our cell processing system and cell compositions utilize a wide variety of technologies and we can give no assurance that we have identified or can identify all inventions and patents that may be infringed by development and manufacture of our cell\ncompositions. If the technology that we use infringes a patent held by others, we could be sued for monetary damages by the patent holder or its licensee, or we could be prevented from continuing research, development, and commercialization of products that rely on that technology, unless we are able to obtain a license to use the patent. The cost and availability of a license to a patent cannot be predicted, and the likelihood of obtaining a license at an acceptable cost would be lower if the patent holder or any of its licensees is using the patent to develop or market a product with which any of our existing product candidates or our products would compete. If we could not obtain a necessary license, we would need to develop or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which could prove costly and could cause delays in product development, or we could be forced to discontinue the development or marketing of any products that were developed using the technology covered by the patent.\nAlthough we have not been subject to any filed infringement claims, patents could exist or could be filed which would prohibit or limit our ability to market our products or maintain our competitive position. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate. Such litigation is typically protracted and the results are unpredictable. Intellectual property litigation would divert management\u2019s attention from developing our products and would force us to incur substantial costs regardless of whether we are successful. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties including treble damages and the opposing party\u2019s attorney fees, and force us to pay significant license fees and royalties or cease the development and sale of our products and processes.\nWe have hired and expect to continue to hire individuals who have experience in cell culture and cell based therapeutics and may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties. We caution these individuals not to use or reveal this third-party information, but we cannot assure you that these individuals will not use or reveal this third-party information. Thus, we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets. Such claims are expensive to defend and could divert our attention and could result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. These proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nLitigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7 Others may be able to make products that are the same as or similar to our products or product candidates, but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7 We or any strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7 We might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7 Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 It is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7 Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u00b7 Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7 We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7 The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOthers may challenge our patent or other intellectual property rights or sue us for infringement.\nThe government maintains certain rights in technology that we develop using government grant money and we may lose the revenues from such technology if we do not commercialize and utilize the technology pursuant to established government guidelines.\nCertain of our and our licensors\u2019 research have been or are being funded in part by government grants. As a result of such funding, the United States government has established guidelines and has certain rights in the technology developed with the grant. These rights include a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, worldwide license under such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the United States government has the right to require us to grant an exclusive license under any of such inventions to a third party if the United States government determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions; (ii) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Additionally, under the federal Bayh Dole Act, a party which acquires an exclusive license for an invention that was partially funded by a federal research grant is subject to the following government rights: (x) products using the invention which are sold in the United States are to be manufactured substantially in the United States, unless a waiver is obtained; (y) the government may force the granting of a license to a third party who will make and sell the needed product if the licensee does not pursue reasonable commercialization of a needed product using the invention; and (z) the United States government may use the invention for its own needs. If we fail to meet these guidelines, we would lose our exclusive rights to these products, and we would lose potential revenue derived from the sale of these products.\nThe use of our products and product candidates may expose us to product liability claims, and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance. As a result, such claims could affect our earnings and financial condition.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the manufacture and/or use of our products during clinical trials, or after commercialization, results in adverse events. Moreover, we derive the raw materials for our products from patients serving as their own donors, the production process is complex, and the handling requirements are specific, all of which increase the likelihood of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims. We may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted. Excessive insurance costs or uninsured claims would increase our operating loss and adversely affect our financial condition. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and could result in, among other things:\n\u00b7 Significant awards against us;\n\u00b7 Substantial litigation costs;\n\u00b7 Recall of the product;\n\u00b7 Injury to our reputation;\n\u00b7 Withdrawal of clinical trial participants; or\n\u00b7 Adverse regulatory action.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to remediate this material weakness and implement and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe identified a material weakness in the operation of our internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness relates to the evaluation of significant transactions and the financial close process. Specifically, we did not have a sufficient level of accounting and supervisory personnel nor did we have the appropriate level of technical accounting experience and training necessary for our financial reporting requirements during this period. This material weakness contributed to adjustments identified by our independent registered public accounting firm during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and still existed as of December 31, 2014. We have commenced efforts to remediate this material weakness through process and internal control improvements. However, if we cannot correct the material weakness we have identified, or if we experience other material weaknesses investor confidence and our stock price could be adversely affected. Further, if material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of the common stock of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those affecting the market price for our common stock in recent history.\nOur business in recent history differs from that of the CTRM business, and our current combined business differs from recent history, and accordingly, the results of operations for the combined company may be affected by factors different from those affecting our results of operation in recent history. As a result, the market price for our stock may be impacted differently in the future by those factors than it is currently.\nOur common stock price has been volatile and future sales of shares of common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of such shares.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock has been volatile, ranging in closing price between $2.61 and $6.49 during the year ended December 31, 2014. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as:\n\u00b7 Clinical trial results;\n\u00b7 Our inability to successfully integrate the acquired business with our existing business;\n\u00b7 The amount of our cash resources and our ability to obtain additional funding;\n\u00b7 Announcements of research activities, business developments, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 Entering into or terminating strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 Regulatory developments in both the United States and abroad;\n\u00b7 Disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 Changes in our revenues or expense levels;\n\u00b7 Seasonal or other variations in patient demand for Carticel and Epicel;\n\u00b7 Public concern regarding the safety, efficacy or other aspects of the products or methodologies we are developing;\n\u00b7 News or reports from other stem cell, cell therapy or regenerative medicine companies;\n\u00b7 Reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 Status of the investment markets;\n\u00b7 Concerns related to management transitions; and\n\u00b7 Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAny of these events may cause the price of our shares to fall, which may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. In addition, the stock market in general and the market prices for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility recently that often has been unrelated to the operating performance or financial conditions of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance or prospects.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nThe sale of our common stock through future equity offerings may cause dilution and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn the year-ended December 31, 2014, we sold (i) an aggregate gross amount of approximately $7.1 million worth of shares of common stock pursuant to our At-the-Market Sales Agreement (ATM) with MLV (ii) an aggregate of approximately $3.7 million worth of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Lincoln Park Equity Line, and (iii) on September 17, 2014, we sold 15.8 million shares of common stock under a Form S-1 registration statement and pursuant to a prospectus first made available on September 11, 2014. During 2013, we sold (i) an aggregate of approximately $5.2 million of shares of common stock pursuant to our ATM through December 31, 2013, and (ii) in August 2013, we sold 1.5 million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 1.5 million shares of common stock under a Form S-1 registration statement and pursuant to a prospectus supplement first made available on August 14, 2013. The ATM, which as of December 31, 2014 had remaining capacity of approximately $7.8 million, allowed us to sell our common stock from time to time under a registration statement on Form S-3 filed in June 2011, pursuant to which we registered $100 million of our securities for public sale. The Form S-3 registration statement filed in June 2011 expired in July 2014. Additionally, pursuant to the Lincoln Park Equity Line we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $15 million worth of shares of our common stock over a 30-month period generally in amounts up to 50 thousand shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had remaining capacity of approximately $11.3 million worth of shares under the Lincoln Park Equity Line. However, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock, our stock price and the ability to terminate the agreement with notice, which limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through the Lincoln Park Equity Line.\nSales of our common stock offered through future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock, and accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nWe expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nDue to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.\nEfforts to comply with recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and require additional management resources, and we still may fail to comply.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on their internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. In addition, in the event we are no longer a smaller reporting company, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements would be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is required to, but is unable to provide us with a report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nIf at any time our securities are no longer listed on a national securities exchange, including The NASDAQ Stock Market, or we have net tangible assets of $5.0 million or less and our common stock has a market price per share of less than $5.00, transactions in our common stock will be subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. If our common stock becomes subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u00b7 That a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u00b7 The broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u00b7 Obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u00b7 Make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u00b7 Sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u00b7 That the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nOur corporate documents and Michigan law contain provisions that may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.\nOur Board of Directors (Board) has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of these shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Michigan law contains a provision that makes it more difficult for a 10% shareholder, or its officers, to acquire a company. This authority, together with certain provisions of our charter documents, may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company. This effect could occur even if our shareholders consider the change in control to be in their best interest. We have adopted a shareholder rights plan, the purpose of which is, among other things, to enhance our Board\u2019s ability to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of our company is made in the future. The shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for\na third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our company or a large block of our company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 84511, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "VCEL"}
