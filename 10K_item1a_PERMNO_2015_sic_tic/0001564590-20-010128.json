{"cik": "1162112", "company": "RigNet, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors that could materially affect our business, financial position, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our common stock are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC.\nA large portion of our business fluctuates with the level of global oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, as a large portion of our customers are energy-related.\nDemand for our remote communication services and collaborative applications depends on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas. Our business will suffer if these expenditures decline. Our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas depends largely upon prevailing market conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nthe supply, demand and price expectations for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure levels of producers of oil and natural gas and drilling contractors;\n\u2022\nthe addressable market and utilization rate for drilling rigs and oilfield services;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or non-OPEC countries to influence and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide political, regulatory and economic environment;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics, or other \u201cacts of God\u201d affecting significant oil-importing countries, including the recent worldwide outbreak of coronavirus and its effect on travel, commerce and industry;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which alternative energy sources displace oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technology.\nOil and gas prices are volatile, and the oil and gas business is cyclical. When prices are perceived as being too low to generate acceptable returns, companies reduce expenditures for exploration and production. Oil prices declined\nsignificantly in the last quarter of 2018 and remained depressed throughout 2019. At the start of 2020, oil prices decreased further largely as a result of anticipated declines in demand from the coronavirus outbreak. Subsequently, in March 2020, the Saudi state producer, Aramco, reduced crude pricing in response to a split and price war with Russia. Following the Saudi reduction in pricing, Brent crude spot prices declined steeply to a mid-30 dollar per barrel range. As a result, we have seen a material decline in the demand for our products and services and significant pressure on the prices we can charge. Furthermore, our customers have experienced declines in their cash flows which has led to delays in payment, or nonpayment, for our products and services. Commodity price declines and increased volatility have particularly affected our customers\u2019 budgets for offshore capital investments and expenditures, which has had a material and adverse effect on our addressable market.\nFurthermore, the coronavirus has increased the volatility of oil and gas prices and has caused delays, supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions that have impacted the oil and gas industry and certain projects in the Asia Pacific region.\nThese conditions have had and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nContinued growth in satellite capacity has adversely affected our MCS segment revenues.\nNew digital applications are driving demand growth for bandwidth in our core MCS segment. However, we also continue to see growth in available satellite capacity and expect that growth to continue over the intermediate-term. While we have experienced bandwidth price declines from our satellite suppliers, due to competition for our oil and gas customers and declining capital investment by our customers, we have passed much of our realized savings onto our customers. While our site count has increased in the MCS segment, our revenue has continued to decline. If satellite capacity growth continues to outstrip demand growth or is expected to continue, we may be forced to reduce our prices in the MCS segment further, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to timely collect receivables, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nSome of our customers in the oil and gas industry have been through bankruptcy proceedings or other restructurings. In addition, as the global oil and gas industry has continued to experience reduced activity, many of our customers have unilaterally extended their payment practices. We actively manage our credit exposures and accounts receivable collections, but restructuring or insolvency proceedings by our largest customers, or continued lengthening of payment cycles could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we fail to keep pace with these changes or if access to telecommunications in remote locations becomes easier or less expensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nRecently some remote communications providers are offering the use of LTE and high-throughput satellite (HTS) service, instead of or in addition to the conventional Ku-band and C-band satellite space segments used today. Our business may be harmed if our competitors are more successful than us in introducing LTE and or HTS services to meet customer needs.\nIf alternative telecommunications services to remote locations become more readily accessible or less expensive, our business will suffer. New disruptive technologies could make our VSAT-based networks or other services obsolete or less competitive than they are today, requiring us to reduce the prices that we are able to charge for our services or causing us to undergo expensive transitions to new technologies. We may not be able to successfully respond to new technological developments and challenges or identify and respond to new market opportunities, services or solutions offered by competitors. In addition, our efforts to respond to technological innovations and competition may require significant capital investments and resources. Furthermore, if we invest either organically or through acquisition in new technology and any such technology is not successful, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur business model has historically required significant capital expenditures to win new business. To the extent we are unsuccessful in shifting some of those capital expenditures to our customers or suppliers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nHistorically we have purchased much of the equipment to provide new services to our customers and recovered the cost of that equipment through service charges over the life of the contract. This business model requires large capital expenditures at the start of new customer contracts. We are attempting to shift some of the upfront capital expenditures to our customers and/or suppliers through new contractual arrangements with them. However, we may be unsuccessful in shifting those required capital investments to our customers and/or suppliers. To the extent we are unable to finance growth capital or to change our business model, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. Furthermore, future new technologies could be capital intensive and may require capital expenditures in order for us to remain competitive.\nFailure to obtain and retain skilled personnel could impede our business and growth strategy.\nOur operations depend on a highly qualified executive, sales, technical, development, service and management team. Competition for personnel talent in the artificial intelligence, machine learning, engineering and cybersecurity industry is intense, and these roles are critical to our operation. Additionally, at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders we are seeking approval to add additional shares to our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan. If stockholders fail to approve this amendment, we will not have sufficient shares available for future inducement and retention awards. If we are unable make future awards, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel will be materially affected. Failure to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event that our cybersecurity measures fail or are otherwise inadequate, our systems or reputation may be damaged which could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with data privacy requirements applicable to us could result in costly regulatory enforcement actions and the imposition of significant penalties.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to run our business and our customers rely on our networks and security measures in running their businesses. Given that our customers own and operate critical infrastructure, the nature of cybersecurity threats are advanced and persistent. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such attacks. If such incidents or attacks do occur, they could have a material impact on our systems including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our facilities, equipment and data. In addition, we could be adversely affected by the theft or loss of confidential customer data or intellectual property. With the acquisition of Cyphre, we now market our cybersecurity services as an expertise. A successful cyberattack against us or one of our cybersecurity customers may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against these events or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, customer loss and litigation, caused by these events or the failure or inadequacy of our security systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is complex and evolving, and we believe it is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government entities and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. Internationally, certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we must comply. For example, the European Union has issued the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to anyone doing business in Europe. In general, GDPR sets a higher bar for privacy compliance, including new data subject rights, new mandatory security breach notification requirements, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments and extensive record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with GDPR can have significant consequences, including substantial fines and reputational damage. We continue to analyze the GDPR in respect of its burden and applicability to our global business operations. We may fail to comply with any of these requirements, and compliance with these requirements may increase our compliance burden and costs.\nWe have made and may in the future make selective acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, or we may be unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, or such acquisitions may underperform, which could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business and operating results.\nAlthough we presently do not have any acquisitions under consideration as of this filing, acquisitions have been a critical part of our strategy in the past and maybe in the future. Acquisitions involve certain known and unknown risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ from our expectations. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may pursue international acquisitions, which inherently pose more risks than domestic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nwe compete with others to acquire complementary products, technologies and businesses, which may result in decreased availability of, or increased price for, suitable acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain the necessary financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any or all of our potential acquisitions;\n\u2022\nwe may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce that we plan to acquire technology, product or business; and\n\u2022\nacquired technologies, products or businesses may not perform as we expect, and we may fail to realize anticipated revenues and profits.\nIn addition, our acquisition strategy may divert management\u2019s attention away from our existing business, resulting in the loss of key customers or employees, and expose us to unanticipated problems or legal liabilities, including responsibility as a successor for undisclosed or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses or assets.\nIf we fail to conduct due diligence on our potential targets effectively, we may not identify problems at target companies or fail to recognize incompatibilities or other obstacles to successful integration. Our inability to successfully integrate future acquisitions could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could severely weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt and, if new technologies, products or businesses are not implemented effectively, may preclude the realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of new technologies, products or businesses may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities and competitive responses. The difficulties in integrating acquisitions include, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u2022\nintegrating the cultures of both companies;\n\u2022\nintegrating IT systems, internal control environments, accounting and back-office functions;\n\u2022\npreserving important strategic customer relationships;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating and integrating geographically separate organizations.\nIn addition, even if we integrate successfully the operations of an acquisition, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies or growth opportunities we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nFurther, acquisitions may cause us to:\n\u2022\nissue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentage;\n\u2022\nuse a substantial portion of our cash resources;\n\u2022\nincrease our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt or contingent consideration to pay for an acquisition;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities for which we do not have indemnification from the former owners, or we have disputed or uncollectible indemnification from the former owners;\n\u2022\nrecord goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges;\n\u2022\nexperience volatility in earnings due to changes in contingent consideration related to acquisition earn-out liability estimates;\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u2022\nlose existing or potential contracts as a result of conflict of interest issues;\n\u2022\nbecome subject to adverse tax consequences or deferred compensation charges;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs; or\n\u2022\nbecome subject to litigation.\nFurthermore, our acquisitions may not yield the value anticipated at the time of the acquisition, or may underperform.\nAttempts to enter new verticals may not be successful.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we attempt to enter new verticals, and offer new and innovative products and services. We have and intend to enter new verticals and launch new products both organically and through selective mergers and acquisitions. Our attempts to enter new verticals and launch new products and services may not be successful, costing us money and diverting management time and attention.\nOur customers may terminate many of our contracts on short notice without penalty, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomers may switch service providers without incurring significant expense relative to the annual cost of the service. Our contracts generally provide that in the event of prolonged loss of service or for other good reasons, our customers may terminate service without penalty. In addition, some of our contracts may be terminated by our customers for no reason and upon short notice. Terms of contracts typically vary with a range from short-term call out work to five years. Work orders placed under such agreements may have shorter terms than the relevant customer agreement. As a result, we may not be able to retain our customers through the end of the terms specified in the contracts, resulting in harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur updated credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. These ratios may limit our capacity to finance our growth strategy and operations. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facility, including as a result of events beyond our control, technical or other default could result, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions, including restricting the payment of cash dividends under default and maintaining certain financial covenants such as a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2019. The consolidated leverage ratio then decreases to 3.00 to 1.00 for three quarters as of June 30, 2020, and then decreases to 2.75 to 1.00 for all remaining quarters. If any default occurs related to these covenants that is not cured or waived, the unpaid principal and any accrued interest can be declared immediately due and payable. The facilities under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company.\nIf we approach our covenant limits, we will be limited in our ability to finance capital and operating expenditures and any acquisitions we may pursue in the future. Should this happen we would pursue additional financing, through either debt and / or equity offerings. We may incur financing and legal fees attempting to amend our current Credit Agreement, or in pursuing other debt and or equity financing. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur growth strategy may require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms.\nTo support our growth strategy, we expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures and may in the future make select acquisitions. Many of our customers now demand newer HTS services, requiring significant capital expenditures to upgrade equipment. We expect to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, if any, with cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or capital markets transactions; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or\nequity securities. The issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Furthermore, raising equity capital would generally dilute existing stockholders. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur strategy of moving up the technology stack entails entering new business lines that could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to move up the technology stack, that is to leverage our existing network to provide application layer solutions to our network customers. In 2017, we began reporting a new segment, Apps & IoT, to capture results from these new OTT services, such as SCADA, MetOcean, BlackTIE, CyphreLink and Advanced Video Intelligence. In addition, in 2018, we acquired Intelie which provides us a real-time machine-to-machine learning offering, Intelie LIVE. We continue to expect to invest in new lines of business, new products and other new initiatives to generate revenue. Our customers may not adopt some of our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Furthermore, efforts at establishing new lines of business could divert management attention from our core MCS network and Systems Integration businesses. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe rely on third parties, particularly satellite owners, to provide products and services for the operation of our business. Failures by third-party providers have caused, and in the future could cause, service interruptions, harm our business and reputation and result in loss of customers and revenue.\nA significant part of our operations and growth depends on third-party providers delivering reliable communications connections, networks, equipment, maintenance, repair and satellite transponder capacity, subjecting our business, reputation and customer revenue to risks beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\ntelecommunications, satellite manufacturing, equipment or control system errors, faults or failures;\n\u2022\nsaturation of communication connection points, networks and third-party facilities;\n\u2022\nin-orbit risks for satellites including malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris;\n\u2022\nlack of communication service alternatives, including failure of satellite providers to timely replace aging satellites with more modern technology and updated capacities;\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\npower loss;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\nunauthorized access or security risks; and\n\u2022\nsabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism or war.\nOur results in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were negatively impacted by certain satellite outages and interruptions by certain of our providers. These incidents caused RigNet to lose forecasted revenues and to experience increased costs as we had to make alternative arrangements for our customers. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer future satellite outages or that any potential future outage will not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Under most of our contracts with satellite service providers, our satellite service providers do not indemnify us for such loss or damage to our business resulting from certain risks, including satellite failures. If any potential claims result in liabilities, we could be required to pay damages or other penalties.\nIf we lose the right to use or upgrade any products or services provided by a third-party, our customers could experience delays or be unable to access our own services until we can obtain and integrate equivalent technology. There might not always be commercially reasonable hardware or software alternatives to the third-party infrastructure,\nproducts and services that we currently license for our operations. Any such alternatives could be more difficult or costly to replace than the third-party infrastructure, products and services we currently use, and integration of the alternatives into our operations could require significant work and substantial time and resources. Any delays or failures associated with our operations may injure our reputation with customers and potential customers and result in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure of our Line-of-Site network or loss of platform access could materially impact our results of operations.\nOur microwave network is a Line-of-Site (LOS) system that operates by relaying microwave communications from one microwave site to another that must be within visible sight. Furthermore, our LTE network is built on the existing infrastructure of our microwave network. We secure access to our customers\u2019 offshore platforms to house our LOS, microwave and LTE network, but the agreements are subject to termination for various reasons, including decommissioning of the platform. When a microwave site on a microwave relay is rendered inoperable subsequent dependent sites can also be rendered inoperable. As such the risk of a LOS, microwave or LTE site being rendered inoperable by weather, technical failure, loss of access to an operator\u2019s platform space or other means will likely negatively affect other dependent microwave sites. We do not insure for loss of a LOS, microwave or LTE site or business interruption caused by the loss of such a site as we believe the cost of such insurance outweighs the risk of potential loss, so the loss of a LOS, microwave or LTE site or any business interruption could require us to spend significant capital to restore network service and / or harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and export control laws that have stringent compliance standards.\nWe are subject to a number of applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States as well as comparable laws of other countries. We cannot provide services to or in certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control of the United States Department of the Treasury or the United States Department of Commerce unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations. If our customers move their sites into countries subject to certain sanctions, we may not be able to serve them, in which case, our revenues will be adversely impacted, and we may incur additional costs. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws that, generally, prohibit bribes or unreasonable gifts to governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, and more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. In certain countries, we engage third-party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in dealings with government officials, such as customs agents, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in penalties or sanctions being assessed against us.\nMany of our potential customers are resistant to new solutions and technologies, which may limit our growth.\nAlthough there is a strong focus on technology development within the oil and gas industry, some of the companies in the upstream oil and gas industry are relatively conservative and risk-averse with respect to adopting new solutions and technologies in the area of remote communications. As a result of the sustained downturn in oil and gas prices, many of our customers focus on price rather than the value new technologies bring them, further slowing the uptake of new solutions and technologies. Some drilling contractors, oil and gas companies and oilfield service providers may choose not to adopt new solutions and technology, such as our OTT offerings, which may limit our growth potential.\nSystems Integration projects are heavily dependent on cost, productivity, schedule and performance management.\nWe account for Systems Integration contracts using accounting rules for construction-type contracts. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include the price and availability of labor, equipment and materials, productivity, as well as the time necessary to obtain approvals and permits. If we make inaccurate estimates, or if we find errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, changes in local labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of equipment and materials, or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform, or changes in foreign exchange rates, then cost overruns may occur. We may be required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. In accordance with the accounting guidance, we would record a cumulative adjustment to reduce the margin previously recorded on the related project in the period a change in estimate is needed. If the contract is significant, or we encounter issues that impact multiple contracts, cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, Systems Integration contracts can require performance bonds, surety bonds and similar instruments. Any inability to secure required performance bonds, surety bonds and similar instruments, could limit business. Although we have not previously had performance bonds, surety bonds and similar instruments called, should such instruments be called in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of any of these customers would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we continue to diversify our customer base, we still receive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of large customers, among them being Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Valaris Plc, John Wood Group Plc, BP Plc, Baker Hughes Company, Seadrill Ltd., Bechtel Corporation, Halliburton Company, McDermott International, Chevron Corporation and Veripos Inc.. Although none of these customers represents more than 10% of our annual revenue, should one or more of these customers terminate or significantly reduce their business with us and we were not able to replace such revenue, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. As our top customers are concentrated in energy, should there be any adverse impact on the energy business that caused our customers to reduce demand for our services our financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nWe expect both product and pricing competition to persist and intensify. Increased competition could cause reduced revenue, price reductions, reduced profits and loss of market share. Our industry is characterized by competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology. Our primary global competitor is Speedcast International Ltd. Panasonic, through its ITC Global subsidiary, and Tampnet Inc. have begun to expand their presence as active providers of communications services to the oil and gas, mining and maritime markets. We also compete with regional competitors in the countries in which we operate. In addition, in certain markets outside of the U.S., we face competition from local competitors that provide their services at a lower price due to lower overhead costs, including lower costs of complying with applicable government regulations and their willingness to provide services for a lower profit margin. Furthermore, in the Apps and IoT space we compete with IBM, Microsoft, Google, Kongsberg Gruppen and other smaller pure-play companies, as well as large, established oilfield technology providers like Schlumberger and Haliburton. Additionally, in the SI space, we compete primarily with Speedcast and ABB Ltd and other construction contractors. Strong competition and significant investments by competitors to develop new and better solutions may make it difficult for us to maintain our customer base, force us to reduce our prices or increase our costs to develop new solutions.\nFurthermore, competition may emerge from companies that we have not previously perceived as competitors or consolidation of our industry may cause existing competitors to become bigger and stronger with more resources, market awareness and market share. For example, we have experienced customer projects where we have bid directly against some of our satellite bandwidth providers, either acting alone or in conjunction with one of our direct competitors. Competition with our satellite bandwidth providers, either alone or in restrictive arrangements with our suppliers or competitors may materially and adversely affect the availability and pricing of our products and services.\nAs we expand into new markets, we may experience increased competition from some of our competitors that have prior experience or other business in these markets or geographic regions. In addition, some of our customers may decide to insource some of the MCS solutions that we provide, in particular our terrestrial communication services (e.g., Line-of-Site (LOS) or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)), which do not require the same level of maintenance and support as our other services. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competitive forces, to adapt to technological advances, to develop more advanced services and solutions more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors, to continue to develop and deepen our global sales and business development network, and to educate potential customers about the benefits of using our solutions rather than our competitors\u2019 services or in-sourced solutions. Our failure to successfully respond to these competitive challenges could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations are subject to additional or different risks than our United States operations, which may harm our business and financial results.\nWe operate in many countries around the world, including countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Europe and intend to continue to expand the number of countries in which we operate. However, because operations in some countries may be temporary, the total number of countries in which we operate fluctuates. There are many risks inherent in conducting business internationally that are in addition to or different than those affecting our United States operations, including:\n\u2022\nforeign laws and regulations that may be vague or arbitrary, lack traditional concepts of due process, and be subject to unexpected changes or interpretations, resulting in difficulty enforcing contracts or timely collection of receivables;\n\u2022\ntariffs, import and export restrictions and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically dispersed operations and culturally diverse work forces in countries with varying employment laws and practices including restrictions on terminating employees;\n\u2022\nincreased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuation and currency controls;\n\u2022\npotential political and economic instability, which may include military conflict, nationalization or expropriation;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expense of maintaining international sales distribution channels; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining and protecting our intellectual property.\nThe authorities in the countries where we operate may introduce additional regulations for the oil and gas and communications industries. New rules and regulations may be enacted, or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to provide our services. Recently, some of our foreign telecommunications regulators have adopted new interpretations of existing regulations when we have renewed our licenses, causing increased costs in certain jurisdictions. Future amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities in the oil and gas industry and telecommunications industry could harm our operations and financial results. Compliance with and changes in tax laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect our operating results.\nCompliance related tax issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries. Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities, disagreements with taxing authorities over our tax positions and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct, or if we conduct, business in the affected countries.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure or inability to sufficiently protect them could harm our business and our operating results.\nWe own, and maintain certain intellectual property assets, including patents, patent applications, copyrights and trademarks, trade secrets, and rights to certain domain names, which we believe are collectively among our most valuable assets. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through the laws of the U.S. and other countries of the world, and through contractual provisions. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property assets and proprietary rights might not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of those rights. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced.\nInternal restructuring activities may negatively impact the Company.\nReductions in resources may adversely affect or delay various sales, marketing, product development and operational activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Additionally, restructuring activities could have negative effects on our internal control over financial reporting and employee morale.\nInformation technology infrastructure and systems are critical to supporting our operations, accounting and internal controls; any potential failure of our information technology infrastructure or systems could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe continue to update and enhance our information systems. If a problem occurs that impairs or compromises this infrastructure, systems upgrades and/or new systems implementations; the resulting disruption could impede our ability to perform accounting, invoice, process orders, generate management reports or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue and could require us to incur significant expenses to remediate. Additionally, any such events could adversely harm our legal, accounting and compliance capabilities including but not limited to: our ability to (i) timely file reports with the SEC; (ii) maintain effectiveness of internal control; (iii) timely file financial statements required by certain statutes; (iv) timely file compliance reports with our lenders under our credit agreement; and (v) timely file income taxes with the IRS, foreign taxing authorities, and local taxing authorities.\nSevere weather in the Gulf of Mexico or other areas where we operate could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain areas in and near the Gulf of Mexico and other areas in which our clients operate experience unfavorable weather conditions, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions, on a relatively frequent basis. A major storm or threat of a major storm in these areas may harm our business. Our clients\u2019 drilling rigs, production platforms and other vessels in these areas are susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms, which may cause them to no longer need our communication services. Our equipment on these rigs, platforms or vessels could be damaged causing us to have service interruptions and lose business or incur significant costs for the replacement of such equipment. Even the threat of a very large storm will sometimes cause our clients to limit activities in an area and thus harm our business. Changing weather conditions could impair satellite connectivity, cause more sites to be shut down and generally cause activities to be limited so that our business may be harmed. This risk is more pronounced for LOS microwave service, as there is a likely loss of service for multiple subsequent microwave sites in the network relay.\nChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.\nOur U.S. services are provided on a private carrier basis. As such, these services are subject to light or no regulation by the FCC and state PUCs. If the FCC or one or more PUCs or any other telecommunications regulator determine that these services or the services of our subsidiaries or affiliates constitute common carrier offerings or change the regulations applicable to private carriers, we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of those laws and regulations. We may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties if we fail to comply with those requirements.\nOur international operations are also regulated by various non-U.S. governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards and requirements. The adoption of new laws or regulations, changes to the existing regulatory framework, new interpretations of the laws that apply to our operations, or the loss of, or a material limitation on, any of our material licenses could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Recently, some of our foreign telecommunications regulators have adopted new interpretations of existing regulations when we have renewed our licenses, causing increased costs in certain jurisdictions.\nThe FCC is considering reallocating 6 GHZ technology to allow unlicensed use of this spectrum. Much of our Gulf of Mexico backbone network traffic is carried over 6 GHZ spectrum which we own. Unlicensed use of this spectrum could interfere with our client\u2019s safety critical communications and degrade our overall network performance. Any such interference or degradation of performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we infringe, or if third parties assert that we infringe, third-party intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs and incur significant harm to our business.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us, which could result in substantial damages if it is ultimately determined that our services infringe a third-party\u2019s proprietary rights. Even if claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from our other business concerns.\nMany of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries that may make them difficult or expensive to interpret or enforce.\nMany of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries other than the U.S., which may create both legal and practical difficulties in case of a dispute or conflict. We operate in regions where the ability to protect contractual and other legal rights may be limited. In addition, having to pursue arbitration or litigation in some countries may be more difficult or expensive than pursuing litigation in the United States.\nSome of our stockholders could exert control over the Company.\nAs of February 28, 2020, funds associated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 25.0% of our outstanding voting power and have a seat on our board of directors. Additionally, as of February 28, 2020, funds associated with FMR, LLC, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 14.8% of our outstanding voting power, and funds associated with Arrowmark Colorado Holding, LLC, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 14.2% of our outstanding voting power. As a result, any of these stockholders could potentially exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election or removal of our directors and change of control transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and limitations on the expatriation or conversion of currencies, which may result in significant financial charges, increased costs of operations or decreased demand for our services and solutions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, 9.4% of our revenues were earned in non-U.S. currencies, while a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures and all of our outstanding debt, was priced in U.S. dollars. In addition, we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material effect on our reported earnings or the value of our assets. In the future, a greater portion of our revenues may be earned in non-U.S. currencies, increasing this risk of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nAny depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which we conduct business may result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may, at the same time, decrease demand for our services and solutions in the affected markets. If our operating companies distribute dividends in local currencies in the future, the amount of cash we receive will also be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, some of the countries in which we have operations do or may restrict the expatriation or conversion of currency making such cash unavailable for financing of our global operations and capital investments.\nFurthermore, a majority of our cash balances are held outside of the United States. Repatriating cash to the United States can require paying taxes in one or more countries making the cash available to us less than that reported in our financial statements.\nThe average daily trading volume of our common stock is low, which can cause price volatility unrelated to our actual operations and performance.\nThe average daily trading volume of our common stock in 2019 was approximately 49 thousand shares. Due to the low trading volume, our common stock may be subject to more market volatility than other more liquid stocks, without regard to our performance. Stock price volatility and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our stockholders to losses and subject us to takeover bids or lead to action by NASDAQ. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nquarterly announcements and variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors, either alone or in comparison to analysts\u2019 expectations or prior Company estimates, including announcements of site counts, rates of churn, loss of a material customer, and operating margins that would result in downward pressure on our stock price;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability or perceived availability of additional capital and market perceptions relating to our access to this capital;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products or technologies;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts or changes in their estimates concerning us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets;\n\u2022\nany significant change in our board of directors or management; and\n\u2022\nperceptions of general market conditions in the technology and communications and oil and gas industries, the U.S. economy and global market conditions.\nIn addition, we have little research analyst coverage which could lead to less independent analysis for stockholders.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and, as such, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, (i.e. a company with less than $250 million of public float) and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our smaller reporting company status. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 12494, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "RNET"}
