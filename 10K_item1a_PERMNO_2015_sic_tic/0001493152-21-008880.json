RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investing in shares of our common stock involves risks. Before making a decision to invest in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks that are described below, in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other information that we file from time to time with the SEC that is incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should also read the sections entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 4 of this prospectus. The risks described in the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial could also materially and adversely affect us. You should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in shares of our common stock and the suitability of investing in our shares in light of your particular circumstances. If any of the risks contained in this Annual Report develop into actual events, our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, long-term performance goals, prospects, and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Some statements in this Annual Report, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. See the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our shareholders.\nWe were incorporated on July 18, 2017, and therefore, have a relatively limited operating history. Despite the experience and track record of our management team in the entertainment and packaging industries, historical results are not indicative of, and may be substantially different than, the results we achieve in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our business successfully or implement our operating policies and strategies. The results of our operations depend on several factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, the availability of adequate short and long-term financing, conditions in the financial markets, and general economic conditions. In addition, our future operating results and financial data may vary materially from the historical operating results and financial data as well as the pro forma operating results and financial data because of a number of factors, including costs and expenses associated with being a public company.\nWe have a history of losses and we may never achieve profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our operations lost $7,902,347 of which $4,623,130 was non-cash and $1,131,975 related to restructuring, severance, transaction costs and non-recurring items. At December 31, 2020, we had total current assets of $5,342,183 and current liabilities of $11,285,663 resulting in negative working capital of $5,943,480. At December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $28,028,207 and total liabilities of $14,505,506 resulting in stockholders\u2019 equity of $13,522,701.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our operations lost approximately $14,196,154 of which approximately $8,064,101 was non-cash and approximately $364,320 related to restructuring, severance, transaction costs and non-recurring items. At December 31, 2019, we had total current assets of $4,955,365 and current liabilities of $12,973,319 resulting in negative working capital of $8,017,954, of which approximately $4,015,484 related to unsecured trade payables assumed in our Cloud B acquisition. In February 2019, our consolidating subsidiary, CBAV1, LLC, foreclosed on its promissory note it held that was secured by Cloud B, Inc.\u2019s assets making any payments of the Cloud B trade payables unlikely. Subsequently in February 2020, we sold Cloud B, Inc. and the buyer assumed the liabilities in exchange for the issuance of 150,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2019, we had total assets of $23,609,619 and total liabilities of $16,155,187 resulting in stockholders\u2019 equity of $7,454,432.\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability of replacements to quickly and successfully perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the leadership and experience of our relatively small number of key executive management personnel, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher B. Ferguson, our President and Treasurer, Kevin J. Ferguson, and our Chief Financial Officer, Brett Vroman. The loss of the services of any of these key executives or any of our executive management members could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace such personnel on a timely basis or without incurring increased costs, or at all. Furthermore, if we lose or terminate the services of one or more of our key employees or if one or more of our current or former executives or key employees joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us, it could impair our business and our ability to successfully implement our business plan. Additionally, if we are unable to hire qualified replacements for our executive and other key positions in a timely fashion, our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed. Even if we can quickly hire qualified replacements, we would expect to experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies during any transition. We believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. There is a high level of competition for experienced, successful personnel in our industry. Our inability to meet our executive staffing requirements in the future could impair our growth and harm our business.\nOur financial statements may be materially affected if our estimates prove to be inaccurate as a result of our limited experience in making critical accounting estimates.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we face the risk that charges to income will be required. In addition, because we have limited to no operating history and limited experience in making these estimates, judgments, and assumptions, the risk of future charges to income may be greater than if we had more experience in these areas. Any such charges could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our securities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2009-\u2009Critical accounting policies\u2009-\u2009Use of estimates\u201d for a discussion of the accounting estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may require additional financing to sustain or grow our operations.\nOur growth will be dependent on our ability to access additional equity and debt capital. Moreover, part of our business strategy may involve the use of debt financing to increase potential revenues. Our inability in the future to obtain additional equity capital or a corporate credit facility on attractive terms, or at all, could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our growth prospects and future shareholder returns.\nIf we fail to manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nAs we seek to advance our product lines, we will need to expand our development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. We anticipate that a period of significant expansion will be required to address potential growth and to handle licensing of additional product categories, such as more arts and crafts focused items. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must establish appropriate and scalable operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls and establish a qualified finance, administrative, and operations staff. As a public company, we will have to implement internal controls to comply with government-mandated regulations. Our management may be unable to hire, train, retain, motivate, and manage the necessary personnel or to identify, manage, and exploit potential strategic relationships and market opportunities. Our failure to manage growth effectively could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy includes pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of additional brands, and we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully operate or integrate any brands that we may acquire.\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to opportunistically acquire new brands and product concepts, just as we acquired TBD Safety, LLC in 2020. Although we believe that opportunities for other, future acquisitions may be available from time to time, competition for acquisition candidates may exist or increase in the future. Consequently, there may be fewer acquisition opportunities available to us as well as higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, manage, or successfully integrate additional companies, brands, or product concepts without substantial costs, delays, or operational or financial problems. In the event we are able to acquire additional companies, brands, or other product concepts, the integration and operation of such acquisitions in addition to the on-going integration and operation of the Company may place significant demands on our management, which could adversely affect our ability to manage our business. We may be required to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.\nAcquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, and that is likely to continue in the future. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product concepts and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brands. In reviewing potential acquisitions or investments, we target brands, assets or companies that we believe offer attractive products or offerings, the ability for us to leverage our offerings, opportunities to drive our brands, competencies, or other synergies.\nThe combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process that will require significant management attention and resources. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would limit the expected benefits of the acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. The overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u25cf difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u25cf difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u25cf conforming standards, controls, procedures, accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structures between the two companies.\nWe cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or to grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business.\nAn inability to develop and introduce products in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to bring products to market and meet customer demands before they begin to lose interest in a given product. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source, and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers\u2019 increasingly compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. Moreover, unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, and manufacturing delays or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated. They may also reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.\nWe have debt financing arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future and may impair our ability to react quickly to changes in our business.\nOur exposure to debt financing could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business, and impair our competitive position. For example, it could:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate future cash flows to the repayment of debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could materially increase the impact of these risks on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn times of tough economic conditions, the Company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting de-stocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets. Such distributor de-stocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession. The Company\u2019s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments. Further, the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s future results.\nOur ability to repay our debt depends on many factors beyond our control. If we elect to raise equity capital in the future, our current shareholders could be subjected to significant dilution. If we are unable to raise capital in the future, we may seek other avenues to fund the business, including sale/leaseback arrangements or seeking to sell assets of all, or a portion of, our operations.\nPayments on our debt will depend on our ability to generate cash or secure additional financing in the future. This ability, to an extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and sufficient future financing is not available to us, we may not be able to repay our debt, operate our business or fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot meet or refinance our obligations when they become due, we may be required to attempt to raise capital, reduce expenditures, or take other actions which we may be unable to successfully complete or, even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on us. If such sources of capital are not available or not available on sufficiently favorable terms, we may seek other avenues to fund the business, including sale/leaseback arrangements or seeking to sell assets of all or a portion of our operations. If we decide to raise capital in the equity markets or take other actions, our shareholders could incur significant dilution or diminished valuations, or if we are unable to raise capital, our ability to effectively operate our business could be impaired. In addition, if we are successful in raising capital in the equity markets to repay our indebtedness or for any other purpose in the future, our shareholders could incur significant dilution.\nOur success will depend on the reliability and performance of third-party distributors, manufacturers, and suppliers.\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of third-party suppliers for components. Certain of these competing companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage in seeking to procure production capacity. Our inability to contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers to provide a sufficient supply of our products on acceptable terms and on a timely basis could negatively impact our relationships with existing customers and cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities with potential customers. We also rely on operators and distributors to market and distribute our products. If our operators or distributors are unsuccessful, we may miss revenue-generating opportunities that might otherwise have been recognized.\nWe are dependent on a small number of key suppliers and customers. Changes in our relationships with these parties or changes in the economic environments in which they operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur revenues are concentrated with a small number of customers. We do not have long-term agreements with our customers, and instead develop our products on an item-by-item basis subject to purchase orders from customers. No assurances can be given that our customers will continue to submit purchase orders for new products.\nTo manufacture our products, we purchase components from independent manufacturers, many of whom are located in Asia. An extended interruption in the supply of these products or suitable substitute inventory would disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor a number of our key inventory components, we rely on two China-based suppliers, Pokar Industrial Ltd., and MJR Corporation. These suppliers have discussed the possibility of entering into a joint venture at an undetermined time in the future, whereby they would consolidate their operations and conduct such operations from a single location. As we are currently transitioning the manufacturing of more of our components to these suppliers, our increased dependence on them could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations if the consolidation of their operations results in a diminished capacity to timely produce our components. We cannot estimate with any certainty the length of time that would be required to establish alternative supply relationships, or whether the quantity or quality of materials that could be so obtained would be sufficient. Furthermore, we may incur additional costs in sourcing materials from alternative producers. The disruption of our inventory supply, even in the short term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak caused disruptions in our manufacturing operations, which resulted in delays in the shipment of products to certain of our customers and ultimately, a suspension of our Asian operations in January 2020. A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the manufacturing, delivery and assembly process within any of our production facilities could continue to result in delays in the shipment of products to our customers, increased costs and reduced revenue.\nChanges in customer preferences, the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers, inventory reductions by customers, and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has certain significant customers. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s largest customer comprised approximately 7% of net sales. The loss or material reduction of business, the lack of success of sales initiatives, or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the Company\u2019s products, related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the Company\u2019s major customers are volume purchasers, a few of which are much larger than the Company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers. This limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices. Furthermore, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on net sales.\nIf customers are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered, the Company\u2019s attrition rates may increase. In periods of increasing attrition rates, recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty, as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the Company provides.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted with customers and suppliers located outside of the United States. Currency, economic, health related, and other risks associated with our international operations in China and Japan could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur international customers and suppliers are concentrated in China and Japan. Our revenues from international customers, and our inventory costs from international suppliers are exposed to the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange rates, local economic conditions, health related conditions, and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. To the extent that our revenues and purchases from international business partners increase in the future, our exposure to changes in foreign economic conditions and currency fluctuations will increase.\nFor example, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations upon China by the United States or the European Union, or the loss of \u201cnormal trade relations\u201d status with China, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of a health-related crisis such as COVID-19, which emerged in China where many of the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers are located. COVID-19 has been expanding within Asia and globally, such that the Company\u2019s operations in Asia have been largely suspended since January 2020. Additionally, the suspension of manufacturing operations by government inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to import products from China. Furthermore, Japanese economic policies are subject to rapid change and the government of Japan may adopt policies which have the effect of hindering private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance that the government of Japan will not significantly alter its policies from time to time without notice in a manner which reduces or eliminates any benefits from its present policies of economic reform.\nBesides the risks discussed above, our dependence on foreign customers and suppliers also means that we may be affected by changes in the relative value of the U.S. Dollar to foreign currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen. Although our receipts from foreign customers and our purchases of foreign products are principally negotiated and paid for in U.S. Dollars, a portion of our business is denominated in other currencies and changes in the applicable currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of our customers and vendors. This, in turn, might cause such vendors to demand higher prices, delay shipments, or discontinue selling to us. This also might cause such customers to demand lower prices, delay, or discontinue purchases of our products or demand other changes to the terms of our relationships. These situations could in turn ultimately reduce our revenues or increase our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, which could cause fluctuations in the price of our securities.\nWe are subject to the following factors that may negatively affect our operating results:\n\u25cf the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf technical difficulties;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;\n\u25cf our ability to identify and enter into relationships with appropriate and qualified third-party providers for necessary development and manufacturing services;\n\u25cf regulation by federal, state, or local governments;\n\u25cf general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions specific to the entertainment, party items, arts and crafts, and packaging industries;\n\u25cf the announcement of our entrance into a business combination or acquisition of a second company that has a material effect on us; and\n\u25cf Various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nAs a result of our lack of any operating history and the nature of the markets in which we compete, it is difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately. As a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain decisions concerning expenditures, pricing, service, or marketing that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions, which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials, component parts, freight, energy, labor, and sourced finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe Company\u2019s products are manufactured using both ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to, steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum, and nickel. Additionally, the Company uses other commodity-based materials for components and packaging including, but not limited to, plastics, resins, wood, and corrugated products. The Company\u2019s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight, energy, and labor. The Company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors. If the Company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its profitability may be adversely affected.\nConversely, in the event there is deflation, the Company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices, and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to reduce its cost base (through negotiations with suppliers or other measures) to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions, the Company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the Company in order to fulfill their obligations. In a limited number of circumstances, the magnitude of the Company\u2019s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts, or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies, or an inability to market products. Changes in value-added tax rebates, currently available to the Company or to its suppliers, could also increase the costs of the Company\u2019s manufactured products, as well as purchased products and components, and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nIn addition, many of the Company\u2019s products incorporate battery technology. As other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products, the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the Company\u2019s supply chain. In addition, increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the Company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials. If the Company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints or related increased costs, its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nLow demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the Company\u2019s performance and prospects for future growth.\nThe Company\u2019s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as market demand and costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis. Introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the Company than that of the technology replaced. That increase in costs, which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors, such as the failure to accurately predict market demand, end-user preferences, evolving industry standards, or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies. Moreover, the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the Company\u2019s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. The Company\u2019s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential cyberattacks, security problems, or other disruption and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, billing, and operating data. We may purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems will depend, and we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of confidential operator and other customer information. We depend upon the secure transmission of this information over public networks. Our networks and storage applications could be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or others through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means, or may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. In some cases, it will be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, interruption, or leakage of information from our systems could harm our reputation and business.\nIn addition, the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our or our brands\u2019 reputations. Employees or others might disclose non-public sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels, including through the use of social media. The continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks.\nChanges in laws or regulations governing our operations, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, cash flow, or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by laws and regulations at the local, state, and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nArticle XIII of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation designates the courts of the State of Nevada as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, and therefore may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to choose a forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nArticle XIII of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the courts of the State of Nevada shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s shareholders, (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes or the Company\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation or Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (as either might be amended from time to time), or (d) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nWe believe the choice-of-forum provision in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide will help provide for the orderly, efficient, and cost-effective resolution of Nevada-law issues affecting us by designating courts located in the State of Nevada (our state of incorporation) as the exclusive forum for cases involving such issues. However, this provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents, which may discourage such actions against us and our directors, officers, employees, and agents. While there is no Nevada case law addressing the enforceability of this type of provision, Nevada courts have on prior occasion found persuasive authority in Delaware case law in the absence of Nevada statutory or case law specifically addressing an issue of corporate law. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware ruled in June 2013 that choice-of-forum provisions of a type similar to those included in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide are not facially invalid under corporate law and constitute valid and enforceable contractual forum selection clauses. However, if a court were to find the choice-of-forum provision in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe could face substantial competition, which could reduce our market share and negatively impact our net revenue.\nThere are a number of companies that manufacture and distribute products similar to ours. Many of our anticipated competitors are significantly larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our net revenue, and increase our costs.\nOur long-term success will depend to some degree on our ability to protect the proprietary technology that we have developed or may develop or acquire in the future. Patent applications can take many years to issue, and we can provide no assurance that any such patents would be issued. If we are denied any or all of these patents, we may not be able to successfully prevent our competitors from imitating our products or using some or all of the processes that are the subject of such patent applications. Such imitation may lead to increased competition within the finite market for products such as ours. Even if our pending patents were to be issued, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently comprehensive to prevent our competitors from developing similar competitive products. Although we may aggressively pursue anyone whom we reasonably believe is infringing upon our intellectual property rights, initiating and maintaining suits against third parties that may infringe upon our intellectual property rights will require substantial financial resources, especially given our lack of patent registrations and applications. We may not have the financial resources to bring such suits, and if we do bring such suits, we may not prevail. Regardless of our success in any such actions, we could incur significant expenses in connection with such suits.\nThird-party claims of infringement against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties.\nEspecially given that we produce products for licensed properties, we are susceptible to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause us to incur substantial costs, pay substantial damages, or prohibit us from distributing our products. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware, which later may result in issued patents that our products may infringe. If any of our products infringe a valid patent, we could be prevented from distributing that product unless and until we can obtain a license or redesign it to avoid infringement. A license may not be available or may require us to pay substantial royalties. We also may not be successful in any attempt to redesign the product to avoid any infringement. Infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate, and we may not have the financial and human resources to defend ourselves against any infringement suits that may be brought against us.\nOur brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators, or the failure of our licensees or vendors to comply with our product quality, manufacturing requirements, marketing standards, and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation.\nOur trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position. Unauthorized use of our trademark rights may not only erode sales of our products, but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation, interfere with our ability to effectively represent ourselves to our customers, contractors, suppliers, and/or licensees, and increase litigation costs. Similarly, failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to our standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue, increased litigation, and/or damage to our reputation and business. There can be no assurance that our ongoing efforts to protect our brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with our licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations.\nDefects in our products could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, burden our engineering, and marketing resources, involve us in litigation and adversely affect us.\nOur success will depend on our ability to avoid, detect, and correct defects in our products. We may not be able to maintain products that are free from defects. Although we have taken steps to prevent defects, our products could suffer such defects. The occurrence of such defects or malfunctions could result in physical harm to the patrons of our customers and the subsequent termination of agreements, cancellation of orders, product returns, and diversion of our resources. Even if our customers do not suffer financial losses, customers may replace our products if they do not perform according to expectations. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and/or loss of sales. In addition, the occurrence of defects in our products may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other disciplinary action by regulatory authorities that could include suspension or revocation of our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nLow demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact our performance and prospects for future growth.\nOur competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as market demand and costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis. Introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to us than that of the technology replaced. That increase in costs, which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost, could adversely affect our results of operations. Market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors, such as the failure to accurately predict market demand, end-user preferences, evolving industry standards, or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies. Moreover, the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on our ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. Our investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met.\nOur products could be recalled.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall, repair or replacement of our products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. A recall could increase costs and adversely impact our reputation.\nOur business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the novel respiratory illness coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel respiratory illness COVID-19 a pandemic. The new strain of COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat. The outbreak of COVID-19 emerged in China, where many of the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers are located. COVID-19 has been expanding within Asia and globally, such that the Company\u2019s operations in Asia have been largely suspended since January 2020.\nAny outbreak of such epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments may materially and adversely affect the global economy, our markets and our business. In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak caused disruptions in our manufacturing operations, which resulted in delays in the shipment of products to certain of our customers and ultimately, a suspension of our Asian operations in January 2020. A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the manufacturing, delivery and assembly process within any of our production facilities could continue to result in delays in the shipment of products to our customers, increased costs and reduced revenue.\nWe cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook for consumer sales, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face potential business disruptions and related risks resulting from the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 outbreak has grown into a global pandemic that has impacted Asia, United States, Europe and other countries throughout the world. Financial markets have been experiencing extreme fluctuations that may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the credit markets react to the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence. The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. As a result, businesses have closed and limits have been placed on travel. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nWe are monitoring the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, and if COVID-19 continues to spread globally, including in the United States, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact the development of our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf the uncertainty that our contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time;\n\u25cf the impact of social distancing on our business;\n\u25cf delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf the undetermined costs reopening our subsidiaries to remain within local, state and federal guidelines that may ultimately effect our sales;\n\u25cf the majority of our retail customers have been unable to sell our products in their stores due to government-mandated closures and have temporarily reduced orders for our products;\n\u25cf the pandemic has reduced foot traffic in the stores where our products are sold that remain open, and the global economic impact of the pandemic has reduced consumer demand for our products generally; and\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party suppliers in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain. Any manufacturing supply interruption of materials could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future research and testing activities.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nRisks Associated with an Investment in our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders maintain the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to shareholders for approval.\nAs of April 9, 2021, our executive officers, directors, and shareholders who owned more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own 42,251,557 shares of common stock, or instruments convertible into common stock, representing approximately 68.34% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, if these shareholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other shareholders may desire. Please see ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS for further information.\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly.\nThe capital and credit markets have recently experienced a period of extreme volatility and disruption. The market price and liquidity of the market for shares may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our shares include:\n\u25cf our actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity, or changes in business strategy or prospects;\n\u25cf equity issuances by us, or share resales by our shareholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;\n\u25cf loss of a major funding source;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated accounting problems;\n\u25cf publication of research reports about us, or the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we incur in the future;\n\u25cf the announcement of our entrance into a business combination or acquisition of a second company that has a material effect on us;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions, trends including inflationary concerns, and the current state of the credit and capital markets;\n\u25cf significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u25cf changes in law, regulatory policies or tax guidelines, or interpretations thereof;\n\u25cf any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\n\u25cf operating performance of companies comparable to us;\n\u25cf short-selling pressure with respect to shares of our shares generally;\n\u25cf uncertainty surrounding the strength of the United States economic recovery; and\n\u25cf concerns regarding the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nAs noted above, market factors unrelated to our performance could also negatively impact the market price of our shares. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our shares is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in the capital markets can affect the market value of our shares. For instance, if interest rates rise, it is likely that the market price of our shares will decrease as market rates on interest-bearing securities increase.\nShares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our shares. We may issue additional shares in subsequent public offerings or private placements to make new investments or for other purposes. We are not required to offer any such shares to existing shareholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, it may not be possible for existing shareholders to participate in such future share issuances, which may dilute the existing shareholders\u2019 interests in us.\nIf we take advantage of specified reduced disclosure requirements applicable to an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, the information that we provide to shareholders may be different than they might receive from other public companies.\nAs a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. The Company has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards but does still have reduced reporting requirements. These provisions include:\n\u25cf only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;\n\u25cf no non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and\n\u25cf exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues, we have more than $700 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates, or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules and regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us may be harmed.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information that it is required to disclose in reports that the Company files with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Exchange Act rules and regulations. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with the rules and regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley or new or changed laws, regulations, and standards may differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice. Regulatory authorities may investigate transactions disclosed in our \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and if legal proceedings are initiated against us, it may harm our business.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain all of our future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business, and therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We believe it is likely that our board of directors will continue to conclude, that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to retain all earnings (if any) for the development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.\nPursuant to the Articles of Merger, filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on September 7, 2019, our board of directors has the right, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, and could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change of control. The possible negative impact on takeover attempts as a result of the issuance of such preferred stock could also adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOn October 16, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation (the \u201cDesignation\u201d) with the Secretary of State of Nevada, which designates 1,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Designation, holders of the Series B shall be entitled to dividends, a liquidation preference and shall have conversion rights. Each share of Series B shall be convertible into 1 share of Common Stock, on or after the twelve-month anniversary of the Original Issue Date at the option of the Holder thereof, for a total not to exceed 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The holders of the Series B shall have no voting rights.\nOn February 2, 2021, the Company filed an Amendment to the Certificate of Designation (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) for the Company\u2019s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d). Under the Amendment, each share of Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on all matters voted on by the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single class with other shares entitled to vote at all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation. With respect to any such vote, each share of Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock are then convertible (the \u201cConversion Shares\u201d). Such right may be exercised at any annual meeting or special meeting, or pursuant to any written consent of stockholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price, and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no or too few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership in us and may adversely affect us or the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock up to the authorized number of shares set forth in our charter. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee stock incentive plans, employee stock grants, or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. We cannot predict the size of any such future issuances or the effect, if any, that any such future issuances will have on the trading price of our common stock. Any such future issuances of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock may have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business and operations. If the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management, which could materially adversely affect our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, long-term performance goals, prospects, and results of operations.\nBecause the risk factors referred to above, as well as other risks not mentioned above, could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which ones will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 17826, "SIC": 3942, "TIC": "EDNT"}
