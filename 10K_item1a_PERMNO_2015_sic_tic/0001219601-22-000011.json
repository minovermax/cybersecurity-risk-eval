RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report and in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" the following are some of the important factors that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Business and Industry\nThe Company's profits will decline if the price of raw materials or energy rises and it cannot increase the price of its products, and the Company's financial results could be adversely affected if the Company was not able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials.\nThe Company uses various raw materials, such as aluminum, steel, tin, water, natural gas, electricity and other processed energy, as well as materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene resins, in its manufacturing operations. Sufficient quantities of these raw materials may not be available in the future or may be available\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nonly at increased prices. The Company's raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with aluminum contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum ingot costs and steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices. The availability of various raw materials and their prices depends on global and local supply and demand forces, governmental regulations (including tariffs and duties), level of production, resource availability, transportation, and other factors, including natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, in recent years the consolidation of steel suppliers, shortage of raw materials affecting the production of steel and the increased global demand for steel, including in China and other developing countries, have contributed to an overall tighter supply for steel, resulting in increased steel prices and, in some cases, special surcharges and allocated cut backs of products by steel suppliers. In addition, new tariffs and potential limits on steel supply in the U.S. from certain foreign countries could further negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of steel at competitive prices. Moreover, future steel supply contracts may provide for prices that fluctuate or adjust rather than provide a fixed price during a one-year period. As a result of continuing global supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Company's business may increase as well, including natural gas, electricity and freight-related costs.\nThe prices of certain raw materials used by the Company, such as aluminum, steel resins and processed energy, have historically been subject to volatility. In 2021, consumption of aluminum and steel represented 43% and 8% of the Company's consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. While certain, but not all, of the Company's contracts pass through raw material costs to customers, the Company may be unable to increase its prices to offset increases in raw material costs without suffering reductions in unit volume, revenue and operating income. In addition, any price increases may take effect after related cost increases, reducing operating income in the near term. Significant increases in raw material costs may increase the Company's working capital requirements, which may increase the Company's average outstanding indebtedness and interest expense and may exceed the amounts available under the Company's senior secured credit facilities and other sources of liquidity. In addition, the Company hedges raw material costs on behalf of certain customers and may suffer losses if such customers are unable to satisfy their purchase obligations.\nIf the Company is unable to purchase aluminum, steel, resins or other raw materials for a significant period of time, the Company's operations would be disrupted and any such disruption may adversely affect the Company's financial results. If customers believe that the Company's competitors have greater access to raw materials, perceived certainty of supply at the Company's competitors may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage regarding pricing and product volumes.\nThe Company's principal markets may be subject to overcapacity and intense competition, which could reduce the Company's net sales and net income.\nBeverage and food cans are standardized products, allowing for relatively little differentiation among competitors. This could lead to overcapacity and price competition among beverage and food can producers if capacity growth outpaced the growth in demand for beverage and food cans and overall manufacturing capacity exceeded demand. These market conditions could reduce product prices and contribute to declining revenue and net income. Competitive pricing pressures, overcapacity, the failure to develop new product designs and technologies for products, as well as other factors, such as consolidation among the Company's competitors, could cause the Company to lose existing business or opportunities to generate new business and could result in decreased cash flow and net income.\nThe Company is subject to competition from substitute products and decreases in demand for its products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to substantial competition from producers of alternative packaging made from glass, paper, flexible materials and plastic. The Company's sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by the Company's customers in the beverage and food markets. Changes in preferences for products and packaging by consumers of beverage cans and prepackaged food cans significantly influence the Company's sales. Changes in packaging by the Company's customers may require the Company to re-tool manufacturing operations, which could require material expenditures. In addition, a decrease in the costs of, or a further increase in consumer demand for, alternative packaging could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows for the Company. For example, increases in the price of aluminum and steel and decreases in the price of plastic resin, which is a petrochemical product and may fluctuate with prices in the oil and gas market, may increase substitution of plastic food and beverage containers for metal containers or increases in the price of steel may increase substitution of aluminum packaging for aerosol products. Moreover, due to its high percentage of fixed costs, the Company may be unable to maintain its gross margin at past levels if it is not able to achieve high capacity utilization rates for its production equipment. In periods of low worldwide demand for its products or in situations where industry expansion created excess capacity, the Company experiences relatively low capacity utilization rates in its operations, which can lead to reduced margins during that period and can have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nThe Company's business results depend on its ability to understand its customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand.\nThe Company's ability to develop new product offerings for a diverse group of global customers with differing preferences, while maintaining functionality and spurring innovation, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of the Company's existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potential high developing markets, including South America, Eastern Europe and Asia (including India). Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's business.\nLoss of third-party transportation providers upon whom the Company depends or increases in fuel prices could increase the Company's costs or cause a disruption in the Company's operations.\nThe Company depends generally upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of products to customers. Strikes, slowdowns, transportation disruptions or other conditions in the transportation industry, including, but not limited to, shortages of truck drivers, disruptions in rail service, decreases in the availability of vessels or increases in fuel prices, could increase the Company's costs and disrupt Company\u2019s operations and its ability to service customers on a timely basis.\nThe Company's business is seasonal and weather conditions could reduce the Company's net sales.\nThe Company manufactures metal and glass packaging primarily for the beverage and food can market. Its sales can be affected by weather conditions. Due principally to the seasonal nature of the soft drink, brewing, iced tea and other beverage industries, in which demand is stronger during the summer months, sales of the Company's products have varied and are expected to vary by quarter. Shipments in the U.S. and Europe are typically greater in the second and third quarters of the year. Unseasonably cool weather can reduce consumer demand for certain beverages packaged in its containers. In addition, poor weather conditions that reduce crop yields of packaged foods can decrease customer demand for its food containers.\nThe Company has a significant amount of goodwill that, if impaired in the future, would result in lower reported net income and a reduction of its net worth.\nImpairment of the Company's goodwill would require a write down of goodwill, which would reduce the Company's net income in the period of any such write down. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the Company's goodwill was $3.0 billion. The Company is required to evaluate goodwill reflected on its balance sheet at least annually, or when circumstances indicate a potential impairment. If it determines that the goodwill is impaired, the Company would be required to write off a portion or all of the goodwill.\nA significant portion of the Company's workforce is unionized and labor disruptions could increase the Company's costs and prevent the Company from supplying its customers.\nA significant portion of the Company's workforce is unionized and a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with unionized employees could increase its costs and prevent the Company from supplying its customers. In addition, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, the Company may not reach new agreements without union action in certain jurisdictions and any such new agreements may not be on terms satisfactory to the Company. If the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, it may become subject to union-initiated work stoppages, including strikes. Moreover, additional groups of currently non-unionized employees may seek union representation in the future.\nFailure by the Company's joint venture partners to observe their obligations could adversely affect the business and operations of the joint ventures and, in turn, the business and operations of the Company.\nA portion of the Company's operations, including certain beverage can operations in Asia, the Middle East and South America, is conducted through joint ventures. The Company participates in these ventures with third parties. In the event that the Company's joint venture partners do not observe their obligations or are unable to commit additional capital to the joint ventures, it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that the Company would have to increase its level of commitment to the joint venture.\nThe loss of the Company's intellectual property rights may negatively impact its ability to compete.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain the proprietary nature of its technologies, its competitors may use its technologies to compete with it. The Company has a number of patents covering various aspects of its products, including its SuperEnd\u00ae beverage can end, whose primary patent expired in 2016 and Ideal\u2122 product line. The Company's patents may not withstand\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nchallenge in litigation, and patents do not ensure that competitors will not develop competing products or infringe upon the Company's patents. Moreover, the costs of litigation to defend the Company's patents could be substantial and may outweigh the benefits of enforcing its rights under its patents. The Company markets its products internationally and the patent laws of foreign countries may offer less protection than the patent laws of the U.S. Not all of the Company's domestic patents have been registered in other countries. The Company also relies on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology, and others may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to the Company's unpatented technology. In addition, the Company has from time to time received letters from third parties suggesting that it may be infringing on their intellectual property rights, and third parties may bring infringement suits against the Company, which could result in the Company needing to seek licenses from these third parties or refraining altogether from use of the claimed technology.\nRisks Relating to the Company's International Operations\nThe Company's international operations, which generated approximately 63% of its consolidated net sales in 2021, are subject to various risks that may lead to decreases in its financial results.\nThe Company is an international company, and the risks associated with operating in foreign countries may have a negative impact on the Company's liquidity and net income. The Company's international operations generated approximately 63%, 62% and 64% of its consolidated net sales in the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, the Company's business strategy includes continued expansion of international activities, including within developing markets and areas, such as South America, Eastern Europe and Asia, that may pose greater risk of political or economic instability. Further, if a downturn in European economic conditions ultimately leads to a significant devaluation of the euro, the value of the Company's financial assets that are denominated in euro would be significantly reduced when translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Any of these conditions could ultimately harm the Company's overall business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nEmerging markets are a focus of the Company's international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets and the nature of the Company's international operations generally are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022foreign governments' restrictive trade policies;\n\u2022conflicting regulation (including with respect to product labelling, privacy or data protection) or policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022duties, taxes or government royalties, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022customs, import/export control and other trade compliance regulations;\n\u2022foreign exchange rate risks and exchange controls;\n\u2022difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts;\n\u2022non-tariff barriers and higher duty rates;\n\u2022difficulties associated with expatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights and difficulties in protecting intellectual property or sensitive commercial and operations data or information technology systems generally;\n\u2022national and regional labor strikes;\n\u2022geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world;\n\u2022high social benefit costs for labor, including costs associated with restructurings;\n\u2022civil unrest or political, social, legal and economic instability;\n\u2022product boycotts, including with respect to the products of the Company's multi-national customers;\n\u2022customer, supplier, and investor concerns regarding operations in areas such as the Middle East;\n\u2022taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation;\n\u2022imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022hyperinflation and currency devaluation in certain foreign countries where such currency devaluation could affect the amount of cash generated by operations in those countries and thereby affect the Company's ability to satisfy its obligations;\n\u2022war, civil disturbance, global or regional catastrophic events, natural disasters, and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022geographical concentration of the Company's factories and operations and regional shifts in its customer base;\n\u2022periodic health epidemic concerns, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic\n\u2022the complexity of managing global operations; and\n\u2022compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws and sanctions.\nAs the Company seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of the Company's competition, customer base and product offerings.\nThe Company's efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in, geographic markets including but not limited to the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and Asia. In some cases, countries in these regions have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than the Company's other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the Company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements (including conflicting or inconsistent regulations with respect to product labelling, privacy or data protection) that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, repatriation of earnings and regulation of advanced technologies. Such expansion efforts may also use capital and other resources of the Company that could be invested in other areas. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Company's financial results. As emerging geographic markets become more important to the Company, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets, which may lead to industry overcapacity that could adversely affect pricing, volumes and financial results in such markets. Although the Company is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, the Company's reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.\nThe Company is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may reduce its net sales and cash flow.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies as a significant portion of its consolidated net sales, costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's international operations generated approximately 63%, 62% and 64% of its consolidated net sales in the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019. Volatility in exchange rates may increase the costs of its products, impair the purchasing power of its customers in different markets, result in significant competitive benefit to certain of its competitors who incur a material part of their costs in other currencies than it does, and increase its hedging costs and limit its ability to hedge exchange rate exposure. In its consolidated financial statements, the Company translates local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, its reported international revenue and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar will effectively increase the dollar-equivalent of the Company's expenses and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Market Risk\u201d and \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\" in this Annual Report. Although the Company may use financial instruments such as foreign currency forwards from time to time to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations in some cases, it may not elect or have the ability to implement hedges or, if it does implement them, there can be no assurance that such agreements will achieve the desired effect.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2021, a 0.10 movement in the average euro rate would have reduced net income by $7 million.\nThe vote by the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect the Company.\nThe U.K. has ceased to be a member of the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) on January 31, 2020, and the applicable transition period ended on December 31, 2020 (such departure commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The U.K. is also no longer part of the European Economic Area.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nOn December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2021 and provided for, among other things, zero-rate tariffs and zero quotas on the movement of goods between the U.K. and the E.U. Due to the size and importance of the economy of the U.K., the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the U.K.\u2019s future laws and regulations (including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws and employment laws) as well as its legal, political and economic relationships with Europe following its exit of the E.U. may continue to be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and any future agreements (or lack thereof) between the U.K. and the E.U. and, in particular, any potential changes in the arrangements for the U.K. to retain access to E.U. markets. Brexit could result in adverse economic effects across the U.K. and Europe, which could, in turn, affect U.K. sovereign ratings, ratings of relevant transaction parties or the performance of other entities or exposures with a U.K. nexus and also contribute to uncertainty and instability in the global financial markets. In particular, Brexit could impact volatility, liquidity and/or the market value of securities. Accordingly, Brexit could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Indebtedness and Liquidity\nThe substantial indebtedness of the Company could prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its indebtedness.\nThe Company has substantial outstanding indebtedness. As a result of the Company's substantial indebtedness, a significant portion of the Company's cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding indebtedness, and the Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under its senior secured credit facilities, to enable it to repay its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately $6.3 billion of indebtedness, excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs.\nThe Company\u2019s current sources of liquidity includes a securitization facility with a program limit up to a maximum of $500 that expires in July 2023, a securitization facility with a program limit of $200 that expires in December 2023, and a securitization facility with a program limit of $150 that expires in November 2025. Additional sources of the Company's liquidity include borrowings under its $1,650 billion revolving credit facilities that matures in December 2024.\nThe Company's indebtedness includes its \u20ac335 million ($381 million at December 31, 2021) 2.25% senior notes in February 2023; its \u20ac550 million ($626 million at December 31, 2021) 0.75% senior notes in February 2023; its \u20ac600 million ($683 million at December 31, 2021) 2.625% senior notes in September 2024; its \u20ac600 million ($683 million at December 31, 2021) 3.375% senior notes in May 2025; its $875 million 4.75% senior notes in February 2026; its \u20ac500 million ($570 million at December 31, 2021) 2.875% senior notes in February 2026; its $400 million 4.25% senior notes in September 2026; its $350 million 7.375% senior notes in December 2026; its $40 million 7.5% senior notes in December 2096; and its $217 million of other indebtedness in various currencies at various dates through 2026. In addition, the Company\u2019s term loan facilities mature as follows: $81 million in 2022, $81 million in 2023, and $1,184 million in 2024.\nThe substantial indebtedness of the Company could:\n\u2022increase the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rising interest rates;\n\u2022restrict the Company from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities, including any planned expansion in emerging markets;\n\u2022limit the Company's ability to make capital expenditures both domestically and internationally in order to grow the Company's business or maintain manufacturing plants in good working order and repair;\n\u2022limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under the Company's indebtedness, the Company's ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends;\n\u2022require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022require the Company to sell assets used in its business;\n\u2022limit the Company's ability to refinance its existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse credit market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and other terms acceptable to the Company or at all;\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022increase the Company's cost of borrowing;\n\u2022limit the Company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and\n\u2022place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.\nIf its financial condition, operating results and liquidity deteriorate, the Company's creditors may restrict its ability to obtain future financing and its suppliers could require prepayment or cash on delivery rather than extend credit, which could further diminish the Company's ability to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to service its debt obligations. In addition, the Company's ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund its operations will depend on the Company's ability to generate cash in the future.\nSome of the Company's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which would result in the Company's interest expense increasing if interest rates rise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $1.4 billion of the Company's $6.3 billion of total indebtedness and other outstanding obligations were subject to floating interest rates. Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing the Company's interest expense and reducing funds available for operations or other purposes. The Company's annual interest expense was $253 million, $290 million and $367 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2021, a 0.25% increase in variable interest rates would increase its annual interest expense by approximately $4 million before tax. Accordingly, the Company may experience economic losses and a negative impact on earnings as a result of interest rate fluctuation. The actual effect of a 0.25% increase in these floating interest rates could be more than $4 million as the Company\u2019s average borrowings on its variable rate debt may be higher during the year than the amount at December 31, 2021. In addition, the cost of the Company\u2019s securitization and factoring facilities would also increase with an increase in floating interest rates. Although the Company may use interest rate protection agreements from time to time to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations in some cases, it may not elect or have the ability to implement hedges or, if it does implement them, there can be no assurance that such agreements will achieve the desired effect. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Market Risk\u201d and \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in this Annual Report.\nRestrictive covenants in the debt agreements governing the Company's current or future indebtedness could restrict the Company's operating flexibility.\nThe indentures and agreements governing the Company's senior secured credit facilities and outstanding notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to take certain actions. These restrictions may limit the Company's ability to operate its businesses and may prohibit or limit its ability to enhance its operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The Company's senior secured credit facilities require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. The agreements or indentures governing the Company's senior secured credit facilities and certain of its outstanding notes restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company and the ability of all or substantially all of its subsidiaries to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase capital stock, repurchase subordinated debt and make certain investments or loans;\n\u2022create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to the Company from subsidiaries;\n\u2022make loans, investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022change accounting treatment and reporting practices;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to, make or repay loans to, transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell or acquire assets, enter into leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with or into other companies; and\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the indentures and agreements governing the Company's senior secured credit facilities and certain of its outstanding notes limit, among other things, the ability of the Company to enter into certain transactions, such as mergers, consolidations, joint ventures, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and the pledging of assets.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nThe breach of any of these covenants by the Company or the failure by the Company to meet any of these ratios or conditions could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness. If a default occurs under any such indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become immediately due and payable, which could result in a default under the Company's other outstanding debt and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to the Company's senior secured credit facilities, outstanding notes and other outstanding debt. The ability of the Company to comply with these covenants or indentures governing other indebtedness it may incur in the future and its outstanding notes can be affected by events beyond its control and, therefore, it may be unable to meet these ratios and conditions.\nNotwithstanding the Company's current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, the Company may still be able to incur substantial additional debt or make certain restricted payments, which could exacerbate the risks described above.\nThe Company may be able to incur additional debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions or joint ventures. Although the Company's senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing certain of its outstanding notes contain restrictions on the Company's ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The Company may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions or increased capital expenditures, which may increase the Company's indebtedness. Moreover, although the Company's senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing certain of its outstanding notes contain restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends and the repurchase of the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company is able to make such restricted payments under certain circumstances which may increase indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levels or making otherwise restricted payments could intensify the related risks that the Company and its subsidiaries now face.\nThe Company's senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of default. In the event of a change of control, the Company may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations under the senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness.\nThe Company may not have sufficient assets or be able to obtain sufficient third-party financing on favorable terms to satisfy all of its obligations under the Company's senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness in the event of a change of control. The Company's senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities. Such an event of default entitles the lenders thereunder to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the senior secured credit facilities to become due and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities. Any event of default or acceleration of the senior secured credit facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms of other indebtedness of the Company. In addition, the indentures governing certain of the Company's outstanding notes require that the Company offer to repurchase the notes at an offer price of 101% of principal upon certain change of control repurchase events.\nThe Company is subject to certain restrictions that may limit its ability to make payments on its debt out of the cash reserves shown on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe ability of the Company's subsidiaries and joint ventures to pay dividends, make distributions, provide loans or make other payments to the Company may be restricted by applicable state and foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences and their agreements, including agreements governing their debt. In addition, the equity interests of the Company's joint venture partners or other shareholders in the Company's non-wholly owned subsidiaries in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need to be satisfied on a proportionate basis with the Company. As a result, the Company may not be able to access a portion of its cash flow to service the Company's debt.\nThe Company has significant pension plan obligations worldwide and significant unfunded postretirement obligations, which could reduce its cash flow and negatively impact its results of operations and its financial condition.\nThe Company sponsors various pension plans worldwide, with the largest funded plans in the U.S. and Canada. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company contributed $236 million, $27 million and $23 million to its pension plans. The 2021 contribution included a $216 million contribution to its U.K. pension plan in advance of full settlement of the plan's obligations. Pension expense was $1,567 million, including settlement charges of $1,511 million and is expected to be $31 million in 2022, using foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2021. A 0.25% change in the 2022 expected rate of return assumptions would change 2022 pension expense by approximately $4 million. A 0.25% change in the discount rates assumptions as of December 31, 2021 would change 2022 pension expense by approximately $2 million. The Company may be required to accelerate the timing of its contributions under its pension plans. The actual impact of any accelerated funding will depend upon the interest rates required for determining the plan liabilities and the investment performance of plan assets. An\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nacceleration in the timing of pension plan contributions could decrease the Company's cash available to pay its outstanding obligations and its net income and increase the Company's outstanding indebtedness.\nBased on current assumptions, the Company expects to make pension contributions of $27 million in 2022, $28 million in 2023, $15 million in 2024, $16 million in 2025 and $29 million in 2026. Future changes in the factors used to determine pension contributions, including investment performance of plan assets, could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s future contributions and its cash flow available for debt reduction, capital expenditures or other purposes.\nThe difference between pension plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of the Company's pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Among other factors, significant volatility in the equity markets and in the value of illiquid alternative investments, changes in discount rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can substantially increase the Company's future pension plan funding requirements and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations and profitability. See Note R to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. As long as the Company continues to maintain its various pension plans, the Company will continue to incur additional pension obligations. The Company's pension plan assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income securities and also include alternative investments such as interests in private equity and hedge funds. If the performance of plan assets does not meet the Company's assumptions or discount rates decline, the underfunding of the pension plans may increase and the Company may have to contribute additional funds to the pension plans, and the Company's pension expense may increase. In addition, certain of the Company's pension and postretirement plans are unfunded.\nThe Company's U.S. funded pension plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, has the authority to terminate an underfunded plan under certain circumstances. In the event its U.S. pension plan is terminated for any reason while the plan is underfunded, the Company will incur a liability to the PBGC that may be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding, which under certain circumstances may be senior to the Company's outstanding notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2021 the unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, for retiree medical benefits was approximately $137 million, based on assumptions set forth under Note R to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nRisks Relating to Litigation and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is subject to litigation risks which could negatively impact its operations and net income.\nThe Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to matters such as governmental, environmental and employee benefits laws and regulations, securities, labor, and actions arising out of the normal course of business, in addition to asbestos-related litigation described under the risk factor titled \u201cPending and future asbestos litigation and payments to settle asbestos-related claims could reduce the Company's cash flow and negatively impact its financial condition.\u201d The Company is currently unable to determine the total expense or possible loss, if any, that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of such legal proceedings. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings, they could result in significant diversion of time by the Company's management. The results of the Company's pending legal proceedings, including any potential settlements, are uncertain and the outcome of these disputes may decrease its cash available for operations and investment, restrict its operations or otherwise negatively impact its business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nIn March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (\u201cFCO\u201d), conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including one of the Company\u2019s German subsidiaries. The local court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the market for the supply of metal packaging products. The Company conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company. The Company cooperated with the FCO and submitted a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the matter to the European Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including Company subsidiaries in Germany, France and the U.K.\nThe Commission\u2019s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged the Company or any of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. The Company is cooperating with the Commission and submitted a leniency application with the Commission with respect to the findings of the investigation in Germany referenced above. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the investigation the Company believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Commission\u2019s investigation and is unable to estimate the\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nloss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and has therefore not recorded a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that the Company or any of its subsidiaries violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission could be material to the Company\u2019s operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable.\nOn October 7, 2021, the French Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence (the French Competition Authority or \u201cFCA\u201d) issued a statement of objections to 14 trade associations, one public entity and 101 legal entities from 28 corporate groups, including the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, other leading metal can manufacturers, certain can fillers and certain retailers in France. The FCA alleged violations of Articles 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code. The statement of objections alleges, among other things, anti-competitive behavior in connection with the removal of bisphenol-A from metal packaging in France. The removal of bisphenol-A was mandated by French legislation that went into effect in 2015. If the FCA finds that the Company or its subsidiaries violated competition law, the FCA may levy fines. Proceedings with respect to this matter are ongoing and the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome including the amount of fines, if any, that may be levied by the FCA.\nPending and future asbestos litigation and payments to settle asbestos-related claims could reduce the Company's cash flow and negatively impact its financial condition.\nCrown Cork & Seal Company, Inc. (Crown Cork), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is one of many defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits filed throughout the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. In 1963, Crown Cork acquired a subsidiary that had two operating businesses, one of which is alleged to have manufactured asbestos-containing insulation products. Crown Cork believes that the business ceased manufacturing such products in 1963.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Crown Cork's accrual for pending and future asbestos-related claims and related legal costs was $237 million, including $198 million for unasserted claims. The Company determines its accrual without limitation to a specific time period. Assumptions underlying the accrual include that claims for exposure to asbestos that occurred after the sale of the subsidiary's insulation business in 1964 would not be entitled to settlement payouts and that state statutes described under Note O to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, including Texas and Pennsylvania statutes, are expected to have a highly favorable impact on Crown Cork's ability to settle or defend against asbestos-related claims in those states and other states where Pennsylvania law may apply.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Crown Cork received approximately 2,000 new claims, settled or dismissed approximately 1,000 claims, and had approximately 57,000 claims outstanding at the end of the period. Of the Company's outstanding claims, approximately 17,000 claims relate to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos after 1964 and approximately 40,000 relate to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos before or during 1964, of which approximately 13,000 were filed in Texas, 1,500 were filed in Pennsylvania, 6,000 were filed in other states that have enacted asbestos legislation and 19,500 were filed in other states. The outstanding claims at December 31, 2021 also exclude approximately 19,000 inactive claims, as well as claims in Texas filed after June 11, 2003. Due to the passage of time, the Company considers it unlikely that the plaintiffs in these cases will pursue further action. The exclusion of these inactive claims had no effect on the calculation of the Company's accrual as the claims were filed in states where the Company's liability is limited by statute. The Company devotes significant time and expense to defend against these various claims, complaints and proceedings, and there can be no assurance that the expenses or distractions from operating the Company's businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.\nCrown Cork made cash payments of $19 million, $21 million and $22 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019 to settle asbestos claims and pay related legal and defense costs. These payments and any such future payments will reduce the cash flow available to Crown Cork for its business operations and debt payments.\nAsbestos-related payments including defense costs may be significantly higher than those estimated by Crown Cork because the outcome of this type of litigation (and, therefore, Crown Cork's reserve) is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, such as the number or size of asbestos-related claims or settlements, the number of financially viable responsible parties, the extent to which state statutes relating to asbestos liability are upheld and/or applied by the courts, Crown Cork's ability to obtain resolution without payment of asbestos-related claims by persons alleging first exposure to asbestos after 1964, and the potential impact of any pending or future asbestos-related legislation. Accordingly, Crown Cork may be required to make payments for claims substantially in excess of its accrual, which could reduce the Company's cash flow and impair its ability to satisfy its obligations. Further information regarding Crown's Cork's asbestos-related liabilities is presented within \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the headings, \u201cProvision for\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nAsbestos\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d and under Note O to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nThe Company is subject to costs and liabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safety standards.\nLaws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety may increase the Company\u2019s costs of operating and reduce its profitability. The Company's operations are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including those relating to operating permits, treatment, storage and disposal of waste, the use of chemicals in the Company's products and manufacturing process, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination and protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental or employee safety requirements affecting the Company's operations or may impose additional requirements regarding consumer health and safety, such as potential restrictions on the use of bisphenol-A, a starting material used to produce internal and external coatings for some food, beverage, and aerosol containers and metal closures. In the U.S., the FDA has banned the use of bisphenol-A in baby bottles, children\u2019s drinking cups and epoxy resins that coat infant formula cans as well as in packaging and utensils for all foods and the EPA has considered adding bisphenol-A to the chemical concern list on the basis of environmental effects and using its Design for the Environment program to encourage reductions in bisphenol-A manufacturing and use. In addition, the State of California has declared bisphenol-A a reproductive system hazard and listed it as a hazardous chemical under the state Safe Water and Toxic Environment Act. Certain other nations, including Denmark, Belgium, Canada and France, have implemented or considered implementing legislation restricting the use of bisphenol-A, including imposing product labeling requirements or restrictions on the importation and placement in the market of packaging and utensils containing bisphenol-A, and the European Food Safety Authority has recommended that the tolerable daily intake of bisphenol-A be lowered. Domestic and international, federal, state, municipal or other regulatory authorities could further restrict or prohibit the use of bisphenol-A in the future. In addition, public reports, litigation and other allegations regarding the potential health hazards of bisphenol-A could contribute to a perceived safety risk about the Company's products and adversely impact sales or otherwise disrupt the Company's business. While the Company is exploring various alternatives to the use of bisphenol-A and conversion to alternatives is underway in some applications, there can be no assurance the Company will be completely successful in its efforts or that the alternatives will not be more costly to the Company.\nAlso, for example, future restrictions in some jurisdictions on air emissions of volatile organic compounds and the use of certain paint and lacquering ingredients may require the Company to employ additional control equipment or process modifications. The Company\u2019s operations and properties, both in the U.S. and abroad, must comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, a number of governmental authorities in the U.S. and abroad have introduced or are contemplating enacting legal requirements, including emissions limitations, cap and trade systems or mandated changes in energy consumption, in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Given the wide range of potential future climate change regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the potential impact of both climate change and climate change regulation is uncertain.\nClimate change and evolving laws, regulations and market trends in response to climate change could adversely affect the business and operations of the Company.\nThe Company may incur significant costs and experience operational disruptions as a result of increases in the frequency, severity or duration of severe weather events caused by climate change (including thunderstorms, hurricanes, blizzards, wildfires, flooding, typhoons and tornados), and may incur additional costs to prepare for, respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change. Furthermore, in the event that severe weather events or temperature shifts resulting from climate change adversely impact crop yields for fruits and vegetables, our customers\u2019 demand for our products may be reduced due to customers\u2019 inability to make products that require packaging in the first instance. The Company is not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the effects of climate change. The impact of climate change may also vary by geographic location and other circumstances, including weather patterns and any impact to natural resources such as water.\nA number of governmental authorities both in the U.S. and abroad also have enacted, or are considering, legal requirements relating to environmental conservation and sustainability, energy efficiency deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and product stewardship, including mandating recycling, the use of recycled materials and/or limitations on certain kinds of packaging materials such as plastics. In addition, some companies with packaging needs have responded to such developments, and/or to perceived environmental concerns of consumers, by using containers made in whole or in part of recycled materials. Such developments may reduce the demand for some of the Company's products, and/or increase its costs.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nThe Company may experience significant negative effects to its business as a result of new federal, state or local taxes, increases to current taxes or other governmental regulations specifically targeted to decrease the consumption of certain types of beverages.\nPublic health and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the health consequences associated with over-consumption of certain types of beverages, such as sugar-sweetened beverages and including those sold by certain of the Company's significant customers. Possible new federal, state or local taxes, increases to current taxes or other governmental regulations specifically targeted to decrease the consumption of these beverages may significantly reduce demand for the beverages of the Company's customers, which could in turn affect demand of the Company's customers for the Company's products. For example, taxes on certain sugar-sweetened beverages and/or energy drinks have been enacted in France, the U.K., Poland, Portugal, Hungary, India, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Some state and local governments are also considering similar taxes, and several U.S. cities, including in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, and Colorado, have enacted taxes on certain sugar-sweetened beverages. The imposition of such taxes may decrease the demand for certain soft drinks and beverages that the Company's customers produce, which may cause the Company's customers to respond by decreasing their purchases from the Company. Consumer tax legislation and future attempts to tax sugar-sweetened or energy drinks by other jurisdictions could reduce the demand for the Company's products and materially adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.\nDemand for the Company's products could be affected by changes in laws and regulations applicable to food and beverages and changes in consumer preferences.\nThe Company manufactures and sells metal and glass packaging primarily for the beverage and food can market. As a result, many of the Company's products come into direct contact with beverages and food. Accordingly, the Company's products must comply with various laws and regulations for beverages and food applicable to its customers. Changes in such laws and regulations, such as the sugary-drink taxes discussed above, could negatively impact customers' demand for the Company's products as they comply with such changes and/or require the Company to make changes to its products. Such changes to the Company's products could include modifications to the coatings and compounds that the Company uses, possibly resulting in the incurrence of additional costs. Additionally, because many of the Company's products are used to package consumer goods, the Company is subject to a variety of risks that could influence consumer behavior and negatively impact demand for the Company's products, including changes in consumer preferences driven by various health-related concerns and perceptions.\nChanges in accounting standards, taxation requirements and other law could negatively affect the Company's financial results.\nNew accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to the Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on the Company's reported results for the affected periods. The Company is also subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in income tax rates or other changes to tax laws could reduce the Company's after-tax income from affected jurisdictions or otherwise affect the Company's tax liability.\nIn addition, the Company's products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which it operates. Increases in indirect taxes could affect the Company's products' affordability and therefore reduce demand for its products.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business operations and financial position have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and a national emergency by the President of the United States on March 13, 2020, has caused and is continuing to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns and turmoil in the financial markets both in the U.S. and abroad. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of its business and geographies, including how it has impacted and will impact the Company\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers and distribution channels. The pandemic, as well as the quarantines and other governmental and non-governmental restrictions which have been imposed throughout the world in an effort to contain, mitigate, or vaccinate against it and the controversies prompted by such restrictions in some regions, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption which is expected to adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations and may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position or the Company\u2019s ability to execute its short- and long-term business strategies and initiatives. For example, governmental authorities in several\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nregions (including Pennsylvania, where the Company\u2019s world headquarters are located) have ordered the cessation of all business activity which is deemed non-essential and there is a risk that these shutdown orders will be extended or expanded or that similar shutdown orders will be implemented in other regions (particularly in response to newer variant strains of COVID-19, such as Delta or Omicron); while many beverage and food products are deemed essential, several jurisdictions have implemented restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of alcoholic beverages which have reduced the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products. Likewise, Transit Packaging supplies a wide array of industrial markets which are being negatively affected by a decline in global economic activity.\nThe magnitude of COVID-19\u2019s ultimate impact on the Company will depend on numerous evolving factors, future developments and cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that the Company is not able to predict, including: the severity of the outbreak and the international actions that are being taken to contain and treat it; the duration of the outbreak and the myriad of business restrictions being imposed as a result of it; governmental, business and other responses to the outbreak (including limitations on the Company\u2019s operations and/or mandates that the Company provide products or services); the extent and duration of the effect of the outbreak on consumer confidence and spending, customer demand and buying patterns; the promotion of \u201csocial distancing\u201d and the adoption of shelter-in-place orders, vaccine mandates and restrictions on exports affecting customers\u2019 demand for the Company\u2019s products; the extent to which forced remote working arrangements reduce the Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage its global operations; the impact of the outbreak on the Company\u2019s supply chain (including reductions in supply that may result in an inability to meet customer demand); the impact of the outbreak on internal controls (including those over financial reporting); the speed and success of vaccination efforts; any impairment in value of the Company\u2019s tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the effect of the ongoing disruption in the capital markets on the Company\u2019s ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet its liquidity needs. Moreover, employee absenteeism due to members of the Company\u2019s workforce being quarantined or exposed to COVID-19 may impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet staffing needs which, compounded with the effects of ongoing office and potential factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, and other travel or health-related restrictions, may in turn impair the Company in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products.\nIn addition, while the Company cannot predict the magnitude of the impact that COVID-19 will have on its customers and suppliers or their financial conditions, any material effect on the Company\u2019s customers or suppliers could adversely impact the Company. For example, certain of the Company\u2019s suppliers have informed the Company that the coronavirus outbreak and the resulting business restrictions may constrain supply of necessary materials and the Company may face difficulty collecting accounts receivable from any of its customers that may be negatively impacted by the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risk factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report, any of which could have a material effect on the Company. For example, significant volatility in the equity markets could have a negative impact on the market value of the Company's pension plan assets which may substantially increase the Company's future pension plan funding requirements and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations, pension plan funded status and future cash flows.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its overall impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe loss of a major customer and/or customer consolidation could reduce the Company's net sales and profitability.\nMany of the Company's largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of the Company's business with its largest customers. In many cases, such consolidation has been accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of product purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. Increased pricing pressures from the Company's customers may reduce the Company's net sales and net income.\nThe majority of the Company's sales are to companies that have leading market positions in the sale of beverages, packaged food and household products to consumers. The loss of any major customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers or an adverse change in the terms of supply agreements with these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and net income. A continued consolidation of the Company's customers could exacerbate any such loss. In addition, the Company's relationship with several of its customers, particularly in Transit Packaging, is noncontractual, and as a result its customers may unilaterally reduce their purchases of its products.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nThe Company may not be able to manage its anticipated growth, and it may experience constraints or inefficiencies caused by unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand.\nUnanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand for the Company's products may result in constraints or inefficiencies related to the Company's manufacturing, sales force, implementation resources and administrative infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets where the Company is seeking to expand production. Such constraints or inefficiencies may adversely affect the Company as a result of delays, lost potential product sales or loss of current or potential customers due to their dissatisfaction. Similarly, over-expansion, including as a result of overcapacity due to expansion by the Company's competitors, or investments in anticipation of growth that does not materialize, or develops more slowly than the Company expects, could harm the Company's financial results and result in overcapacity.\nTo manage the Company's anticipated future growth effectively, the Company must continue to enhance its manufacturing capabilities and operations, information technology infrastructure, and financial and accounting systems and controls. Organizational growth and scale-up of operations could strain its existing managerial, operational, financial and other resources. The Company's growth requires significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as\nthe development of new products or enhancements of existing products or reduction of the Company's outstanding indebtedness. If the Company's management is unable to effectively manage the Company's growth, its expenses may increase more than expected, its revenue could grow more slowly than expected and it may not be able to achieve its research and development and production goals, any of which could have a material effect on its business, operating results or financial condition.\nAcquisitions, dispositions or investments that the Company is considering, has pursued or may pursue could be unsuccessful, consume significant resources and require the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nThe Company has completed and may consider acquisitions and investments that complement its existing business or dispositions of portions of its existing business. The actual or potential acquisitions, dispositions and investments, such as the Company's recently completed divestiture of its European Tinplate business, involve or may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence (including the incurrence of additional indebtedness under the Company's senior secured revolving credit facilities or other secured or unsecured debt), operating losses and expenses and the diversion of management's attention that could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.\nIn particular, if the Company incurs additional debt, the Company's liquidity and financial stability could be impaired as a result of using a significant portion of available cash or borrowing capacity to finance an acquisition. Moreover, the Company may face an increase in interest expense or financial leverage if additional debt is incurred to finance an acquisition, which may, among other things, adversely affect the Company's various financial ratios and the Company's compliance with the conditions of its existing indebtedness. In addition, such additional indebtedness may be incurred under the Company's senior secured credit facilities or otherwise secured by liens on the Company's assets.\nAcquisitions and dispositions involve numerous other risks, including:\n\u2022diversion of management time and attention;\n\u2022failures to identify material problems and liabilities of acquisition targets or to obtain sufficient indemnification rights to fully offset possible liabilities related to the acquired businesses;\n\u2022difficulties integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022inefficiencies and complexities that may arise due to unfamiliarity with new assets, businesses or markets;\n\u2022disruptions to the Company's ongoing business;\n\u2022inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings;\n\u2022the inability to obtain required financing for the new acquisition or investment opportunities and the Company's existing business;\n\u2022the need or obligation to divest portions of an acquired business;\n\u2022challenges associated with successfully bifurcating operations that involve both remaining and departing personnel in divestiture transactions;\n\u2022challenges associated with operating in new geographic regions or discontinued operations in legacy regions;\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022potential loss of key employees, contractual relationships, suppliers or customers of the acquired businesses or of the Company; and\n\u2022inability to obtain required anti-trust and other regulatory approvals.\nTo the extent the Company pursues an acquisition or disposition that causes it to incur unexpected costs or that fails to generate expected returns, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, and the Company's ability to service its indebtedness may be negatively impacted.\nIf the Company fails to retain key management and personnel, the Company may be unable to implement its business plan.\nMembers of the Company's senior management have extensive industry experience, and it might be difficult to find new personnel with comparable experience. Because the Company's business is highly specialized, the Company believes that it would also be difficult to replace its key technical personnel. The Company believes that its future success depends, in large part, on its experienced senior management team. Losing the services of key members of its management team could limit the Company's ability to implement its business plan. In addition, under the Company's unfunded Senior Executive Retirement Plan certain members of senior management are entitled to lump sum payments upon retirement or other termination of employment and a lump sum death benefit of five times the annual retirement benefit.\nThe Company relies on its information technology and the failure or disruption of its information technology could disrupt its operations and adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company's business increasingly relies on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. A significant portion of the communication between the Company's personnel around the world, customers, and suppliers depends on information technology. As with all large systems, the Company's information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\nThe concentration of processes in shared services centers means that any disruption could impact a large portion of the Company's business within the operating zones served by the affected service center. If the Company does not allocate, and effectively manage, the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect the proper technology infrastructure, the Company could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, as well as potential civil liability and fines under various states' laws in which the Company does business. While the Company has security measures in place designed to protect the integrity of customer information and prevent data loss, misappropriation, and other security breaches, the Company's information technology systems could nevertheless be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes, particularly if the Company's information security training and compliance programs prove to be inadequate. In addition, if the Company's information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and the Company's business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Company may lose revenue and profits as a result of its inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments from its customers, and could experience delays in reporting its financial results, including with respect to the Company's operations in emerging markets. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to prevent security breaches, it may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company or to its customers or suppliers, and it may suffer indirect economic loss if its existing insurance policies and coverage related to information security risks prove to be insufficient. Failure or disruption of the Company's information technology systems, or the back-up systems, for any reason could disrupt the Company's operations and negatively impact the Company's cash flows or financial condition.\nSentiment towards climate change, sustainability and other ESG matters could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has announced sustainability goals for its next phase of Sustainability as part of its Twentyby30 program. Execution of this program and the achievements of the Company\u2019s sustainability goals is subject to risk and uncertainties, many of which are out of the Company\u2019s control. Failure to achieve these sustainability goals within the currently projected costs and expected timeframes could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, customer and investor relationships, or ability to access capital on favorable terms, particularly given investors\u2019 increased focus on ESG matters in recent years, and in turn could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control, the Company may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm the Company's business. The Company must annually evaluate its internal procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management and auditors to assess the effectiveness of internal controls. If the Company fails to remedy or maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation.", "PERMNO": 17726, "SIC": 3411, "TIC": "CCK"}
