{"cik": "793547", "company": "NAVIGATORS GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. The Company believes these risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect the business operations. Further, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the results and business operations.\nThe continuing volatility in the financial markets and the risk of another recession could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial market experienced significant volatility worldwide commencing in the third quarter of 2008. Although the U.S., European and other foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets, it is unclear whether those actions will continue to be effective. Therefore, the financial market volatility and the resulting negative economic impact could continue.\nAlthough the Company continues to monitor market conditions, it cannot predict future market conditions or their impact on the stock price or investment portfolio. Depending on market conditions, the Company could incur future realized and unrealized losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. These economic conditions have had an adverse impact on the availability and cost of credit resources generally, which could negatively affect the ability to obtain letters of credit utilized by the Lloyd\u2019s Operations to support business written through Lloyd\u2019s.\nIn addition, financial market volatility or an economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the insureds, agents, claimants, reinsurers, vendors and competitors. Certain of the actions of the U.S., European and other foreign governments have taken or may take in response to the financial market volatility have impacted, or may impact, certain Property and Casualty insurance carriers. The U.S., European and other foreign governments continue to take active steps to implement measures to stabilize the financial markets and stimulate the economy, and it is possible that these measures could further affect the Property and Casualty insurance industry and its competitive landscape.\nThe business is concentrated in Marine, Property, Casualty and Professional Liability insurance, and if market conditions change adversely, or the Company experiences large losses in these lines, it could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nAs a result of the strategy to focus on specialty products in niches where the Company has underwriting and claims handling expertise and to decrease the business in areas where pricing does not afford what it considers to be acceptable returns, the business is concentrated in the Marine, Property, Casualty and Professional Liability lines of business. If the results of operations from any of these lines are less favorable for any reason, including lower demand for the products on terms and conditions that the Company finds appropriate, flat or decreased rates for the products or increased competition, the impact of a reduction could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nThe Company is exposed to cyclicality in the business that may cause material fluctuations in the results.\nThe property and casualty insurance business generally, and the Marine insurance business specifically, have historically been characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of underwriting capacity have permitted attractive premium levels. The Company has reduced business during periods of severe competition and price declines and grown when pricing allowed an acceptable return. The cyclical trends in the Property and Casualty insurance and reinsurance industries and the profitability of these industries can also be significantly affected by volatile and unpredictable developments, including what the Company believes to be a trend of natural and man-made disasters, fluctuations in interest rates, changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of investments and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by insureds. The Company cannot predict with accuracy whether market conditions will remain constant, improve or deteriorate. The Company expects that the business will continue to experience the effects of this cyclicality, which, over the course of time, could result in material fluctuations in premium volume, revenues or expenses.\nThe Company may not be successful in its diversification efforts, which could adversely affect its results.\nOver the past decade, the Company has diversified the business from being an Ocean Marine specialist to underwriting in a targeted number of specialties, including numerous third-party liability products in the Casualty and Professional Liability niches. The ability to produce profitable underwriting results and grow those businesses is highly dependent upon the quality of the underwriting and claims professionals and the extent of their expertise and quality of their individual risk-taking decisions. In addition, the results can be impacted by change in the competitive, regulatory and economic environment impacting those specific products.\nThe Company may incur additional losses if its loss reserves are insufficient.\nThe Company maintains loss reserves to cover the estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projection techniques and judgment at a given accounting date. These reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Both internal and external events, including changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, may affect the reserve estimation process. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the Company. The Company continually refines reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which the estimates are changed. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established reserves may not be sufficient. If estimated reserves are insufficient, the Company will incur additional charges to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nThe loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business. Short tail business means that claims are generally reported quickly upon occurrence of an event, making estimation of loss reserves less complex. For the long tail lines, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the claim. The longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim, the more likely the ultimate settlement amount will vary. The longer tail business includes General Liability, including construction defect claims, as well as historical claims for asbestos exposures through the Marine business and claims relating to the run-off businesses. The Professional Liability business, though long tail with respect to settlement period, is produced on a claims-made basis (which means that the policy in-force at the time the claim is filed, rather than the policy in-force at the time the loss occurred, provides coverage) and is therefore, the Company believes, less likely to result in a significant time lag between the occurrence of the loss and the reporting of the loss. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will not suffer substantial adverse prior period development in the business in the future.\nIn addition, reinsurance reserves are subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves primarily because a reinsurer relies on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. As a result, in relation to the reinsurance business, the Company is subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks reinsured by the Company and the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate the Company for the risks it assumes. In addition, reinsurance reserves may be less reliable than insurance reserves because there is generally a longer lapse of time from the occurrence of the event to the reporting of the loss or benefit to the reinsurer to the ultimate resolution or settlement of the loss.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legislative, regulatory, judicial, social, financial, and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect the business by either extending coverage beyond the underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency and severity of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after the Company has issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under the insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contact is issued.\nIn addition to loss reserves, preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments.\nIn addition to loss reserves discussed above, the consolidated financial statements contain accounting estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates based on historical experience and other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Any significant change in these estimates could adversely affect its results of operations and/or financial condition. The accounting estimates that are viewed by management as critical are those in connection with reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance recoverables, written and unearned premiums, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and impairment of invested assets.\nThe Company may not have access to adequate reinsurance to protect it against losses.\nThe Company purchases reinsurance by transferring part of the risk it has assumed to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium it receives in connection with the risk. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity, which can affect the business volume and profitability. The reinsurance programs are generally subject to renewal on an annual basis. If the Company were unable to renew the expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either the net exposures would increase, which could increase the costs, or, if the Company was unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, it would have to reduce the level of its underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe exposed risks, which would reduce revenues and possibly net income.\nThe reinsurance operations are largely dependent upon ceding companies\u2019 evaluation of risk.\nThe Company, like other companies that write reinsurance, generally does not evaluate separately each of the assumed individual insurance risks under its reinsurance contracts. As such, the Company is largely dependent upon the ceding companies original underwriting decisions. The Company is subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately or accurately evaluated the risks that they have insured, and it has reinsured, and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate it for the risks it assumes. If the reserves are insufficient to cover the unpaid losses and LAE arising from the reinsurance business, the Company would have to strengthen the reserves and incur charges to its earnings, which could adversely affect future results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nReinsurers may not pay on losses in a timely fashion, or at all, which may increase costs.\nAlthough reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to the Company to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate the obligation to pay claims to the policyholders. Accordingly, the Company bears credit risk with respect to its reinsurers. Specifically, the reinsurers may not pay claims made by the Company on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all of these claims. Either of these events would increase the costs and could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nIntense competition for products could harm the ability of the Company to maintain or increase profitability and premium volume.\nThe Property and Casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. The Company faces competition from both domestic and foreign insurers, many of whom have longer operating histories and greater financial, marketing and management resources. Competition in the types of insurance in which the Company is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions of products and services offered, business experience, marketing and distribution arrangements, agency and broker relationships, levels of customer service (including speed of claims payments), product differentiation and quality, operating efficiencies and underwriting. In addition, insurance industry participants may seek to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions. Continued consolidation within the insurance industry will further enhance the already competitive underwriting environment, as the Company would likely experience more robust competition from larger competitors. Furthermore, insureds tend to favor large, financially strong insurers, and the Company faces the risk that it will lose market share to larger or higher rated insurers. The Company may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. If competition limits the ability to write new business at adequate rates, the ability to transact business would be materially and adversely affected and the results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe Company may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nThe Company depends on the ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriters, claims professionals and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about the Specialty lines of business. If the quality of the executive officers, underwriting or claims team and other personnel decreases, the Company may be unable to maintain the current competitive position in the specialty markets in which the Company operates and be unable to expand the operations into new specialty markets.\nIncreases in interest rates may cause the Company to experience losses.\nBecause of the unpredictable nature of losses that may arise under insurance policies, the Company may require substantial liquidity at any time. The investment portfolio, which consists largely of fixed-income investments, is the principal source of liquidity. The market value of the fixed-income investments is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in prevailing interest rates and various other factors. The Company does not hedge the investment portfolio against interest rate risk. Interest rates are at or close to historic lows. Increases in interest rates during periods when the Company must sell fixed-income securities to satisfy liquidity needs may result in substantial realized investment losses.\nThe investment portfolio is subject to certain risks that could adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAlthough the investment policy guidelines emphasize total investment return in the context of preserving and enhancing shareholder value and statutory surplus of the insurance subsidiaries, the investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular types of securities. Due to these risks, the Company may not be able to realize its investment objectives. In addition, the Company may be forced to liquidate investments at times and prices that are not optimal, which could have an adverse effect on results of operations. Investment losses could significantly decrease the asset base, thereby adversely affecting the ability to conduct business and pay claims.\nThe Company is exposed to significant capital market risks related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign exchange rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe Company is exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. If significant, declines in equity prices, changes in interest rates, changes in credit spreads and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the control of the Company. A rise in interest rates would reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio. It would also provide the opportunity to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would increase the fair value of the investment portfolio. The Company would then presumably earn lower rates of return on assets reinvested. The Company may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover liabilities. Although the Company takes measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, it may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of its assets relative to its liabilities.\nIncluded in the fixed income securities are asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Changes in interest rates can expose the Company to prepayment risks on these investments. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities are prepaid more quickly, requiring the Company to reinvest the proceeds at the then current rates.\nThe fixed income portfolio is invested in high quality, investment-grade securities. However, the Company is generally permitted to hold up to 2% of the total investment portfolio in below investment-grade high yield fixed income securities. These securities, which pay a higher rate of interest, also have a higher degree of credit or default risk. These securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. While the Company has put in place procedures to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of the invested assets, it is possible that, in periods of economic weakness, the Company may experience default losses in the portfolio. This may result in a reduction of net income, capital and cash flows.\nThe Company invests a portion of the portfolio in common stock or preferred stocks. The value of these assets fluctuates with the equity markets. In times of economic weakness, the market value and liquidity of these assets may decline, and may impact net income, capital and cash flows.\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations relative to the functional currency may materially impact the financial position, as the Company conducts business in several non-U.S. currencies. In addition, locally-required capital levels are invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations. One currency in the NavRe Latin American division can be considered hyperinflationary (or subject to a monthly inflation rate greater than 50 percent, as many economists generally define such term). However, the balances in that currency are immaterial.\nDespite mitigation efforts, an increase in interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCapital may not be available to the Company in the future or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nThe capital needs of the business are dependent on several factors, including the ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover the losses. If the current capital becomes insufficient for its future plans, the Company may need to raise additional capital through the issuance of stock or debt. Otherwise, in the case of insufficient capital, the Company may need to limit its growth. The terms of equity or debt offering could be unfavorable, for example, causing dilution to the current shareholders or such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to existing securities. If the Company was in a situation of having inadequate capital and if it was not able to obtain additional capital, the business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected to a material extent.\nA downgrade in the ratings could adversely impact the competitive positions of the operating businesses or negatively affect the ability to implement the business strategy successfully.\nRatings are a critical factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. The Insurance Companies are rated by A.M. Best and S&P. A.M. Best\u2019s and S&P\u2019s ratings reflect their opinions of an insurance company\u2019s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders, and are not evaluations directed to investors. The ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best and S&P. Because these ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies, if these ratings are reduced, the competitive position in the industry, and therefore the business, could be adversely affected in a material manner. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders might move to other companies with higher ratings. In addition, a significant downgrade could subject the Company to higher borrowing costs and the ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. If the Company were to be downgraded below an \u201cA-\u201d, it would be required to provide additional collateral under the letter of credit facility with ING Bank, N.V., London Branch, as Administrative Agent and Letter of Credit Agent. Further, a downgrade below BBB- by S&P would subject the Company to higher interest rates payable on the 5.75% Senior Notes due October 15, 2023 (\u201c5.75% Senior Notes\u201d). Refer to Note 8, Credit Facilities, and Note 9, Senior Notes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding such credit facility and 5.75% Senior Notes, respectively.\nThere can be no assurance that the current ratings will continue for any given period of time. For a further discussion of the ratings, refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Ratings\u201d included herein.\nContinued or increased premium levies by Lloyd\u2019s for the Lloyd\u2019s Central Fund and cash calls for trust fund deposits or a significant downgrade of Lloyd\u2019s A.M. Best rating could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThe Lloyd\u2019s Central Fund protects Lloyd\u2019s policyholders against the failure of a member of Lloyd\u2019s to meet its obligations. The Central Fund is a mechanism which in effect mutualizes unpaid liabilities among all members, whether individual or corporate. The fund is available to back Lloyd\u2019s policies issued after 1992. Lloyd\u2019s requires members to contribute to the Central Fund, normally in the form of an annual contribution, although a special contribution may be levied. The Council of Lloyd\u2019s has discretion to call up to 3% of underwriting capacity in any one year.\nPolicies issued before 1993 have been reinsured by Equitas Insurance Limited (\u201cEquitas\u201d), an independent insurance company authorized by the Financial Services Authority. However, if Equitas were to fail or otherwise be unable to meet all of its obligations, Lloyd\u2019s may take the view that it is appropriate to apply the Central Fund to discharge those liabilities Equitas failed to meet. In that case, the Council of Lloyd\u2019s may resolve to impose a special or additional levy on the existing members, including Lloyd\u2019s corporate members, to satisfy those liabilities.\nAdditionally, Lloyd\u2019s insurance and reinsurance business is subject to local regulation, and regulators in the United States require Lloyd\u2019s to maintain certain minimum deposits in trust funds as protection for policyholders in the United States. These deposits may be used to cover liabilities in the event of a major claim arising in the United States and Lloyd\u2019s may require the Company to satisfy cash calls to meet claims payment obligations and maintain minimum trust fund amounts.\nAny premium levy or cash call would increase the expenses of NCUL, the corporate member, without providing compensating revenues, and could have a material adverse effect on the results.\nThe Company believes that in the event that Lloyd\u2019s rating is downgraded, the downgrade could have a material adverse effect on the ability to underwrite business through the Lloyd\u2019s Operations and therefore on the financial condition or results of operations.\nThe businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce the profitability and limit growth.\nThe insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to insurers and their stockholders and other investors, and relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurance company\u2019s business.\nVirtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in that state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies through the operation of guaranty funds. The effect of these arrangements could reduce profitability in any given period or limit the ability to grow the business.\nIn recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on\nmodifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which became effective on July 21, 2010, established a Federal Insurance Office to, among other responsibilities; identify issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the United States financial system. Any proposed or future legislation or NAIC initiatives may be more restrictive than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs.\nIn response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States Congress has enacted legislation designed to ensure, among other things, the availability of insurance coverage for terrorist acts, including the requirement that insurers provide such coverage in certain circumstances. Refer to \u201cBusiness - Regulation - United States\u201d included herein for a discussion of the TRIA, TRIEA and TRIPRA legislation.\nExtensive changes to the regulatory regime for financial services in the United Kingdom have been enacted. Refer to \u201cBusiness - Regulation - United Kingdom\u201d included herein for a discussion of such proposals.\nThe E.U. Directive on Solvency II may affect how the Company manages the business, subject the Company to higher capital requirements and cause it to incur additional costs to conduct the business in the E.U. (including the United Kingdom) and possibly elsewhere.\nAn E.U. directive covering the capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers, known as Solvency II, was adopted by the European Parliament in April 2009. Solvency II will introduce a new system of regulation for insurers operating in the E.U. (including the United Kingdom) and presents a number of risks to us. Although Solvency II was originally stated to have become effective by October 31, 2012, implementation has been delayed several times. On January 31, 2014, EIOPA set up the timeline for the delivery of the Solvency II Implementing Technical Standards and Guidelines. It was stated that the overall goal was to deliver the regulatory and supervisory framework for the technical implementation of the Solvency II regime from the first day of application, January 1, 2016. Over the last few years, the Company has undertaken a significant amount of work to ensure that it meets the new requirements and this work will continue into 2015. There is also a risk that if the Solvency II requirements are not met on an on-going basis they may impact the capital requirements for the U.K. Branch and Syndicate 1221. These new regulations have the potential to adversely affect the profitability of NIC, NUAL and Syndicate 1221, and to restrict their ability to carry on their businesses as currently conducted. An outstanding issue is the question about how Solvency II will be implemented and whether the new regulations will apply to NIC\u2019s U.K. Branch or to all of its operations, both within and outside of the United Kingdom and the other E.U. countries in which it operates. If the regulations are applied to NIC in its entirety, the Company could be subject to even more onerous requirements under the new regulations. Work is ongoing in this area to find a solution that aligns to the Company\u2019s longer term strategy, but there is no assurance that such a solution can be found.\nThe inability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company in sufficient amounts would harm the ability to meet obligations.\nThe Parent Company is a holding company and relies primarily on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and corporate expenses. The ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Parent Company in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, on earnings and on regulatory restrictions. For a discussion of the insurance subsidiaries\u2019 current dividend-paying ability, please refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources\u201d, included herein. The Parent Company, as an insurance holding company, and the underwriting subsidiaries are subject to regulation by some states. Such regulation generally provides that transactions between companies within the consolidated group must be fair and equitable. Transfers of assets among affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from underwriting subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the consolidated group may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by, state regulatory authorities. The underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to licensing and supervision by government regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which they do business. These regulations may set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, such as the nature of and limitations on investments, the nature of and limitations on dividends to policyholders and stockholders and the nature and extent of required participation in insurance guaranty funds. These regulations may affect the subsidiaries\u2019 ability to provide the Company with dividends.\nCatastrophe losses could materially reduce profitability.\nThe Company is exposed to claims arising out of catastrophes, particularly in the Marine insurance line of business, the NavTech and NavRe businesses. The Company has experienced, and will experience in the future, catastrophe losses, which may materially reduce profitability or harm the financial condition of the Company. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hail, severe winter weather and fires. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as war, explosions or the World Trade Center attack, or caused by unfortunate events such as the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster or the grounding of the cruise ship Costa Concordia. In addition, changing climate conditions could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural catastrophes, which could increase exposure to such losses. The incidence and severity\nof catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Although the Company will attempt to manage exposure to such events, the frequency and severity of catastrophic events could exceed estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.\nThe market price of Navigators common stock may be volatile.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market for equity securities. The price of Navigators common stock may not remain at or exceed current levels. In addition to the other risk factors detailed herein, the following factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of Navigators common stock:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in the quarterly results of operations, including the result of catastrophes,\n\u2022\nChanges in market valuations of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry,\n\u2022\nChanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts,\n\u2022\nIssuances of common shares or other securities in the future,\n\u2022\nA downgrade in the credit ratings,\n\u2022\nThe addition or departure of key personnel, and\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by the Company or the competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances.\nStock markets in the United States often experience price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of Navigators common stock.\nThere is a risk that the Company may be directly or indirectly exposed to recent uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt holdings.\nThe Company is protected by various treaty and facultative reinsurance agreements. The exposure to credit risk from any one reinsurer is managed through diversification by reinsuring with a number of different reinsurers, principally in the United States and European reinsurance markets. Consequently, the Company may be indirectly exposed to recent uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt holdings through certain of its reinsurers. A table of the 20 largest reinsurers by the amount of reinsurance recoverable for ceded losses and LAE and ceded unearned premium is presented in \u201cBusiness\u201d along with their rating from two rating agencies. The 20 largest reinsurers from the United States and Europe represent 75.7% of the Reinsurance Recoverables at December 31, 2014.\nIn addition, the Company invests in non-sovereign fixed maturities where the issuer is located in the Euro Area, an economic and monetary union of certain member states within the European Union that have adopted the Euro as their common currency. As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of such securities was $97.6 million, with an amortized cost of $97.6 million representing 3.8% of the total fixed income and equity portfolio. The largest exposure is in France with a total of $40.1 million followed by The Netherlands with a total of $39.6 million. The Company has no direct material exposure to Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Ukraine or Russia as of December 31, 2014.\nNonetheless, the failure of the European Union member states to successfully resolve a fiscal or political crisis could result in the devaluation of the Euro, the abandonment of the Euro by one or more members of the European Union or the dissolution of the European Union and it is impossible to predict all of the consequences that this could have on the global economy in general or more specifically on the business. Any or all of these events could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, liquidity and financial condition of the Company.\nThe determination of the impairments taken on the investments is subjective and could materially impact the financial position or results of operations.\nThe determination of the impairments taken on the investments varies by investment type and is based upon the periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. The Company cannot be certain that it has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in its financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, which could materially impact its financial position or results of operations. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments.\nIf the Company experiences difficulties with information technology and telecommunications systems and/or data security, the ability to conduct the business might be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies heavily on the successful, uninterrupted functioning of the information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and telecommunications systems. The business and continued expansion is highly dependent upon the ability to perform, in an efficient\nand uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as pricing, quoting and processing policies, paying claims, performing actuarial and other modeling functions. A failure of the IT and telecommunication systems or the termination of third-party software licenses the Company relies on in order to maintain such systems could materially impact the ability to write and process business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary actuarial, legal, financial and other business functions. Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards, as well as internal exposures such as potentially dishonest employees, could expose the IT and data systems to security breaches that may result in liability to the Company, cause the data to be corrupted and cause the Company to commit resources, management time and money to prevent or correct security breaches. If the Company does not maintain adequate IT and telecommunications systems, it could experience adverse consequences, including inadequate information on which to base critical decisions, the loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, litigation exposures, damage to business reputation and increased administrative expenses. As a result, the Company could experience financial losses and ability of the Company to conduct business might be adversely affected.\nCompliance by the Marine business with the legal and regulatory requirements to which they are subject is evolving and unpredictable. In addition, compliance with new sanctions and embargo laws could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nThe Marine business, like the other business lines, is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including economic sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies, both in the jurisdictions in which they are organized and where they sell their insurance and reinsurance products, and that implicate the conduct of insureds. The insurance industry, in particular as relates to international insurance and reinsurance companies, has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the United States, various states within the United States, the E.U., and various countries within the E.U., and the United Kingdom. For example, in 2012, President Obama signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (the \u201cAct\u201d) which created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions against Iran. Among other things, the Act intensifies existing sanctions regarding the provision of goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Iran\u2019s petroleum or petrochemical sector, and included provisions relating to persons that engage in certain insurance or re-insurance activities.\nIncreased regulatory focus on the Company, such as in connection with the matters discussed above, may result in costly compliance burdens and/or may otherwise increase costs, which could materially and adversely impact financial performance. The introduction of new or expanded economic sanctions applicable to Marine insurance could also force the Company to exit certain geographic areas or product lines, which could have an adverse impact on profitability.\nAlthough the Company intends to maintain compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, and have established protocols, policies and procedures reasonably tailored to ensure compliance with all applicable embargo laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions that could severely impact the ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct the business, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company. In addition, certain institutional investors may have investment policies or restrictions that prevent them from holding securities of companies that have contracts with countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. The determination by these investors not to invest in, or to divest from, investing in the common stock of the Company may adversely affect the price at which the common stock trades.\nMoreover, the subsidiaries, such as the Lloyd\u2019s Operations, may be subject to different sanctions and embargo laws and regulations. The reputation and the market for the securities of the Company may be adversely affected if the Lloyd\u2019s Operations engages in certain activities, even though such activities are lawful under applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations.", "PERMNO": 10395, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "NAVG"}
