Risk Factors.\nExcept for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this Annual Report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include projections about our accounting and finances, plans and objectives for the future, future operating and economic performance and other statements regarding future performance. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results include those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part II, Item 7 entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere throughout this Annual Report and in any other documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe are a clinical-stage company with no approved products and no historical product revenues, which makes it difficult to assess our future prospects and financial results.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty. Our operations to date have been limited to developing our technology, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidate ozanimod, and in-licensing, preparing for and undertaking the clinical development of our product candidate RPC4046. As an early stage company, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. Consequently, the ability to predict our future operating results or business prospects is more limited than if we had a longer operating history or approved products on the market.\nOur actual financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include:\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials through all phases of clinical development;\n\u2022\nthe timing of commencement of and enrollment in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\npotential side effects of our product candidates that could delay or prevent approval or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain, as well as the timeliness of obtaining, additional funding to develop our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure and maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements for the future development and/or commercialization of our product candidates, as well as the terms of such arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials or marketing applications for product candidates that may compete with our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products, as well as new products that may receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe availability of generic versions of products that compete with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe timing of regulatory review and approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval, if any;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure directly or through collaborations with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe ability of patients or healthcare providers to obtain coverage or sufficient reimbursement for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability, and the ability of third parties on which we rely upon for clinical development of our product candidates such as contract research organizations (CROs), to adhere to clinical study and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates for the conduct of clinical trials and, if approved, for successful commercialization;\n\u2022\nthe cost, availability and timeliness of supply of sufficient quantities of placebo or comparator drugs used in certain of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe costs to us, and our ability as well as the ability of any third-party collaborators, to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property rights covering our product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\ncosts related to potential intellectual property disputes, and the outcome of any such dispute;\n\u2022\nour ability to adequately support future growth;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and develop additional product candidates; and\n\u2022\nour ability to build our finance infrastructure and improve our accounting systems and controls.\nAccordingly, the likelihood of our success must be evaluated in light of many potential challenges and variables associated with an early-stage drug development company, many of which are outside of our control, and past operating or financial results should not be relied on as an indication of future results.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 2008. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $115.0 million, and as of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $210.9 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. We expect to continue incurring significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations, and to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. We also expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates.\nWe do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of products for the foreseeable future, if ever. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if any of our product candidates, if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022\ncompleting development and clinical trial programs for our product candidates ozanimod and RPC4046;\n\u2022\nentering into collaboration and license agreements, particularly with respect to the development and commercialization of ozanimod;\n\u2022\nseeking and obtaining marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercializing any product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained, including with one or more partners or, if launched independently, successfully establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure.\nIf one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale and we retain commercial rights, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any such approved product candidate. Therefore, even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved product, we may never become profitable. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of expenses and when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if ever.\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We are currently conducting two Phase 3 studies of ozanimod in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS), conducting a Phase 2 study of ozanimod in Ulcerative Colitis (UC), preparing for a Phase 3 study of ozanimod in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Phase 2 study of ozanimod in Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD), and conducting a Phase 2 study of RPC4046 in Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). Developing pharmaceutical product candidates, including conducting clinical trials, is expensive. We will require substantial additional future capital in order to complete clinical development and, if we are successful, to commercialize any of our current product candidates. If the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any foreign regulatory agency, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), requires that we perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate with respect to the development of ozanimod and RPC4046, or repeat studies or trials, our expenses would further increase beyond what we currently expect, and any delay resulting from such further or repeat studies or trials could also result in the need for additional financing.\nOur existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient for us to complete advanced clinical development of any of our product candidates or, if applicable, to commercialize any product candidate that is approved. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development activities and potentially engage in commercialization activities. Because successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require to complete research and development and commercialize our product candidates. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe progress, costs, results of and timing of our ongoing and planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, particularly ozanimod;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies to accept our clinical and preclinical studies and other work as the basis for review and approval of product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA, EMA and any similar regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nwhether AbbVie Bahamas Ltd. and AbbVie Inc., which we refer to together as AbbVie, exercises its option, following the availability of results from the planned Phase 2 trial of RPC4046 in EoE, to collaborate with us on the development and commercialization of RPC4046;\n\u2022\nthe number of product candidates and indications that we pursue, whether developed from our research program for glucagon-like peptide-1 small molecule positive allosteric modulators (GLP-1R PAMs), otherwise developed internally or in-licensed;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and other studies and, if approved, for commercial sale;\n\u2022\nthe availability and costs of placebo and/or comparator drugs used in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour need to expand our development activities and, potentially, our research activities;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs associated with establishing sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any approved product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe cost to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our in-license agreements and the timing of such payments;\n\u2022\nour need and ability to hire additional management, development and scientific personnel; and\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.\nSome of these factors are outside of our control. Based upon our current expected level of operating expenditures and our existing cash and cash equivalents, we believe that we will be able to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases beyond our expectations in spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated. We do not expect our existing capital resources to be sufficient to enable us to complete all of the Phase 3 programs of ozanimod in RMS, UC and CD. Accordingly, we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional funds in the future. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain funding from equity offerings or debt financings, including on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u2022\nseek collaborators for one or more of our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u2022\nsignificantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs or cease operations altogether.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or technologies.\nWe may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of additional indebtedness and/or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt and/or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. In addition, issuance of additional equity securities, or the possibility\nof such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations and/or licensing arrangements in order to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms, including relinquishing or licensing to a third party on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or potentially reserve for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history. We do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of products for the foreseeable future, if ever, and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed our analysis to determine what, if any, impact any prior ownership change has had on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As of December 31, 2014, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $189.0 million that could be limited if we have experienced, or if in the future we experience, an ownership change, which could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidate ozanimod. We are also dependent on the success of our product candidate RPC4046. We cannot give any assurance that any product candidate will successfully complete clinical trials or receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before it can be commercialized.\nOur business and future success is substantially dependent on our ability to develop successfully, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize our product candidate ozanimod, which is the subject of Phase 3 programs in RMS and UC, with an additional Phase 3 program CD in the planning stages. Our business and future success also depends on our ability to develop successfully, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize our product candidate RPC4046, which is currently being studied in a Phase 2 study in EoE. Our product candidates will require additional clinical development, management of clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions (if regulatory approval can be obtained at all), securing sources of commercial manufacturing supply, building of, or partnering with, a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before any revenues can be generated from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA, the EMA or any other foreign regulatory authority, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our clinical trials for ozanimod or RPC4046 will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, or that we will be able to obtain approval from the FDA, the EMA or any other foreign regulatory authority for either of these product candidates. We cannot be certain that we will advance any other product candidates into clinical trials. If any of ozanimod, RPC4046 or any future product candidate is not approved and commercialized, we will not be able to generate any product revenues. Moreover, any delay or setback in the development of any product candidate could adversely affect our business and cause our stock price to fall.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials, as well as data from an interim analysis of a current clinical trial, may not be predictive of future trial results. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. We have never completed a Phase 3 study or submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biologics License Application (BLA).\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and previous\nclinical trials, as well as data from any interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials, of our product candidates, as well as studies and trials of other products with similar mechanisms of action to our product candidates, may not be predictive of the results of ongoing or future clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in preclinical and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies for ozanimod in RMS and UC do not ensure that ongoing and future clinical studies, such as our current and proposed Phase 3 programs will demonstrate similar results or observations. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. In addition to the safety and efficacy traits of any product candidate, clinical trial failures may result from a multitude of factors including flaws in trial design, dose selection, placebo effect and patient enrollment criteria. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Based upon negative or inconclusive results, we or our collaborators may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies. In addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nWe may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at each site;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory concurrence on the design and parameters for the trial;\n\u2022\nobtaining approval for the design of our clinical development programs for each country targeted for trial enrollment;\n\u2022\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial, which may be impacted by the number of competing trials that are enrolling patients;\n\u2022\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate or obtaining sufficient quantities of placebo or comparator drug for use in clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate financing and other resources.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. With respect to our clinical development of ozanimod in RMS, the recent availability of oral therapies such as Gilenya\u00ae (fingolimod), Aubagio\u00ae (teriflunomide) and Tecfidera\u00ae (dimethyl fumarate) may cause patients to be less willing to participate in our clinical trial for an oral therapy in regions in which an oral therapy has been approved. Since RMS is a competitive market in certain regions such as the US and the European Union (EU) with a number of product candidates in development, patients may have other choices with respect to potential clinical trial participation and we may have difficulty in reaching our enrollment targets. In addition, the relatively limited number of RMS patients worldwide (estimated at 500,000) may make enrollment more challenging.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. A suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. For example, it is possible that safety issues or adverse side effects could be observed in our trials for ozanimod in RMS and UC or for RPC4046 in EoE, which could result in a delay, suspension or termination of the ongoing trials of ozanimod (in one or both indications) or of RPC4046. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nIf ozanimod, RPC4046 or any other product candidate is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for it and our business would be materially harmed. For example, if the results of our ongoing trials for ozanimod in RMS and/or UC or RPC4046 in EoE do not achieve the primary efficacy endpoints or demonstrate unexpected safety findings, the prospects for approval of ozanimod or RPC4046, as applicable, as well our stock price and our ability to create stockholder value would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in composition of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any clinical trials we or any of our collaborators may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. If we are unable to bring any of our current or future product candidates to market, or to acquire any marketed, previously approved products, our ability to create long-term stockholder value will be limited.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The competition in the RMS market is particularly intense. We have competitors both in the US and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. For example, the branded RMS treatment market today includes the ABCRs (including Avonex\u00ae (interferon (IFN) \u00df-1a), Betaseron\u00ae (IFN \u00df -1b), Copaxone\u00ae (glatiramer acetate) and Rebif\u00ae (IFN \u00df-1a)), Tysabri\u00ae (natalizumab), Lemtrada\u2122 (alemtuzumab), mitoxantrone, Aubagio\u00ae, Gilenya\u00ae and Tecfidera\u00ae. In January 2014, Teva received a refusal to its Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Nerventra\u00ae (laquinimod), submitted for regulatory approval in 2012, and subsequently Teva requested a re-review of the MAA by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) re-examined the initial opinion, and confirmed the refusal of the marketing authorization in May 2014. In addition, there are a number of active clinical trials ongoing in RMS for additional product candidates. For Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which consists of UC and Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD), drug sales from four therapeutic categories substantially comprise the market, including intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs (including mesalamine, budesonide, hydrocortisone and others), immunosuppressive agents (including Remicade\u00ae (infliximab), Simponi\u00ae (golimumab), Tysabri\u00ae, Cimzia\u00ae\n(certolizumab pegol) and Humira\u00ae (adalimumab)) antimetabolites (including methotrexate and others), and lymphocyte trafficking agents (Entyvio\u00ae (vedolizumab)).In addition, there are several late-stage pipeline programs in development for IBD indications. For EoE, there are currently no approved drugs indicated for that disorder, although steroids are prescribed off-label and several anti-inflammatory targeted drugs are in development for EoE.\nOral RMS therapies in particular represent competition for us, since ozanimod is being developed as an oral therapy. The first oral treatment for RMS, Novartis\u2019 Gilenya\u00ae, was approved in September 2010. In 2014, Gilenya\u00ae achieved approximately $2.5 billion in worldwide sales. Like ozanimod, Gilenya\u00ae is an S1PR modulator, although non-selective. Whereas Gilenya\u00ae is already approved and is currently being marketed, ozanimod is in the Phase 3 portion of a Phase 2/3 trial for RMS and will require significant additional clinical development before it will be eligible for approval, if ever. Gilenya\u00ae will thus have at least a several-year period, prior to any market entrance by ozanimod, in which to acquire additional brand identity and market share. Aside from Gilenya\u00ae, other oral therapies for RMS have recently been approved. Specifically, in 2012, Genzyme\u2019s Aubagio\u00ae became the second oral therapy approved for RMS, and in March 2013, Biogen Idec\u2019s Tecfidera\u00ae became the third oral therapy approved for RMS. Although not an S1PR modulator, Tecfidera\u00ae in particular has built upon the shift in treatment paradigm from a largely injectable product landscape to an oral product landscape. In 2014, Tecfidera\u00ae achieved $2.9 billion in worldwide sales. In the development pipeline for oral therapies, Nerventra\u00ae\u2018s sponsors (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Active Biotech AB) have announced their commitment to pursue US registration based on a phase 3 RMS study currently estimated to be completed in June 2018. Beyond Gilenya\u00ae, which is approved, the late-stage S1PR modulator drug pipeline of potential competition in RMS consists of one other active programs, MT-1303 (under development by Mitsubishi Tanabe). Mitsubishi Tanabe has initiated Phase 2 studies of MT-1303 in RMS and psoriasis. S1PR modulator drug pipeline programs, siponimod (under development by Novartis) and ponesimod (under development by Actelion), have diverted development to SPMS or suspended further development pending partnership, respectively. In June 2014, Merck KGaA announced that it had reached a mutual agreement with Ono Pharmaceuticals to terminate the license agreement for a fourth program, ceralifimod (Ono-4641), because it did not meet Merck\u2019s criteria for further investment.\nAlthough we believe ozanimod has the potential to demonstrate differentiation as the best S1PR modulator in RMS, as clinical development of ozanimod is conducted and trial results become known it is possible that the data will not support such differentiation, whether as a result of the effectiveness of ozanimod in RMS or as a result of its safety profile. With respect to efficacy, for example, whereas Gilenya\u00ae is a non-selective S1PR modulator with activity on four of the five S1P receptors and ozanimod is by comparison more selective for the S1P1R and to a lesser extent, the S1P5R, it is possible that efficacy for an S1PR modulator benefits from, and is potentially dependent upon, broader activity among the S1P receptors and that ozanimod\u2019s profile will not result in best-among-S1PR modulator effectiveness, or even meaningful effectiveness. Moreover, although we believe ozanimod has the potential for clinically meaningful improved safety features, late-stage clinical trial results may be inconsistent with earlier studies and not support such a safety profile. Inasmuch as ozanimod will, if approved in RMS, be entering a market in which the first approved oral therapy (Gilenya\u00ae, which is also an S1PR modulator) will have been available since 2010, the absence of differentiation for ozanimod as the best S1PR modulator in RMS may adversely affect the ability of ozanimod to be approved for commercialization. If approved, the absence of differentiation for ozanimod as the best S1PR modulator in RMS would adversely affect the ability of ozanimod to gain market share and otherwise be commercialized successfully. In addition, at such time as ozanimod is approved for marketing in RMS, if ever, the patent protection for Gilenya\u00ae may have lapsed, in which case generic treatments of Gilenya\u00ae may be available. The competition represented by generic alternatives to or versions of an S1PR modulator, including the expected lower cost of any such generic alternatives, would adversely affect the ability of ozanimod, if approved, to gain market share and otherwise be commercialized successfully.\nWe have publically disclosed results of the induction period of a Phase 2 study of ozanimod in UC and plan to initiate in 2015 a Phase 3 program for ozanimod in UC and a Phase 2 program for ozanimod in CD. Although we believe ozanimod has the potential to be the best orally administered therapy, as well as the first S1PR\nmodulator approved, for the treatment of UC, as clinical development of ozanimod in UC is conducted and trial results become known it is possible that the data will not support such differentiation, whether as a result of the effectiveness of ozanimod in UC, the safety profile of ozanimod or the relative pace of development and potential timing for regulatory approval, if any, of ozanimod in UC. To our knowledge, currently there are no other S1P1 modulators in Phase 2 clinical trials for UC. It is possible, particularly as clinical results for the use of an S1PR modulator in UC become available (including, for example, from our Phase 2 trial of ozanimod in UC), that an approved therapy, such as Gilenya\u00ae, could be used for UC patients notwithstanding the absence of regulatory approval (so called \u201coff-label\u201d use). Where applicable, off-label use of generic alternatives to Gilenya\u00ae may also occur. Xeljanz\u00ae (tofacitinib), Pfizer\u2019s oral JAK tyrosine kinase inhibitor which is approved for Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently in phase 2 development for CD and phase 3 development for UC. Although Xeljanz\u00ae is not an S1PR modulator, its advanced stage of development relative to ozanimod in UC may provide Xeljanz\u00ae with the opportunity to become the first approved oral therapy for UC. KRP203, a non-selective S1PR modulator being developed by Kyorin and Novartis, has completed a Phase 2 exploratory trial for UC under Novartis sponsorship and is in Phase 2 development for CD in Japan under Kyorin sponsorship. If ozanimod is not the first-approved S1PR modulator for UC, the ability of ozanimod to be approved for commercialization in UC may be adversely affected. In addition, any off-label use of another S1PR modulator in UC would adversely affect the ability of ozanimod, if approved, to gain market share and otherwise be commercialized successfully in UC.\nRPC4046 is a recombinant, humanized, high-affinity, selective, anti-interleukin-13 (IL-13) monoclonal antibody. IL-13 antagonists have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of allergic and other immunological disorders, with the first human proof-of-concept data being obtained in a Phase 2 study of Genentech\u2019s anti-IL-13 antibody lebrikizumab for the treatment of Asthma. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical study of RPC4046 in an allergic/immune-mediated disorder, EoE, which is an Orphan Disease for which there is currently no FDA-approved therapy. It is possible that other anti-IL-13 antibodies may also pursue approval in EoE. For example, QAX-576, an intravenously administered anti-IL-13 antibody currently in development by Novartis for EoE and other indications, has completed an exploratory single dose Phase 2 study in 25 patients with EoE. The absence of status for RPC4046 as the first-approved therapy in EoE may adversely affect the ability of RPC4046, if approved, to gain market share and otherwise be commercialized successfully in EoE. In particular, the presence of other approved anti-IL-13 therapies may adversely affect the ability of RPC4046 to gain market share and otherwise be commercialized successfully.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products that are more effective or less costly than any drug candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop. If approved, our product candidates will face competition from commercially available drugs as well as drugs that are in the development pipelines of our competitors.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval or discovering, developing and commercializing medicines before we do, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety of our product candidates, including as relative to marketed products and product candidates in development by third parties;\n\u2022\nthe time it takes for our product candidates to complete clinical development and receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain a good relationship with regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe ability to commercialize and market any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe price of our products, including in comparison to branded or generic competitors;\n\u2022\nwhether coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement are available under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;\n\u2022\nthe ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval; and\n\u2022\nacceptance of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval by physicians and other healthcare providers.\nIf our competitors market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our future products, if any, or that reach the market sooner than our future products, if any, we may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical.\nWe may not be successful in establishing development and commercialization collaborations, which could adversely affect, and potentially prohibit, our ability to develop our product candidates.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products are expensive. Accordingly, we may seek to enter into collaborations with companies that have more resources and experience. For example, we may seek a development and commercial partner for ozanimod, particularly since the substantial costs of developing an RMS therapy or UC therapy in later-stage clinical trials may otherwise be prohibitive. If we are unable to obtain a partner for ozanimod, we may be unable to advance the development of ozanimod through late-stage clinical development and seek approval in any market. In addition, although AbbVie has an option to enter into a global collaboration for RPC4046 with us following the availability of Phase 2 results in EoE, if AbbVie declines such option, we may elect to seek a different development and commercial partner for RPC4046, if we believe such Phase 2 results warrant further development. We do not intend to enter into a collaboration agreement for the development of ozanimod unless we retain key decision-making, development and/or commercialization rights, and it may be difficult to find a suitable partner willing to share such rights. In situations where we enter into a development and commercial collaboration arrangement for a product candidate, we may also seek to establish additional collaborations for development and commercialization in territories outside of those addressed by the first collaboration arrangement for such product candidate. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties with respect to otherwise unlicensed or unaddressed territories. There are a limited number of potential partners, and we expect to face competition in seeking appropriate partners. If we are unable to enter into any development and commercial collaborations and/or sales and marketing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to successfully develop and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and/or effectively market and sell approved products, if any.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, and any partner may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our ability to develop certain of our product candidates and our financial condition and operating results.\nEven if we are able to establish collaboration arrangements, any such collaboration may not ultimately be successful, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. If we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party. For example, if AbbVie elects to exercise its option to enter into a global collaboration for RPC4046 with us following the availability of Phase 2 results in EoE, AbbVie will have control of any ex-US commercialization in the event RPC4046 is approved. It is possible that a partner may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidate or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, in which event the development and commercialization of such product candidate could be delayed or terminated and our business could be substantially harmed. In addition, the terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us or may not be perceived as favorable, which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing development of a product candidate or research program under a collaboration and the payment we receive from our partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. Moreover, collaborations and sales and marketing arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement and they may require substantial resources to maintain.\nWe are subject to a number of additional risks associated with our dependence on collaborations with third parties, the occurrence of which could cause our collaboration arrangements to fail. Conflicts may arise between us and partners, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of clinical data, the achievement of milestones, the interpretation of financial provisions or the ownership of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any such conflicts arise, a partner could act in its own self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interests. Any such disagreement between us and a partner could result in one or more of the following, each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates, and in turn prevent us from generating sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability:\n\u2022\nreductions in the payment of royalties or other payments we believe are due pursuant to the applicable collaboration arrangement;\n\u2022\nactions taken by a partner inside or outside our collaboration which could negatively impact our rights or benefits under our collaboration; or\n\u2022\nunwillingness on the part of a partner to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities.\nAbbVie retains rights to the antibody which is the subject of RPC4046 which could conflict with the development and commercialization of RPC4046.\nOur rights to RPC4046, which are the subject of an exclusive development agreement with AbbVie limited in scope to conducting a Phase 2 study of RPC4046 in EoE, do not preclude AbbVie from using the anti-IL-13 antibody in other products which are not solely specific to the IL-13 target. Whether AbbVie elects to exercise its option to enter into a global collaboration for RPC4046 with us following the availability of Phase 2 results in EoE, or in the alternative AbbVie does not elect such a collaboration and we receive an exclusive worldwide license to RPC4046 which will be unlimited as to indications, AbbVie will retain the right to use the anti-IL-13 antibody in other products that are not solely specific to the IL-13 target. While we believe that any such product would necessarily be meaningfully different from RPC4046, there can be no assurance that any such product would not have certain qualities in common with or similar to RPC4046 and thus be potentially competitive with RPC4046, or that adverse events arising from the clinical development of any such product would not have an impact on the development, commercialization or potential value of RPC4046 due, for example, to such qualities. With respect to the patent portfolio for RPC4046, which is in-licensed from AbbVie, AbbVie maintains\nrights to prosecute and maintain patents and patent applications within the portfolio as well as to assert such patents against infringers within and outside the scope of our license, and to defend such patents against claims of invalidity and unenforceability. Although we have rights to consult with AbbVie on actions taken as well as back-up rights of prosecution and enforcement, another AbbVie product covered by the same patent portfolio, such as a different product using the anti-IL-13 antibody, could potentially influence AbbVie\u2019s interests in the exercise of its prosecution, maintenance and enforcement rights in a manner that may favor the interests of such other product as compared with RPC4046. In addition, while the term of the composition of matter patent for RPC4046 in the US could be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act if RPC4046 achieves regulatory approval, such an extension for RPC4046 is subject to AbbVie\u2019s consent where AbbVie does not exercise its option to enter into a global collaboration for RPC4046 with us and we instead receive an exclusive worldwide license to RPC4046. If the extension is otherwise available in such context it is possible that AbbVie would instead utilize or choose to reserve the opportunity for an extension of the composition of matter patent for a different product using the anti-IL-13 antibody, in which case we would not have the benefit of a potential extended patent term for RPC4046.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, supplemental NDA (sNDA), BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the US or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change or differ from one another significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market ozanimod and/or RPC4046, which would harm our business, results of operations and prospects significantly. In addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nWe have not previously submitted an NDA, a BLA, a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) or any similar drug approval filing to the FDA, the EMA or any comparable foreign authority for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, to a significant extent, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights or share in revenues from the exercise of such rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nOzanimod is an S1PR modulator which is selective for the GPCRs termed S1P1R and S1P5R. Upon initial treatment, S1PR modulators have been associated with a dose-dependent transient drop in heart rate that attenuates over time. During its development program, Gilenya\u00ae, a non-selective S1PR modulator, was reported to cause certain cardiovascular side effects, including abnormal slowing of the heart rate, or bradyarrhythmia, and atrioventricular (AV) blocks after first dose administration. The prescribing information for Gilenya\u00ae requires that six hours of cardiac monitoring occur upon first dose administration to observe patients for potential cardiovascular side effects. In a Phase 1 study of ozanimod, the findings we observed are consistent with the biology of S1P1R agonism, including potential dose-dependent effects on target organ systems, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary effects, with subjects treated with higher doses (such as 1.5 mg and higher) experiencing greater changes on parameters. Although pharmaceutic properties of ozanimod including low maximum concentration (or \u201cCmax\u201d), slow time to maximum concentration (or \u201cTmax\u201d) and lower overall exposure may provide the potential for an improved cardiac conduction profile which may reduce risk of cardiovascular side effects, in our ongoing development of ozanimod we are also employing a dose titration strategy to further improve patient outcomes upon first dose administration. Based on the high potency of ozanimod, we are exploring the potential for efficacy at a lower dose in an effort to further improve the cardiovascular safety profile. Despite these features and efforts, as clinical development of ozanimod is conducted and trial results become known, it is possible the data will reveal that ozanimod may have a\ncardiovascular safety profile which is no better than, and possibly inferior to, Gilenya\u00ae. Moreover, whether or not ozanimod has an improved profile, since ozanimod is an S1PR modulator, physicians may nonetheless associate ozanimod with adverse cardiovascular side effects. In connection with any approval of ozanimod, cardiac monitoring may be required upon first dose administration to observe patients for potential cardiovascular side effects. Required cardiac monitoring as well as dose titration will adversely affect the convenience of prescribing ozanimod and the initiation of patients on the therapy, if ozanimod is approved, and may thus adversely affect the adoption and market potential of ozanimod.\nCommon Gilenya\u00ae adverse reactions include headache, influenza, diarrhea, back pain, liver transaminase elevations and cough. In addition to the risks of bradyarrhythmia and AV blocks, prescribing information warnings and precautions for Gilenya\u00ae include risks of infection, macular edema, respiratory effects, hepatic effects (elevations in liver enzymes), fetal risk, blood pressure effects and immune system effects following discontinuation of therapy (long lymphocyte recovery time of one-to-two months). Aside from hepatic effects, we believe these reactions and risks are associated with S1PR modulation. Since ozanimod is also an S1PR modulator, although selective for S1P1R and S1P5R, these adverse reactions and risks could apply to use of ozanimod. However, we believe that by virtue of its pharmaceutic properties, ozanimod has the potential to improve upon the cardiovascular side effect profile and immune system effects following discontinuation of therapy as well as the non-class hepatic effects.\nIf one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf serious adverse events or other undesirable side effects are identified during the development of ozanimod or any other product candidate for one indication, we may need to abandon our development of ozanimod or such other product candidate for any other indications.\nWe are simultaneously developing ozanimod for RMS, UC and CD. When a drug candidate is in development for multiple indications, different patient populations are involved and side effects could be identified in either population. Side effects found during the development of ozanimod or any other product candidate for one indication, particularly if severe or having unexpected characteristics, could require us to abandon our development of ozanimod or any other product candidate at issue for other potential indications. We cannot assure you that severe or unexpected side effects with respect to ozanimod or any other product candidate will not develop in current or future clinical trials, which could delay or preclude regulatory approval of ozanimod or any other product candidate at issue or limit its commercial use.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon CROs to monitor and manage data for our preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs also rely upon clinical sites and investigators for the\nperformance of our clinical trials in accordance with the applicable protocols and applicable legal, regulatory and scientific standards. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and applicable legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs as well as clinical sites and investigators does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We, our CROs, as well as the clinical sites and investigators are required to comply with current good clinical practices (GCPs), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, investigators and clinical sites. If we, any of our CROs or any of the clinical sites or investigators fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. We also cannot assure you that our CROs, as well as the clinical sites and investigators, will perform our clinical trials in accordance with the applicable protocols as well as applicable legal, regulatory and scientific standards, or report the results obtained in a timely and accurate manner. In addition to GCPs, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. While we have agreements governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over the actual performance of our CROs as well as the performance of clinical sites and investigators. In addition, significant portions of the clinical studies for our product candidates will be conducted outside of the US, which will make it more difficult for us to monitor CROs as well as clinical sites and investigators and perform visits of our clinical sites, and will force us to rely heavily on CROs to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials in accordance with the applicable protocols and compliance with applicable regulations, including GCPs. Failure to comply with applicable protocols and regulations in the conduct of the clinical studies for our product candidates may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nSome of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated.\nIf any of our relationships with these CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure (including by clinical sites or investigators) to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed significantly.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely completely on third parties to manufacture our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidate.\nIf, for any reason, we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of our product candidates or placebo or comparator drug used in certain of our clinical trials, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage\nissues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials. We do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We do not control the implementation of the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers for compliance with the regulatory requirements, known as cGMPs, for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to applicable specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials, and if approved, for commercial sale. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have access to a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a contract manufacturer or other third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates. Additionally, if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may experience unforeseen difficulties or challenges in the manufacture of our product candidates on a commercial scale compared to the manufacture for clinical purposes.\nWe are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of RPC4046 in EoE. As part of our Development License and Option Agreement, AbbVie has agreed to manufacture quantities of RPC4046 drug substance and drug product needed for preclinical and clinical studies, including the Phase 2 study of RPC4046 in EoE. Should AbbVie elect at its option to enter into a collaboration with us following the completion of the planned Phase 2 trial of RPC4046 in EoE, AbbVie can elect to manufacture and supply the collaboration with RPC4046 or effect technology transfer to a third-party manufacturer to supply the collaboration. If AbbVie does not exercise its option to collaborate, the parties will either agree on the terms for AbbVie to supply RPC4046 to us or AbbVie will effect technology transfer to a third-party manufacturer. If technology transfer occurs in either scenario, and if we or AbbVie are unable to arrange for such a third-party manufacturing source or fail to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or if AbbVie fails to supply RPC4046 on a timely basis, any ability to develop and commercialize RPC4046 will be adversely affected. Additionally, an inability to effect technology transfer in a timely fashion will impact the pace and potential success of our development efforts as well as our prospects for potential commercialization.\nWe expect to continue to depend on contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers for the foreseeable future. We currently obtain our supplies of finished drug product through individual purchase orders.\nWe have not entered into long-term agreements with our current contract manufacturers or with any alternate fill/finish suppliers. Although we intend to do so prior to any commercial launch in order to ensure that we maintain adequate supplies of finished drug product, we may be unable to enter into such an agreement or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse impact upon our business.\nWe rely on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we seek to develop product candidates with validated mechanisms of action and we utilize biomarkers to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical data and other results obtained by third parties that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. Further, such clinical data and results may, at times, be based on products or product candidates that are significantly different from our product candidates. If the third-party data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable or not applicable to our product candidates, we could make inaccurate assumptions and conclusions about our product candidates and our research and development efforts could be materially adversely affected.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. For example, the prescribing information for Gilenya\u00ae requires that six hours of cardiac monitoring occur upon first dose administration to observe patients for potential cardiovascular side effects. In connection with any approval of ozanimod, cardiac monitoring may be required upon first dose administration. Required cardiac monitoring will adversely affect the convenience of prescribing ozanimod and the initiation of patients on the therapy, if ozanimod is approved, and may thus adversely affect the adoption and market potential of ozanimod.\nIf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements and continued compliance with cGMPs and GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in\nexisting requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization. To the extent any of our product candidates for which we maintain commercial rights is approved for marketing, if we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to effectively market and sell any product candidates, or generate product revenues.\nWe currently do not have a marketing or sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval, we would have to build marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. In the event of successful development of ozanimod and/or RPC4046, we may elect to build a targeted specialty sales force which will be expensive and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. With respect to our product candidates, we may choose to partner with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. In the instance of RPC4046, should AbbVie elect to enter into a collaboration with us following completion of the Phase 2 trial of RPC4046 in EoE, then we will have co-promotion and commercialization rights with AbbVie in the US with AbbVie having control of commercialization outside the US. If we are unable to enter into collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of approved products, if any, on acceptable terms or at all, or if any such partner (including AbbVie if it exercises its option to collaboration with us on RPC4046) does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product or otherwise fails in commercialization efforts, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future revenue will be materially and adversely impacted.\nAlthough we have obtained SPA agreements for our Phase 3 studies of ozanimod in RMS, these agreements do not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review of these trials of ozanimod.\nWe have obtained SPA agreements from the FDA for our Phase 3 studies of ozanimod in RMS. The FDA\u2019s SPA process creates a written agreement between the sponsoring company and the FDA regarding clinical trial design and other clinical trial issues that can be used to support approval of a product candidate. The SPA is intended to provide the sponsoring company with assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed and the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA. However, SPA agreements are not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, SPA agreements are not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, if other new scientific concerns regarding product candidate safety or efficacy arise or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocols. SPA agreements do not address all of the variables and details that may go into planning for or conducting a clinical trial, and any change in the protocol for a clinical trial can invalidate the SPA agreement unless the change is intended to improve the clinical trial at issue and the FDA agrees in writing prior to implementation. A protocol change entails a resubmission to the FDA and triggers a new cycle of FDA review which is not limited to the change. In the event of a resubmission, there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with the proposed changes or that delays in the applicable development program will not occur as a result. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the FDA will ultimately consider either of our SPA agreements to be binding, in which event the FDA could assert that additional data, including data obtained through one or more additional clinical trials, may be required to support a regulatory submission. In addition, while an SPA agreement addresses the requirements for submission of an NDA, the results of the related clinical trial(s) may not support FDA approval.\nOur revenues to date have been generated through our collaboration agreements and we may not receive any additional revenues under such agreements.\nTo date, our sources of revenue have been the upfront and milestone payments received under now-concluded collaborations utilizing our proprietary GPCR platform with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co., as well as a completed collaboration and ongoing technology transfer program with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. We do not expect to receive further payments pursuant to the collaborations with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly. Additional payments under the collaboration with Ono Pharmaceuticals are based on the achievement of various research and development milestones. Future payments from Ono Pharmaceuticals are uncertain because the nature of the research and development activities is inherently uncertain, and Ono Pharmaceuticals may choose not to pursue activities that would support achievement of the milestones. If we do not receive any further milestone payments from Ono Pharmaceuticals and we are unable to enter into new collaborations utilizing our proprietary GPCR platform, then our reliance on other potential sources of funding for our operations will be increased. Financing from such other potential sources may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community, which is critical to commercial success. Market acceptance of any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the product candidate as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, the medical community and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe convenience of prescribing and initiating patients on the product candidate, which may be adversely affected in the instance of ozanimod by dose titration as well as cardiac monitoring upon first dose administration;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of such product candidate over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, and we may not become or remain profitable.\nEven if we obtain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates from the FDA, we may never obtain approval for such product candidates outside of the US, which would limit our market opportunities and adversely affect our business.\nSales of our product candidates outside of the US will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval and, to the extent that we retain commercial rights following\nclinical development, we would plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in the US, the EU and additional foreign countries. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the US, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the US, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval. We may decide to submit an MAA to the EMA for approval. As with the FDA, obtaining approval of an MAA from the EMA is a similarly lengthy and expensive process and the EMA has its own procedures for approval of product candidates. Even if a product is approved, the FDA or the EMA, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the US and the EEA also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected.\nCoverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance. Recent legislative and regulatory activity may exert downward pressure on potential pricing and reimbursement for any of our product candidates, if approved, that could materially affect the opportunity to commercialize.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. To the extent that we retain commercial rights following clinical development, we would seek approval to market our product candidates in the US, the EU and other selected foreign jurisdictions. Market acceptance and sales of our product candidates, if approved, in both domestic and international markets will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels. We cannot be certain that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates, if approved. Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, any of our product candidates, if approved. If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis for any of our product candidates, if approved, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any such product candidate. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-\neffectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement or to have pricing set at a satisfactory level. If reimbursement of our future products, if any, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels such as may result where alternative or generic treatments are available, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of any of our product candidates, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability of our products in such country.\nIn the US, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. Any negotiated prices for any of our product candidates, if approved, covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain outside of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Moreover, while Medicare Part D applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment under Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.\nThe US and several other jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any of our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy-makers and payors in the US and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the US, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for any of our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe ability to set a price that we believe is fair for any of our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, ACA), became law in the US. The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of healthcare and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could\nnegatively affect market acceptance of any of our product candidates, if they are approved. Provisions of ACA relevant to the pharmaceutical industry include the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nan increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts on negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nnew requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel, especially Faheem Hasnain, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Graham Cooper, our Chief Financial Officer, Sheila Gujrathi, our Chief Medical Officer, Marcus Boehm, our Chief Technology Officer, Robert Peach, our Chief Scientific Officer, Chrysa Mineo, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, and Christian Waage, our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, whose services are critical to the successful implementation of our product candidate acquisition, development and regulatory strategies. We are not aware of any present intention of any of these individuals to leave our company. In order to induce valuable employees to continue their employment with us, we have provided stock\noptions that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could harm our business, financial condition and prospects. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, scientific, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nmanaging our clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u2022\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to hire, train and integrate additional management, scientific, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we engage in an acquisition, reorganization or business combination, we will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations or our stockholders.\nFrom time to time we have considered, and we will continue to consider in the future, strategic business initiatives intended to further expand and develop our business. These initiatives may include acquiring businesses, technologies or products or entering into a business combination with another company. If we pursue such a strategy, we could, among other things:\n\u2022\nissue equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt that may place strains on our operations;\n\u2022\nspend substantial operational, financial and management resources to integrate new businesses, technologies and products;\n\u2022\nassume substantial actual or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nreprioritize our development programs and even cease development and commercialization of our product candidates; or\n\u2022\nmerge with, or otherwise enter into a business combination with, another company in which our stockholders would receive cash and/or shares of the other company on terms that certain of our stockholders may not deem desirable.\nAlthough we intend to evaluate and consider acquisitions, reorganizations and business combinations in the future, we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisition, reorganization or business combination at this time.\nFailure to maintain our finance infrastructure and accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies and our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.\nWe are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Additionally, we are required to obtain from our independent registered public accounting firm an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. If we identify, or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies, deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ), the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to these requirements.\nIf we cannot prepare and disclose, in a timely manner, our consolidated financial statements and other required disclosures or comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or existing or new reporting requirements, or if we cannot prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury\nfrom these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nAny future relationships with customers and third-party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback laws, fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the US, our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to health information privacy and security regulation by the federal government and by the US states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that\nour business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government funded healthcare programs.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of any of our product candidates, if approved.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to stop development or, if approved, limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndelay or termination of clinical studies;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues from product sales; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any our product candidates, if approved.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development or commercialization of our product candidates. We currently carry clinical trial liability insurance at levels which we believe are appropriate for our clinical trials. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amount.\nWe are conducting a substantial portion of the clinical trials for our product candidates outside of the US. If approved, we intend to market our product candidates abroad. We will thus be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the US.\nWe are conducting a substantial portion of our clinical trials outside of the US and, if approved, we intend to market our product candidates outside of the US. We are thus subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the US. With respect to our product candidates, we may choose to partner with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems outside of the US or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems, which would indirectly expose us to these risks. Our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors associated with conducting development and marketing of our product candidates, if approved, outside of the US, including:\n\u2022\nefforts to develop an international sales, marketing and distribution organization may increase our expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the acquisition or development of product candidates or cause us to forgo profitable licensing opportunities in these geographies;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ninadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ntrade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the US Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\u2022\nregulations under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nthe effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could make the cost of our clinical trials, or the cost of drug supply or comparator drug supply to the extent conducted or sourced outside of the US, more expensive.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the US or in other foreign countries. Even if patents have issued, or do successfully issue, from patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold, license or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market any of our product candidates under patent protection, if approved, would be reduced. Since patent applications in the US and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to our\nproduct candidates. Furthermore, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications.\nThe patent portfolio for ozanimod contains patents and patent applications directed to compositions of matter for ozanimod and multiple chemical scaffolds as well as certain of their metabolites, synthetic intermediates, manufacturing methods, and methods of use. As of December 31, 2014, we owned or had exclusive license (from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI)) to seven issued US patents and five pending US patent applications as well as corresponding foreign patents and patent applications issued or pending in Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Eurasia, South Korea, China, New Zealand, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Brazil, India, Israel, and South Africa, and one pending PCT application. We expect the composition of matter patent for ozanimod (which is in-licensed from TSRI), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2029 (worldwide). It is possible, assuming ozanimod achieves regulatory approval, that the term of the composition of matter patent in the US may be extended up to a maximum of five additional years under the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act). Patent term extension may similarly be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval. We expect the other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2030 to 2032.\nThe patent portfolio for RPC4046, which is in-licensed from AbbVie, contains issued patents and pending patent applications directed to compositions of matter for RPC4046 and certain of their methods of use. As of December 31, 2014, this in-licensed portfolio consisted of two issued US patents, one pending US patent application, foreign patents in Australia, Israel and New Zealand, and corresponding foreign pending patent applications in Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Norway, Korea, Russia, and Costa Rica. We expect the issued composition of matter patent in the US, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2028. It is possible, assuming RPC4046 achieves regulatory approval, that the term of the composition of matter patent in the US may be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, although such an extension is subject to AbbVie\u2019s consent where AbbVie does not exercise its option to enter into a global collaboration for RPC4046 with us and we instead receive an exclusive worldwide license to RPC4046, and thus the possibility that AbbVie utilizes or chooses to reserve the opportunity for an extension of that patent in such context for a different drug. We expect the pending foreign patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2027. Patent term extension may similarly be available, also subject to AbbVie\u2019s consent, in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval.\nThe patent portfolio for our GLP-1R PAMs program contains pending patent applications directed to certain compositions of matter for multiple chemical scaffolds as well as one issued patent directed to certain methods of use. As of December 31, 2014, we owned three issued US patents and seven pending US patent applications and corresponding foreign patent applications, including one pending PCT application as well as applications pending in Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand and Russia. We expect the composition of matter patents in the US, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2031 to 2032. It is possible that the term of the composition of matter patents in the US, if issued, may be extended up to a maximum of five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act if a clinical candidate covered by such a patent is selected for development and subsequently receives regulatory approval. We expect the corresponding foreign patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2031 to 2032. Patent term extension may similarly be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval.\nThe patent portfolio for our proprietary GPCR structure determination portfolio, which is in-licensed from TSRI, includes patents and patent applications directed primarily to methods and compositions for obtaining high resolution crystals of G-protein coupled receptors. As of December 31, 2014, we had exclusive commercial\nlicense rights from TSRI to two US patents, one pending US patent application, foreign patents in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and United Kingdom and foreign patent applications in Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Singapore related to GPCR structure determination. We expect the patent and any patent applications in the US or corresponding foreign patent applications which issue, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2028 to 2032.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary data and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information, although we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. With respect to our proprietary GPCR structure determination technology platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to this GPCR structure determination technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing methodology for crystallization of membrane proteins, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from academic to industry scientific positions. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the US. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the US and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including interference and reexamination proceedings before the PTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Numerous US and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. As a result of searching patent literature in support of patent protection and otherwise evaluating the patent landscape, we are aware of third-party patents, and third-party patent applications which may issue, with coverage that could be asserted with respect to mechanisms of action and uses or formulations of RPC4046, which if successful could materially affect any commercialization of RPC4046 contemplated by us, if RPC4046 is approved. Similarly, we are also aware of a third-party patent, and third-party patent applications which may issue, with respect to certain dosing regimens for S1P1R modulators. Such patent contains broad claims to administering an S1P receptor agonist (including for treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) at a dosage lower than the standard daily dosage, and then increasing the dosage to the standard daily dosage (including to ameliorate a negative chronotropic effect of the S1PR agonist). While we do not believe that any claims of such patent that could otherwise materially adversely affect commercialization of ozanimod (if approved) are valid and enforceable, we may be incorrect in this belief.\nIn addition, other patents may issue from third-party patent applications with respect to certain dosing regimens with coverage broader than any product candidate being developed by a party seeking such a patent, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize ozanimod if ozanimod is approved, and if it is included within such coverage together with its dosing regimen. We are also aware of pending third-party patent applications with claims to broad generic structural formulas, which claims if issued in their broadest form could adversely affect commercialization of ozanimod, if ozanimod is approved. In addition, we are aware of a portfolio of patents and pending third party patent applications with respect to certain GPCR structure-based drug discovery and design technology. While we do not believe that any of the currently issued patents in such portfolio affect the manner in which we are utilizing our proprietary GPCR structure-based drug discovery and design technology, if a patent were to issue from any pending application in such portfolio with coverage affecting the manner in which we utilize such technology, our ability to utilize such technology or to use the results of any such utilization could be adversely affected. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. Third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize such product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patent or limit or modify our manufacturing process to avoid the coverage of the patent, or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of the formulation of any of our product candidates or any method of use of any of our product candidates, including any therapy or patient selection methods, the holder of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize such product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patent or limit or modify the formulation or use, or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Where a license to a third-party patent is needed, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement (which may include situations in which we had knowledge of an issued patent but nonetheless proceeded with activity which infringed such patent), obtain one or more licenses from third parties, limit our uses, pay royalties or redesign our infringing product candidates, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any required license would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize any of our product candidates at issue, which could harm our business significantly.\nPatent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates is dependent on, and the ability to assert patents and defend them against claims of invalidity is maintained by, third parties.\nWhile we normally seek and gain the right to prosecute fully the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when patents that relate to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. The patent portfolio for our proprietary GPCR structure determination technology and a portion of the patent portfolio for ozanimod (including a composition of matter patent for ozanimod) are each in-licensed from TSRI. Although TSRI prosecutes and maintains the patent portfolio, we have the right to consult with TSRI on any action taken. With respect to the patent portfolio for RPC4046, which is in-licensed from AbbVie, AbbVie maintains rights to\nprosecute and maintain patents and patent applications within the portfolio as well as to assert such patents against infringers within and outside the scope of our license and to defend such patents against claims of invalidity and unenforceability, although we have rights to consult with AbbVie on actions taken as well as back-up rights of prosecution and enforcement. If TSRI, AbbVie or any future licensor fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates, or if patents covering any of our product candidates are asserted against infringers or defended against claims of invalidity or unenforceability in a manner which adversely affects such coverage, our ability to develop and commercialize any such product candidate may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or one of our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party in such infringement proceeding from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly, and could put any of our patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the PTO or any foreign patent authority may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, if any license is offered at all. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the US. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as in the US. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license the use, development and commercialization rights to our product candidates or GPCR structure determination technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nThe patent portfolio for our proprietary GPCR structure determination technology and a portion of the patent portfolio for ozanimod (including a composition of matter patent for ozanimod) are each in-licensed from TSRI. The patent portfolio for RPC4046 is in-licensed from AbbVie. Under our existing license agreements, we are subject to various obligations, including diligence obligations such as development and commercialization obligations, as well as potential royalty payments and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements, our licensing partners may have the right to terminate the applicable license in whole or in part. Generally, the loss of any one of our current licenses, or any other license we may acquire in the future, could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, the loss of the license from TSRI to a portion of the patent portfolio for ozanimod, inasmuch as it includes a composition of matter patent for ozanimod, would materially adversely affect our ability to proceed with any development or potential commercialization of ozanimod. In addition, the loss of the license from AbbVie for RPC4046 would likely result in the termination of our efforts with respect to RPC4046.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by an issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering an invention;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npending patent applications that we own or have licensed may not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or have licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the PTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the US in\nseveral stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals and rely on such third parties to effect payment of these fees with respect to the patents and patent applications that we own, and we rely upon our licensors to effect payment of these fees with respect to the patents and patent applications that we license. The PTO and various non-US governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with respect to the patents and patent applications that we own, and we rely upon our licensors to effect compliance with respect to the patents and patent applications that we license. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nIn 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Leahy-Smith Act) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to US patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The PTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not become effective until March 2013, 18 months after its enactment. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former or other employers.\nMany of our employees and consultants, including our senior management and our scientific founders, have been employed or retained by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees and consultants, including each member of our senior management and each of our scientific founders, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment or retention. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees or consultants have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s or consultants former or other employer. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with our senior management or scientific founders, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and/or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development\nactivities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar legislation outside of the US by extending the patent terms and obtaining data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, if any, one or more US patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request.\nWe expect the composition of a matter patent for ozanimod in the US, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid and it withstands any challenge, would expire in 2029. It is possible, assuming ozanimod achieves regulatory approval in the US and a timely application is made, that the term of the composition of matter patent in the US may be extended up to a maximum of five additional years under the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect the composition of matter patent for RPC4046 in the US if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid and it withstands any challenge, to expire in 2028. It is possible, assuming RPC4046 achieves regulatory approval in the US and a timely application is made, that the term of the composition of matter patent in the US may be extended up to a maximum of five additional years under the Hatch-Waxman Act, although such an extension for RPC4046 is subject to AbbVie\u2019s consent where AbbVie does not exercise its option to enter into a global collaboration for RPC4046 with us and we instead receive an exclusive worldwide license to RPC4046, and thus the possibility in such context that AbbVie utilizes such extension for a different drug.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock may at times be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, these factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated adverse results or delays in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\npositive outcomes, or faster development results than expected, by parties developing product candidates that are competitive with our product candidates, as well as approval of any such competitive product candidates;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour failure to secure collaboration agreements for our product candidates or actual or perceived unfavorable terms of such agreements;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u2022\nour dependence on third parties, including CROs as well as manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour failure to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed any financial guidance or development timelines that we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and manage such growth;\n\u2022\nissuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\neffects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash and may not use it effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the use of our cash and might not use it in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. If we do not invest or use our cash in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of February 16, 2015, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 41.1% of our outstanding stock. Therefore, these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine or significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control or significantly influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares purchased by affiliates. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. Such sales may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plan(s), our board of directors or compensation committee, and in certain instances (involving non-executive new hires) our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, are authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our employees, directors and consultants. As of December 31, 2014, 360,301 shares of our common stock were available for future grant under our 2013 Stock Plan. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2013 Plan will be increased (i) from time to time by the number of shares of our common stock forfeited upon the expiration, cancellation, forfeiture, cash settlement or other termination of awards under our 2008 Stock Plan, and (ii) on January 1 of each year through January 1, 2023, by the lesser of (x) a number of additional shares of our common stock representing four percent of our then-outstanding shares of common stock and (y) another amount that our board of directors determines. As of December 31, 2014, the number of shares of our common stock available for future grant under our ESPP was 343,000. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance\nunder our ESPP will be increased on January 1 of each year by the lesser of (x) a number of additional shares of our common stock representing one percent of our then-outstanding shares of common stock and (y) another amount that our board of directors determines. Future option grants and issuances of common stock under our 2013 Stock Plan or ESPP may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management. These provisions:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes, each serving staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022\nauthorize the board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, or the chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nestablish the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain derivative actions or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine;\n\u2022\nrequire the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2\u20443% of the total votes eligible to be cast in the election of directors to amend, alter, change or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to our stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13942, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RCPT"}
